"FAU Secures $1.4 Million Grant to Save Wildlife in Florida Everglades","FAU researchers conduct surveys and fieldwork in the Florida Everglades. (Photo by Alex Dolce) Grant Snapshot: Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science has received a five-year, $1.4 million grant from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study dry-season prey concentrations in the Florida Everglades. Led by Michelle L. Petersen, Ph.D., the project will collect and analyze data on aquatic prey and habitat conditions, helping scientists understand the key factors that drive wading bird nesting success. The research will fill a critical gap in knowledge by showing where and when prey concentrate during the dry season, information that is essential for guiding ecosystem restoration under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. By linking water conditions, prey availability and bird nesting, the project will support more effective management strategies and help protect the Everglades’ iconic wildlife for the future. Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science has received a five-year, $1,427,679 grant from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to fund a project titled, “Dry Season Prey Concentrations in the Florida Everglades.” The project is led by Michelle L. Petersen, Ph.D., assistant research professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, and director of the Environmental Science Program in the School of Environmental, Coastal and Ocean Sustainability. Petersen and her team will collect and analyze critical data on aquatic prey and habitat conditions during the dry season across the freshwater Everglades, providing essential insight into one of the most important drivers of wading bird nesting success. “This project is incredibly exciting because it allows us to quantify the link between water conditions, fish populations and wading bird nesting across the Everglades,” said Petersen. “By identifying when and where prey concentrations occur, we can better understand what drives nesting success and provide information that directly supports restoration efforts in this unique and vital ecosystem.” The research directly supports the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), a large-scale effort authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to restore South Florida’s ecosystem by modifying water management practices. A vital component of CERP is the Monitoring and Assessment Plan (MAP), which was developed to evaluate ecological responses to restoration, track progress toward restoration goals, and guide adaptive management decisions. “One of the biggest questions we’re trying to answer through this project is how wading birds respond to changes in water levels, especially during the dry season when the concentration of prey can make or break their nesting success,” said Petersen. Declines in wading bird populations have been linked to reductions in fish and other aquatic prey, particularly when these prey fail to concentrate in small patches that birds can efficiently exploit. Research shows that wet-season prey abundance alone does not predict nesting success; rather, it is the formation of dense prey concentrations in drying wetlands that largely determines whether wading birds can sustain large, successful colonies. Petersen’s project will provide quantitative data on where, when and how these concentrations occur across the Everglades landscape, including Everglades National Park, the Water Conservation Areas, and the C-111 Basin. The project builds on prior MAP-supported research and will employ a probabilistic, multi-stage sampling framework designed to measure maximum aquatic prey densities and track inter-annual variability in relation to hydrologic conditions. Researchers will also examine how local site characteristics, regional prey populations, and microtopography influence prey concentrations. These data will fill a critical knowledge gap: prior to MAP studies, little was known about the location, frequency and ecological importance of fish concentrations in drying wetlands because monitoring traditionally ceased once water levels dropped too low for boat access. Beyond its ecological significance, the project contributes to the broader mission of the Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units by promoting ecosystem-based research, training the next generation of scientists and informing science-based management decisions. “Dr. Petersen’s work underscores the vital role university-led research plays in driving effective ecosystem restoration and generating studies that inform crucial state and federal agency actions on comprehensive environmental stewardship,” said Valery E. Forbes, Ph.D., dean of the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “This grant reflects the excellence of her work and commitment to producing impactful science that will safeguard the Everglades for generations to come.” Fieldwork will include systematic dry-season sampling using a stratified design to capture prey densities across the Everglades’ complex freshwater habitats. Data collection will focus on shallow sloughs undergoing seasonal drying – areas where prey concentrations are expected to peak – and will employ standardized methods to ensure comparability across sites and years. The results will be used to inform CERP’s restoration strategies and provide managers with the evidence needed to support wading bird populations and overall ecosystem recovery. “We anticipate this project will greatly improve our understanding of the links between hydrology, prey availability, and wading bird nesting, providing crucial insight into how restoration efforts can most effectively achieve the goals of CERP,” said Petersen. “By combining long-term monitoring with innovative analysis, this work marks an important step forward in both the science and management of one of the world’s most iconic wetland ecosystems.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.","https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/everglades-wildlife-grant.php"
"FAU's CAROSEL Offers New 'Spin' on Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring","Jordon Beckler, Ph.D., and Mason Thackston (in the water) test their new device, the Chamber ARray for Observing Sediment Exchanges Long-term or CAROSEL for short. Study Snapshot: FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute researchers have developed the CAROSEL (Chamber ARray for Observing Sediment Exchanges Long-term), an autonomous underwater system that continuously measures how nutrients like ammonium move between sediments and overlying water. For the first time, scientists can observe these exchanges in real time, multiple times a day, over extended periods – offering an unprecedented look at how sediments influence water chemistry. This insight is vital because nutrient releases from sediments can fuel harmful algal blooms, degrade water quality and disrupt aquatic ecosystems. By revealing how quickly these processes respond to changes in light, oxygen and weather, CAROSEL provides a powerful new tool for managing nutrient pollution and improving the health of lakes, estuaries and coastal waters. Beneath the surface of lakes and coastal waters lies a hidden world of sediment that plays a crucial role in the health of aquatic ecosystems. “Benthic fluxes” of nitrogen and phosphorus, such as releases of these dissolved nutrients from sediments to their overlying waters,can fuel algae growth and toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs), which degrade water quality, disrupt wildlife and recreation, and reduce property values. Sediments act as a natural archive, offering historical insights into ecosystem health. However, to fully understand nutrient exchanges between sediment and water, scientists rely on measurements of benthic fluxes, like the amount of nitrogen transported across the sediment/water interface in typical units of pounds per square meter of sediment area per day. Traditional monitoring methods are slow, costly and challenging, and while newer autonomous systems show promise, few studies have explored how these systems can reveal how sediments contribute to or sustain HABs – an essential step in managing and protecting aquatic ecosystems. For example, in Florida’s Lake Okeechobee, benthic nutrient fluxes are the dominant source of nutrients fueling algal growth in this shallow turbid water body. Florida Atlantic University Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute researchers are the first to continuously track the exchanges of different forms of nitrogen between bottom sediments and the overlying water. Most importantly, their novel approach enables measuring how much ammonium (NH₄⁺) is released from sediments in real time, multiple times a day, over an extended period – offering an unprecedented, detailed view of this critical nutrient exchange and preferred nutrient source of algal blooms. Their secret weapon? A new device called CAROSEL – short for Chamber ARray for Observing Sediment Exchanges Long-term. The CAROSEL is a smart, underwater monitoring system designed to study how nutrients and other chemicals move between lake or ocean sediments and the water above. Unlike older methods that required two boat (or ship) trips and manpower to deploy and retrieve instrumentation packages to obtain only a single benthic flux data time point, the CAROSEL works automatically, taking multiple measurements each day without human help for periods of several weeks. For the study, researchers tested the CAROSEL in a shallow freshwater retention pond on the FAU Harbor Branch campus in Fort Pierce. The goal was to better understand the interplay of nutrients and oxygen over both day and multi-day cycles, enabling better insights into the total nitrogen available as a function of the time of day and the weather. However, it also improved estimates of the nutrients removed from this pond system over time. These retention ponds – found all over Florida – are a common Best Management Practice (BMP) employed as part of the state’s regulations to do just that: eliminate the nutrients flowing to coastal estuaries. Results of their research, published in the journal Limnology & Oceanography, also reveal that oxygen fluxes in the water followed a daily rhythm: increasing during the day from photosynthesis and decreasing at night due to respiration. Conversely, sediments consistently consumed oxygen from the overlying water. The sediments also released NH₄⁺ throughout the study, while the water column showed signs of nitrogen being added during the day and broken down at night – a surprising finding considering photosynthetic growth during the day would be expected to consume nutrients. After rainstorms, both NH₄⁺ and nitrate fluxes changed quickly, showing how sensitive these processes are to the environment. It was also clear that nitrogen removal through nitrification/denitrification – the main process desired in these BMP systems – was intense but also highly variable over time. Uniquely, the CAROSEL captured high-frequency, real-time data, revealing sharp, short-term fluctuations in nutrient and oxygen exchange. These findings challenge the common assumption that sediment processes are slow or steady, and underscore how tools like the CAROSEL can uncover the hidden, dynamic forces shaping water quality. “What’s most exciting is that CAROSEL gave us a detailed, hour-by-hour view of how weather and environmental changes directly affect the chemistry between the lake bottom and the water above,” said Jordon Beckler, Ph.D., senior author, an associate research professor at FAU Harbor Branch and an FAU Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) fellow. “That level of detail helps us untangle the complex chain reactions happening in lakes and estuaries – something that’s been incredibly hard to do until now with such low-resolution conventional benthic flux data. We see this technology as a powerful new tool for understanding how these fluxes drive ecosystem dynamics, especially given the explosion of harmful algal blooms globally over the last few decades. I see sediments, which cover about 70% of the Earth’s surface, as the next water, soil or air – for which we already have developed an appreciation for their health and conservation.” This detailed view will help scientists understand how quickly nutrients cycle and how factors like light, temperature and storms drive those changes – key to improving water quality monitoring and management. The CAROSEL shows strong potential as a tool for tracking and responding to issues like nutrient pollution, HABs, low oxygen “dead zones,” carbon cycling, and even organic and heavy metal contaminants amid shifting environmental conditions. Study co-authors are Donald Nuzzio, Ph.D., president of Analytical Instrument Systems, Inc.; and Csaba Vaczo, a mechanical engineer at FAU Harbor Branch. This work was supported by the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation and an FAU I-SENSE seed grant, as well as the Florida Department of Environmental Protection Innovative Technologies for HAB Mitigation Program, for supporting research directly leading to the conception of the CAROSEL (Grant #MN016).

"'Frazzled' Fruit Flies Help Unravel How Neural Circuits Stay Wired","Extreme close-up of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) using scanning electron microscopy. Study Snapshot: Florida Atlantic University neuroscientists have identified a surprising new role for a protein called “Frazzled” (DCC in humans) in helping fruit fly neurons connect and communicate at lightning speed. Studying the Giant Fiber System, which controls the flies’ rapid escape reflex, they found that when Frazzled is missing or mutated, neurons fail to form proper electrical connections, slowing neural responses and weakening muscle control. Using genetic tools, the researchers showed that the intracellular portion of Frazzled alone could restore normal communication, revealing that this part of the protein regulates the genes needed to build gap junctions. Florida Atlantic University neuroscientists have uncovered a surprising role for a protein named “Frazzled” (known as DCC in mammals) in the nervous system of fruit flies, showing how it helps neurons connect and communicate with lightning speed. The discovery sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms that ensure neurons form reliable connections, or synapses, a process essential for all nervous systems, from insects to humans. In the study, researchers focused on the Giant Fiber (GF) System of Drosophila, a neural circuit that controls this fruit fly’s rapid escape reflex. With this work, the team has not only revealed a key molecular player in fruit fly neural circuits but also demonstrated the power of combining genetics, imaging, physiology and computational modeling to uncover how brains stay wired – and what happens when they don’t. The results, published in the journal eNeuro, reveal that when Frazzled is missing or mutated, the system falters: neurons fail to form proper electrical connections, the fly’s neural responses slow down, and communication between the GF neurons and the muscles they control weakens. These defects are linked to a loss of gap junctions, tiny channels that allow neurons to transmit signals directly and rapidly. In particular, the team found that the loss of a protein called shaking-B(neural+16), which forms these junctions in the presynaptic terminals, underlies much of the misfiring. To understand Frazzled’s precise role, the researchers used a genetic tool known as the UAS-GAL4 system to reintroduce different pieces of the Frazzled protein into mutant flies. Strikingly, just the intracellular portion of Frazzled – the part inside the neuron that can influence gene expression – was enough to restore both the structure of the synapses and the speed of neuronal communication. When this portion was disrupted, such as by deleting a key domain called P3 or mutating a crucial site within it, the rescue failed, indicating that Frazzled’s control of gene activity is essential for building gap junctions. Beyond laboratory experiments, the team also created a computational model of the GF System, simulating how the number of gap junctions affects the neurons’ ability to fire reliably. The model confirmed that even small changes in gap junction density can drastically alter the speed and precision of neural signals. “The combination of experimental and computational work allowed us to see not just that Frazzled matters, but exactly how it shapes the connections that let neurons talk to each other,” said Rodney Murphey, Ph.D., senior author and a professor of biological sciences in the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Our next steps are to explore whether similar mechanisms control neural circuits in other species, including mammals, and to see how this might influence learning, memory or even repair after injury.” Interestingly, while Frazzled has long been studied as a guidance molecule – helping neurons grow along the correct paths – the study revealed that its intracellular domain also directly regulates synapse formation. Flies lacking Frazzled often showed neurons that grew in random directions, failing to reach their targets. Restoring the intracellular domain corrected many of these guidance errors, demonstrating a dual role for Frazzled in both wiring neurons and fine-tuning their communication. This work also draws parallels to other organisms. Similar proteins in worms and vertebrates have been shown to influence chemical synapses, suggesting that Frazzled and its relatives may play a broadly conserved role in shaping neural networks. By showing how a single protein controls both the physical and functional aspects of electrical synapses, this study opens a window into the fundamental rules governing nervous system assembly. “Understanding how neurons form reliable connections is a central question in neuroscience,” Murphey said. “Frazzled gives us a clear handle on one piece of that puzzle. Our findings could inform future studies of neural development, neurodegenerative diseases and strategies to repair damaged circuits.” Study co-authors are first author Juan Lopez, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science; Jana Boerner, Ph.D., managing director of the Advanced Cell Imaging Core within the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute; Kelli Robbins, research staff in FAU’s Department of Biological Sciences; and Rodrigo Pena, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biological sciences in the Charles E.

"FAU Researchers Make Great 'Strides' in Gait Analysis Technology","Microsoft’s Azure Kinect depth camera captures 3D data, color images and body movements for motion tracking. Study Snapshot: A first-of-its-kind study explored whether more accessible technologies – foot-mounted wearable sensors and a 3D depth camera – could accurately measure how people walk, offering a practical alternative to traditional gait analysis tools. Gait, or walking pattern, is a key health indicator used to detect fall risk, monitor rehabilitation and identify early signs of conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Traditional systems like the Zeno™ Walkway, the gold standard for gait analysis, are accurate but expensive, bulky and not easily used outside of lab settings. The researchers tested three systems side-by-side in a real clinical environment: wearable foot sensors, the Microsoft Azure Kinect depth camera, and the Zeno™ Walkway. They found that the foot-mounted sensors and depth camera matched the gold standard’s accuracy across most gait metrics, even in complex settings with people moving in the background. In contrast, lower-back sensors were less reliable. These results suggest that wearable and camera-based systems could make detailed gait analysis more scalable, cost-effective and suitable for remote or routine clinical use. A study from the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) at Florida Atlantic University reveals that foot-mounted wearable sensors and a 3D depth camera can accurately measure how people walk – even in busy clinical environments – offering a powerful and more accessible alternative to traditional gait assessment tools. Gait, the pattern of how a person walks, is an increasingly important marker of overall health, used in detecting fall risk, monitoring rehabilitation, and identifying early signs of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Although electronic walkways like the Zeno™ Walkway have long been considered the gold standard for gait analysis, their high cost, large footprint and limited portability restrict widespread use – especially outside controlled lab settings. To overcome these barriers, FAU researchers and collaborators conducted the first known study to simultaneously evaluate three different sensing technologies: APDM wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs); Microsoft’s’ Azure Kinect depth camera; and the Zeno™ Walkway – under identical, real-world clinical conditions. The depth-sensing camera captures 3D data, color images, and body movements for use in AI, robotics and motion tracking. The study findings, published in the journal Sensors, reveal that foot-mounted IMUs and the Azure Kinect not only match the accuracy of traditional tools but also enable scalable, remote and cost-effective gait analysis. “This is the first time these three technologies have been directly compared side by side in the same clinical setting,” said Behnaz Ghoraani, Ph.D., senior author and an associate professor in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and an I-SENSE fellow. “We wanted to answer a question the field has been asking for a long time: Can more accessible tools like wearables and markerless cameras reliably match the clinical standard for detailed gait analysis? The answer is yes – especially when it comes to foot-mounted sensors and the Azure Kinect.” The study recruited 20 adults aged 52 to 82, who completed both single-task and dual-task walking trials – a method often used to mimic real-world walking conditions that require multitasking or divided attention. Each participant’s gait was captured by the three systems at the same time, thanks to a custom-built hardware platform the FAU researchers developed, which precisely synchronized all data sources to the millisecond. Researchers evaluated 11 different gait markers, including basic metrics like walking speed and step frequency, as well as more detailed indicators such as stride time, support phases and swing time. These markers were analyzed using statistical methods to compare each device’s measurements with those from the Zeno™ Walkway. The results were clear: foot-mounted sensors showed near-perfect agreement with the walkway across nearly all gait markers. The Azure Kinect also performed impressively, maintaining strong accuracy even in the complex, real-world clinic setting where multiple people, including caregivers and staff, were present in the camera’s field of view. In contrast, lumbar-mounted sensors, which are commonly used in wearable gait studies, demonstrated significantly lower accuracy and consistency, particularly for fine-grained gait cycle events. Many studies use lower-back sensors because they are easy to mount. However, data from this study shows that they often fail to capture the details clinicians care most about – especially timing-based markers that can reveal early signs of neurological problems. “By testing these tools in a realistic clinical environment with all the unpredictable visual noise that comes with it, we’ve made great strides toward validating them for everyday use,” said Ghoraani. “This isn’t just a lab experiment. These technologies are ready to meet real-world demands.” Importantly, the study is the first to benchmark the Azure Kinect against an electronic walkway for micro-temporal gait markers – filling a critical gap in the literature and confirming the device’s potential clinical value. “The implications of this research are far-reaching,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science. “As health care systems increasingly embrace telehealth and remote monitoring, scalable technologies like wearable foot sensors and depth cameras are emerging as powerful tools. They enable clinicians to track mobility, detect early signs of functional decline, and tailor interventions – without the need for costly, space-intensive equipment.” Study co-authors are first author Marjan Nassajpour and Mahmoud Seifallahi, both doctoral students in the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science; and Amie Rosenfeld, a physical therapist researcher and assistant director of education; Magdalena I.

"FAU Historian Traces How U.S. Nursing Homes Evolved into Big Business","Postcard showing a typical Americana Nursing Center design, as employed in the facility that opened in Normal, Illinois in 1962 (author’s private collection). Study Snapshot: In a new article, historian Willa Granger, Ph.D., explores how a little-known Illinois company, the Americana Corporation, helped shape the modern nursing home in postwar America. During the 1960s, Americana developed a replicable model of suburban, hospital-adjacent facilities that blended real estate, institutional medicine and franchising – transforming eldercare into a standardized, corporate system tied to federal policy and funding. Granger’s research reveals how architecture was central to this shift, not just housing older adults but creating an entire system of care. By examining the physical and institutional design of Americana’s homes, she uncovers how midcentury ideals around aging, medicine and profit became embedded in the built environment – a legacy that continues to define long-term care today. In postwar America, as suburbs spread and federal social welfare programs expanded, one underexamined building type quietly became a fixture of the American health care landscape: the nursing home. In a new article published in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, historian Willa Granger, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the School of Architecture within Florida Atlantic University’s Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, examines how a little-known company from midcentury Illinois helped lay the groundwork for the modern nursing home industry in the United States. Granger’s research centers on the Americana Corporation, a for-profit eldercare chain that pioneered a replicable model of suburban, hospital-adjacent nursing homes during the 1960s – ultimately reshaping not only how older adults are cared for, but where and by whom. Through meticulous archival research, Granger draws from internal business records, marketing materials, and federal policy documents to show how nursing homes evolved from small, local operations – often run out of converted houses – into standardized, medically regulated institutions tied to federal funding and corporate expansion. Granger’s article is one of the first comprehensive architectural histories of the nursing home in the U.S. By placing this overlooked building type at the center of debates about health care, policy and design, she opens new questions about how architecture has participated in shaping social institutions – not only reflecting cultural attitudes toward aging but actively producing them. “This is not just a story about nursing homes. It is a story about how buildings mediate care, how federal policy influences physical space, and how the structure of eldercare became a mirror of midcentury American life – its promises, its anxieties and its enduring contradictions,” said Granger. Americana wasn’t just building nursing homes. It was building a system – one that merged health care with real estate, design and franchising. In doing so, it helped redefine what eldercare looked like, both physically and institutionally. Founded in 1960, Americana was conceived to bridge the growing gap “between hospital and the private home,” according to its early marketing materials. Americana’s facilities were strategically sited near regional hospitals in growing suburban and rural markets. Its facilities were purpose-built, single-story structures styled in familiar neocolonial architecture – with brick facades, white porticos and decorative shutters – but internally organized according to clinical, hospital-style layouts. Americana’s leaders borrowed tactics from the booming motel industry, blending real estate development, standardization and institutional medicine to build nursing homes across the Midwest that felt like home but functioned like hospitals. By 1969, the company had developed more than 30 locations across nine states. Its success was driven not only by design and branding, but by a unique moment in U.S. policy. Granger’s article demonstrates how federal programs like the Hill-Burton Act, Social Security, and especially Medicare, helped incentivize and normalize this new model of care. The very programs meant to support aging Americans also helped consolidate eldercare into a professionalized, increasingly privatized industry. “Americana shows how architecture was used not just to house people, but to create an entire system of care – one shaped by regulation, profit and a vision of aging that was both medicalized and marketable,” said Granger. Granger’s study raises urgent questions about the legacy of this shift and its continued relevance today. “As the U.S. faces a rapidly aging population and mounting pressures on long-term care, the origins of the modern nursing home reveal how deeply our built environments reflect the values – and blind spots – of their time,” said Granger. “History reminds us that decisions about architecture, policy and profit are never neutral; they shape the everyday lives of vulnerable people. Understanding where these systems came from is essential if we hope to imagine and build something better.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.","https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/history-nursing-homes.php"
"Where a Child Lives - Not Just Diet - Raises Type 2 Diabetes Risk","Findings reveal strong links between type 2 diabetes risk and environmental factors like walkability, litter, and access to processed foods. Children in food-insecure homes or areas with limited green space showed higher risk indicators. Study Snapshot: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising sharply among children, now accounting for up to 45% of youth diabetes cases – compared to just 1% to 2% before the mid-1990s. While obesity remains the strongest risk factor, a new study highlights how early-life environments also shape T2D risk. Researchers analyzed data from 174,000 children nationwide, including nearly 50,000 under age 5, and found that neighborhood conditions, caregiver health, food insecurity, and use of assistance programs significantly influenced diabetes outcomes. Although T2D remains rare in very young children, the study found strong links between risk and environmental factors like neighborhood walkability, litter, and access to processed foods through assistance programs. For example, children in food-insecure homes or urban areas with fewer green spaces had higher risk indicators. The findings suggest that effective prevention must go beyond individual habits, focusing instead on improving nutrition quality, reducing sugary drink intake, and creating healthier, more active environments for young children. Type 2 diabetes (T2D), once considered an adult-onset disease, is increasing at alarming rates in children and adolescents. Before the mid-1990s, just 1% to 2% of youth with diabetes had T2D. Today, that number has skyrocketed to between 24% and 45%, with the average age of diagnosis hovering around 13 years old. This troubling trend closely tracks with the ongoing rise in childhood obesity. While genetics, diet and physical activity all play roles in T2D risk, new research from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine highlights another key factor in T2D risk: where a child lives. Researchers conducted a large-scale study to explore how T2D is emerging in the youngest children. Using data from the National Survey of Children’s Health spanning 2016 to 2020, the team focused on a subgroup of children from birth to age 5 – a rarely studied demographic in T2D research. The study analyzed responses from caregivers of more than 174,000 children nationwide, including nearly 50,000 in the early childhood group. Researchers examined not only diet and physical activity but also broader influences like neighborhood conditions, caregiver health, food security, and participation in government assistance programs. Their goal: to better understand how early life experiences and environments might shape the risk of developing T2D. The results, published in the journal Pediatric Research, found that while the overall prevalence of T2D in children under age 5 remained low and relatively stable over the five-year period, the disease’s development appears to be tied more to social and environmental factors than to individual behaviors alone. Certain neighborhood and household characteristics stood out. For example, in both 2016 and 2020, having a library nearby was significantly associated with childhood T2D diagnoses. This association is thought to reflect broader neighborhood and behavioral patterns that encourage sedentary, indoor activities rather than outdoor physical engagement. Libraries tend to reflect more urban environments compared to areas with high neighborhood walkability and green space. “Research has shown that neighborhood environments – such as the presence of sidewalks, parks or other green spaces – can directly influence a child’s ability to engage in physical activity, and in turn, affect their risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes,” said Lea Sacca, Ph.D., senior author and an assistant professor of population health in the Schmidt College of Medicine. Caregivers also increasingly reported neighborhood issues like litter and vandalism. These environmental concerns grew steadily between 2016 and 2020 and were evident across both the overall sample and the youngest age group. Other notable associations emerged in early childhood include receiving help from neighbors in 2016 and neighborhood walkability in 2019. Study findings also showed that in 2017, access to free or reduced-cost meals showed a similar link to neighborhood and household characteristics. From 2019 to 2020, there was a marked increase in the use of government assistance programs such as food stamps, free meal plans and cash support. While these programs may help address food insecurity, their impact on nutrition quality is more complicated. Participation in programs like SNAP and school meals has been linked to increased intake of processed, energy-dense foods high in sugar and fat, which may contribute to the risk of T2D. “While this finding could suggest improved access to food, previous research shows that relying on food assistance doesn’t always equate to better nutrition,” said Sacca. “For instance, children in food-insecure households tend to have poorer blood sugar control and higher hospitalization rates. Some research even suggests that participants in programs like SNAP may have worse diet quality than non-participants from similarly low-income households.” The researchers say effective T2D prevention and early detection efforts must consider both environmental factors and food quality – particularly neighborhood design and access to nutritious options – for lasting and widespread impact. Nonetheless, obesity remains the strongest and most common risk factor for TD2 in children. Children who are significantly overweight are four times more likely to develop the disease by age 25 than those with a healthy weight. “With obesity rates continuing to rise, especially among young children, prevention efforts are critical,” said Sacca. One particularly urgent target is reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, which are closely linked to both obesity and diabetes risk. Notably, nearly 70% of children aged 2 to 5 consume sugar-sweetened beverages daily. While some school-based policies like vending machine restrictions and small beverage taxes have led to slight decreases in consumption on school grounds, overall intake remains high. The researchers suggest that more assertive policies, including full bans in schools and larger taxes, may be needed. At the same time, evidence from successful school-based programs shows that improving dietary habits and increasing physical activity among children is achievable with the right support. “The rise in early-onset type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern,” said Sacca. “Addressing it requires a comprehensive strategy. That includes improving access to nutritious foods, creating healthier neighborhood environments, and investing in policies that promote long-term wellness from the very start of life.” Study co-authors are FAU medical students Ayden Dunn, Paige Brinzo, Sahar Kaleem, Austin Lent, Madison Etzel, Jennifer Mendonca, Vama Jhumkhawala and Milad Khoury, M.D., a clinical affiliate assistant professor of endocrinology in FAU’s Department of Medicine.

"FAU's Queen Conch Lab Receives Prestigious International Award","Megan Davis, Ph.D., (left) and Becky Holt, assistant director of the Queen Conch Lab, receiving the award during the Responsible Seafood Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia. Award Snapshot: FAU Harbor Branch researchers have received the prestigious 2025 Responsible Seafood Innovation Award in Aquaculture from the Global Seafood Alliance for its Queen Conch Lab’s pioneering work in sustainable aquaculture. Led by Megan Davis, Ph.D., the research team has developed mobile lab hatcheries – trailer-based systems that support queen conch restoration in Caribbean communities lacking traditional infrastructure. These mobile hatcheries help rebuild wild conch populations while creating local opportunities in education, employment, and food security. FAU was recognized for its innovative, community-focused approach, which blends science, sustainability, and cultural preservation to address the urgent decline of a species vital to the region’s ecosystems and economies. The Florida Atlantic University Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute’s Queen Conch Lab, led by research professor Megan Davis, Ph.D., has been named the recipient of the 2025 Responsible Seafood Innovation Award in Aquaculture from the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA). The award honors the Queen Conch Lab’s development of mobile lab hatcheries designed to help restore the threatened Caribbean queen conch. These self-contained, trailer-based hatcheries bring advanced aquaculture capabilities to coastal communities across the Caribbean, many of which lack traditional infrastructure. This innovation is not only helping to rebuild wild conch populations but is also generating opportunities in education, employment and food security throughout the region. GSA is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing responsible seafood practices through education, advocacy and third-party certification. GSA works across the seafood supply chain – from aquaculture to wild fisheries – to promote environmental responsibility, social accountability, food safety and animal welfare. Through its standards, events and media platforms, the organization helps ensure that seafood is produced in ways that are sustainable and ethically managed. This prestigious award was recently presented to Davis and Becky Holt, assistant director of the Queen Conch Lab, during the Responsible Seafood Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia, and recognizes transformative efforts in sustainable aquaculture that contribute to the future of responsible seafood production globally. The queen conch is a culturally and economically vital species that has long sustained Caribbean communities through its role in nutrition, trade and tradition. However, due to decades of overfishing and habitat loss, the species has seen significant declines. In 2024, NOAA listed the queen conch as ‘threatened’ under the Endangered Species Act. Current data suggests that commercial fishing in The Bahamas could become unsustainable within the next 10 to 15 years. Recognizing the urgency of this crisis, FAU’s Queen Conch Lab set out to pioneer a scalable, science-based solution that integrates restoration, education and community engagement. At the heart of this solution is the mobile lab hatchery – a laboratory built inside a custom trailer, similar in size to a food truck, outfitted with advanced aquaculture systems including solar power, aeration, flow-through and recirculating saltwater systems, and algae and conch cultivation setups. These units are designed to be transported to remote areas and connected directly to local seawater sources, making them fully operational hatcheries that require no permanent facilities. Since the first trailer was deployed to Great Exuma, The Bahamas in 2022, eight additional hatcheries have been launched in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, The Bahamas and Florida, with more in development for deployment to other nations including Turks and Caicos and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. These mobile hatcheries are capable of producing up to 2,000 juvenile queen conch annually, supporting both ecosystem restoration and sustainable seafood initiatives. However, their impact goes far beyond biological output. Each hatchery becomes a local hub for science education, job training and community empowerment. Through close partnerships with local organizations such as Blue Action Lab in Grand Bahama, Conservación ConCiencia and Villa Pesquera de Naguabo in Puerto Rico, University of West Indies in Jamaica, and other grassroots conservation and fishing groups – the Queen Conch Lab model ensures that local expertise and cultural knowledge are integrated into every stage of the process. “This recognition from the Global Seafood Alliance is an incredible milestone for our team and our many community partners,” said Davis. “It reflects the idea that science can be mobile, accessible and rooted in local collaboration. What started as a simple concept – putting a hatchery in a trailer – has become a powerful tool for helping to restore queen conch and supporting the culture, food security, seagrass ecosystems and identity of Caribbean communities.” The GSA’s Responsible Seafood Innovation Award highlights innovations that not only address pressing environmental challenges but also serve as catalysts for broader change in how seafood is produced, consumed and valued. “The work coming out of our Queen Conch Lab is extraordinary – not just in its scientific merit, but in its human impact,” said James Sullivan, Ph.D., executive director of FAU Harbor Branch. “The mobile hatcheries represent a new paradigm in aquaculture – bringing the lab to the people, training the next generation of marine scientists, and building resilience in ecosystems and economies alike. This is exactly the kind of bold, collaborative and community-driven work that sustainable seafood needs right now. It’s setting a global standard for what responsible aquaculture can and should look like.” Looking ahead, the Queen Conch Lab continues to pursue its long-term goal of establishing a community-based queen conch farm in every Caribbean country. The lab is also expanding its training programs, educational outreach, and scientific research in collaboration with a growing network of local and international partners. “As Caribbean nations confront the dual challenges of environmental degradation and economic vulnerability, our Queen Conch Lab offers a hopeful, actionable model for restoration and resilience,” said Davis.
