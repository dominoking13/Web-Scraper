"Where a Child Lives - Not Just Diet - Raises Type 2 Diabetes Risk","Findings reveal strong links between type 2 diabetes risk and environmental factors like walkability, litter, and access to processed foods. Children in food-insecure homes or areas with limited green space showed higher risk indicators. Study Snapshot: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising sharply among children, now accounting for up to 45% of youth diabetes cases – compared to just 1% to 2% before the mid-1990s. While obesity remains the strongest risk factor, a new study highlights how early-life environments also shape T2D risk. Researchers analyzed data from 174,000 children nationwide, including nearly 50,000 under age 5, and found that neighborhood conditions, caregiver health, food insecurity, and use of assistance programs significantly influenced diabetes outcomes. Although T2D remains rare in very young children, the study found strong links between risk and environmental factors like neighborhood walkability, litter, and access to processed foods through assistance programs. For example, children in food-insecure homes or urban areas with fewer green spaces had higher risk indicators. The findings suggest that effective prevention must go beyond individual habits, focusing instead on improving nutrition quality, reducing sugary drink intake, and creating healthier, more active environments for young children. Type 2 diabetes (T2D), once considered an adult-onset disease, is increasing at alarming rates in children and adolescents. Before the mid-1990s, just 1% to 2% of youth with diabetes had T2D. Today, that number has skyrocketed to between 24% and 45%, with the average age of diagnosis hovering around 13 years old. This troubling trend closely tracks with the ongoing rise in childhood obesity. While genetics, diet and physical activity all play roles in T2D risk, new research from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine highlights another key factor in T2D risk: where a child lives. Researchers conducted a large-scale study to explore how T2D is emerging in the youngest children. Using data from the National Survey of Children’s Health spanning 2016 to 2020, the team focused on a subgroup of children from birth to age 5 – a rarely studied demographic in T2D research. The study analyzed responses from caregivers of more than 174,000 children nationwide, including nearly 50,000 in the early childhood group. Researchers examined not only diet and physical activity but also broader influences like neighborhood conditions, caregiver health, food security, and participation in government assistance programs. Their goal: to better understand how early life experiences and environments might shape the risk of developing T2D. The results, published in the journal Pediatric Research, found that while the overall prevalence of T2D in children under age 5 remained low and relatively stable over the five-year period, the disease’s development appears to be tied more to social and environmental factors than to individual behaviors alone. Certain neighborhood and household characteristics stood out. For example, in both 2016 and 2020, having a library nearby was significantly associated with childhood T2D diagnoses. This association is thought to reflect broader neighborhood and behavioral patterns that encourage sedentary, indoor activities rather than outdoor physical engagement. Libraries tend to reflect more urban environments compared to areas with high neighborhood walkability and green space. “Research has shown that neighborhood environments – such as the presence of sidewalks, parks or other green spaces – can directly influence a child’s ability to engage in physical activity, and in turn, affect their risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes,” said Lea Sacca, Ph.D., senior author and an assistant professor of population health in the Schmidt College of Medicine. Caregivers also increasingly reported neighborhood issues like litter and vandalism. These environmental concerns grew steadily between 2016 and 2020 and were evident across both the overall sample and the youngest age group. Other notable associations emerged in early childhood include receiving help from neighbors in 2016 and neighborhood walkability in 2019. Study findings also showed that in 2017, access to free or reduced-cost meals showed a similar link to neighborhood and household characteristics. From 2019 to 2020, there was a marked increase in the use of government assistance programs such as food stamps, free meal plans and cash support. While these programs may help address food insecurity, their impact on nutrition quality is more complicated. Participation in programs like SNAP and school meals has been linked to increased intake of processed, energy-dense foods high in sugar and fat, which may contribute to the risk of T2D. “While this finding could suggest improved access to food, previous research shows that relying on food assistance doesn’t always equate to better nutrition,” said Sacca. “For instance, children in food-insecure households tend to have poorer blood sugar control and higher hospitalization rates. Some research even suggests that participants in programs like SNAP may have worse diet quality than non-participants from similarly low-income households.” The researchers say effective T2D prevention and early detection efforts must consider both environmental factors and food quality – particularly neighborhood design and access to nutritious options – for lasting and widespread impact. Nonetheless, obesity remains the strongest and most common risk factor for TD2 in children. Children who are significantly overweight are four times more likely to develop the disease by age 25 than those with a healthy weight. “With obesity rates continuing to rise, especially among young children, prevention efforts are critical,” said Sacca. One particularly urgent target is reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, which are closely linked to both obesity and diabetes risk. Notably, nearly 70% of children aged 2 to 5 consume sugar-sweetened beverages daily. While some school-based policies like vending machine restrictions and small beverage taxes have led to slight decreases in consumption on school grounds, overall intake remains high. The researchers suggest that more assertive policies, including full bans in schools and larger taxes, may be needed. At the same time, evidence from successful school-based programs shows that improving dietary habits and increasing physical activity among children is achievable with the right support. “The rise in early-onset type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern,” said Sacca. “Addressing it requires a comprehensive strategy. That includes improving access to nutritious foods, creating healthier neighborhood environments, and investing in policies that promote long-term wellness from the very start of life.” Study co-authors are FAU medical students Ayden Dunn, Paige Brinzo, Sahar Kaleem, Austin Lent, Madison Etzel, Jennifer Mendonca, Vama Jhumkhawala and Milad Khoury, M.D., a clinical affiliate assistant professor of endocrinology in FAU’s Department of Medicine.

"FAU's Queen Conch Lab Receives Prestigious International Award","Megan Davis, Ph.D., (left) and Becky Holt, assistant director of the Queen Conch Lab, receiving the award during the Responsible Seafood Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia. Award Snapshot: FAU Harbor Branch researchers have received the prestigious 2025 Responsible Seafood Innovation Award in Aquaculture from the Global Seafood Alliance for its Queen Conch Lab’s pioneering work in sustainable aquaculture. Led by Megan Davis, Ph.D., the research team has developed mobile lab hatcheries – trailer-based systems that support queen conch restoration in Caribbean communities lacking traditional infrastructure. These mobile hatcheries help rebuild wild conch populations while creating local opportunities in education, employment, and food security. FAU was recognized for its innovative, community-focused approach, which blends science, sustainability, and cultural preservation to address the urgent decline of a species vital to the region’s ecosystems and economies. The Florida Atlantic University Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute’s Queen Conch Lab, led by research professor Megan Davis, Ph.D., has been named the recipient of the 2025 Responsible Seafood Innovation Award in Aquaculture from the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA). The award honors the Queen Conch Lab’s development of mobile lab hatcheries designed to help restore the threatened Caribbean queen conch. These self-contained, trailer-based hatcheries bring advanced aquaculture capabilities to coastal communities across the Caribbean, many of which lack traditional infrastructure. This innovation is not only helping to rebuild wild conch populations but is also generating opportunities in education, employment and food security throughout the region. GSA is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing responsible seafood practices through education, advocacy and third-party certification. GSA works across the seafood supply chain – from aquaculture to wild fisheries – to promote environmental responsibility, social accountability, food safety and animal welfare. Through its standards, events and media platforms, the organization helps ensure that seafood is produced in ways that are sustainable and ethically managed. This prestigious award was recently presented to Davis and Becky Holt, assistant director of the Queen Conch Lab, during the Responsible Seafood Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia, and recognizes transformative efforts in sustainable aquaculture that contribute to the future of responsible seafood production globally. The queen conch is a culturally and economically vital species that has long sustained Caribbean communities through its role in nutrition, trade and tradition. However, due to decades of overfishing and habitat loss, the species has seen significant declines. In 2024, NOAA listed the queen conch as ‘threatened’ under the Endangered Species Act. Current data suggests that commercial fishing in The Bahamas could become unsustainable within the next 10 to 15 years. Recognizing the urgency of this crisis, FAU’s Queen Conch Lab set out to pioneer a scalable, science-based solution that integrates restoration, education and community engagement. At the heart of this solution is the mobile lab hatchery – a laboratory built inside a custom trailer, similar in size to a food truck, outfitted with advanced aquaculture systems including solar power, aeration, flow-through and recirculating saltwater systems, and algae and conch cultivation setups. These units are designed to be transported to remote areas and connected directly to local seawater sources, making them fully operational hatcheries that require no permanent facilities. Since the first trailer was deployed to Great Exuma, The Bahamas in 2022, eight additional hatcheries have been launched in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, The Bahamas and Florida, with more in development for deployment to other nations including Turks and Caicos and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. These mobile hatcheries are capable of producing up to 2,000 juvenile queen conch annually, supporting both ecosystem restoration and sustainable seafood initiatives. However, their impact goes far beyond biological output. Each hatchery becomes a local hub for science education, job training and community empowerment. Through close partnerships with local organizations such as Blue Action Lab in Grand Bahama, Conservación ConCiencia and Villa Pesquera de Naguabo in Puerto Rico, University of West Indies in Jamaica, and other grassroots conservation and fishing groups – the Queen Conch Lab model ensures that local expertise and cultural knowledge are integrated into every stage of the process. “This recognition from the Global Seafood Alliance is an incredible milestone for our team and our many community partners,” said Davis. “It reflects the idea that science can be mobile, accessible and rooted in local collaboration. What started as a simple concept – putting a hatchery in a trailer – has become a powerful tool for helping to restore queen conch and supporting the culture, food security, seagrass ecosystems and identity of Caribbean communities.” The GSA’s Responsible Seafood Innovation Award highlights innovations that not only address pressing environmental challenges but also serve as catalysts for broader change in how seafood is produced, consumed and valued. “The work coming out of our Queen Conch Lab is extraordinary – not just in its scientific merit, but in its human impact,” said James Sullivan, Ph.D., executive director of FAU Harbor Branch. “The mobile hatcheries represent a new paradigm in aquaculture – bringing the lab to the people, training the next generation of marine scientists, and building resilience in ecosystems and economies alike. This is exactly the kind of bold, collaborative and community-driven work that sustainable seafood needs right now. It’s setting a global standard for what responsible aquaculture can and should look like.” Looking ahead, the Queen Conch Lab continues to pursue its long-term goal of establishing a community-based queen conch farm in every Caribbean country. The lab is also expanding its training programs, educational outreach, and scientific research in collaboration with a growing network of local and international partners. “As Caribbean nations confront the dual challenges of environmental degradation and economic vulnerability, our Queen Conch Lab offers a hopeful, actionable model for restoration and resilience,” said Davis.

"After Cancer: Study Explores Caring-Healing Modalities for Survivors","Healing doesn’t end with treatment. As cancer survivorship grows, many continue to struggle with anxiety and depression – often in silence. Study Snapshot: Healing doesn’t end with treatment. As cancer survivorship rates continue to rise, about 30% of people living with or beyond cancer experience lasting emotional challenges such as anxiety and depression. New research underscores the importance of supporting the emotional and psychological well-being of cancer survivors – not just their physical health. Researchers from the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing conducted the first-ever scoping review focused on caring-healing modalities (CHMs), including mindfulness, peer support, and expressive therapies, which help reduce emotional distress and strengthen resilience. The review examined 16 global studies and found that CHMs – delivered in settings from hospitals to homes – created healing environments that nurtured emotional expression, empathy, and human connection. Group-based interventions, in particular, were powerful in helping survivors process fear, rebuild inner strength, and reduce feelings of isolation. While most studies focused on breast cancer, researchers emphasize the need to expand this work across other cancer types. Ultimately, the findings call for a more holistic approach to survivorship care – one that treats patients as whole people and integrates science with compassion. As cancer survivorship rises, many people living with or beyond cancer face lasting physical and emotional challenges – particularly anxiety and depression, which affect about 30% of this population. Emotional distress is often unspoken, leading to fear, despair, and diminished quality of life. Growing research highlights resilience – the ability to recover from adversity – is a key factor in helping individuals manage distress and improve well-being. This underscores the urgent need for health care providers to adopt a whole-person approach that supports not just the body, but also the emotional and psychological needs of people with cancer. As Breast Cancer Awareness Month highlights the importance of survivorship, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing have completed the first scoping review focused on caring-healing modalities (CHMs) designed to boost resilience and reduce emotional distress such as depression and anxiety in people with cancer. Results, published in the journal Nursing Reports, help to shift attention from treatment to healing by exploring how CHMs such as mindfulness, peer support and expressive therapies can reduce emotional distress and build resilience in people with cancer. Notably, the majority of the included studies in this review focused on breast cancer survivors, highlighting the pressing need to address their emotional and spiritual well-being long after treatment ends. “Our findings highlight something too often overlooked in survivorship care: healing doesn’t end when treatment does,” said Judyta Kociolek, corresponding author and director of the FAU Clinical Research Unit, and an oncology nurse prior to starting a career in research. “What patients often need most is to be seen, heard and treated as whole human beings, so they can feel empowered in their recovery and cancer journey. These caring-based practices help them reclaim that sense of self.” Driven by Watson’s Theory of Human Caring, the review analyzed 16 global studies – including randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews – on CHMs delivered in hospitals, outpatient clinics and at home. The interventions varied widely, from mindfulness-based programs and therapeutic group discussions to expressive writing and psychoeducation. What these diverse approaches had in common were deeply human elements: shared emotional expression, empathetic listening, and a healing environment. CHMs created safe, quiet spaces where individuals could process fear, grief, hope and transformation – together or on their own. “This kind of healing environment isn’t just about peace and quiet – it’s a form of caring in action,” said Rita Gengo, Ph.D., co-author and an assistant professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “When you reduce noise, create privacy and invite calm, you allow people to breathe, reflect and begin to mend emotionally. The setting itself becomes part of the therapy.” The review found that group-based interventions were especially powerful. Whether in person or online, these sessions created supportive spaces where survivors could share their stories, reduce feelings of isolation, and discover inner strength. Many CHMs reflected principles similar to those in Watson’s Caritas Processes – such as authentic presence, building trust, and fostering care-centered teaching – a connection noted by the researchers. Watson’s Caritas Processes are a set of guiding principles in nursing that emphasize caring for the whole person – mind, body and spirit. They focus on compassion, deep human connection, and treating patients with dignity, empathy and respect. These processes encourage nurses to be fully present, build trusting relationships, and support healing beyond just physical care. “Caring-healing modalities grounded in human connection offer something profoundly transformative,” said Lenny Chiang-Hanisko, Ph.D., co-author and an associate professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “Through caring partnerships, people can access a deeper sense of self, expand their emotional capacity, and awaken their innate ability to heal.” Several studies in the review incorporated mindfulness-based techniques such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Mindful Self-Compassion, and Attention and Interpretation Therapy, which encouraged individuals to be present, breathe, and acknowledge both positive and negative emotions without judgment. These programs helped participants cultivate resilience and self-compassion, while also reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Importantly, CHMs were delivered in a variety of formats – face-to-face, online or through a hybrid approach – making them accessible and adaptable across different care settings. Some were brief, lasting 20 to 30 minutes, while others extended over months, allowing for deeper transformation. The review found that both short and long-term CHMs had clinical value, with longer programs more closely aligned with Watson’s emphasis on sustained caring-healing relationships. While the review focused primarily on resilience and emotional distress, many studies also reported improvements in quality of life, self-compassion, physical symptoms like fatigue, insomnia and pain, and even biomarkers related to stress. By integrating subjective experiences with objective data, CHMs pave the way toward precision nursing that honors both science and soul. “By bringing together personal experience and biological insight, we’re creating a future where care is deeply individualized,” said Kociolek. “It’s a vision of nursing that’s both scientifically rigorous and profoundly human.” This review also identifies important gaps and opportunities. Research on CHMs is still limited for other cancers, such as prostate or colorectal cancer, and funding for complementary therapies remains a barrier. The researchers call for expanded testing, greater reimbursement, and the inclusion of CHMs in standard survivorship care.

"FAU Researchers 'Zoom' in for an Ultra-Magnified Peek at Shark Skin","A bonnethead shark – the pint-sized cousin of hammerhead sharks. STUDY SNAPSHOT: What gives shark skin its unique toughness and smooth, hydrodynamic edge? The secret lies in dermal denticles – tiny, tooth-like scales made of the same material as our teeth. These microscopic armor plates don’t just make sharks sleek swimmers; they also shield their bodies from damage. But how do these denticles change as sharks grow – and do male and female sharks have different designs? Researchers dove deep into these questions by studying bonnethead sharks, close relatives of hammerheads. Using electron microscopy, they captured incredibly detailed images of the sharks’ skin, analyzing how denticle shape, size, and texture evolve across different life stages. Their findings revealed that as sharks mature, their denticles develop more ridges and change in orientation – enhancements that likely improve swimming efficiency and protection. Interestingly, while researchers expected major differences between the sexes, they found only one: males had slightly steeper ridge angles. This research not only sheds light on how sharks are built for survival and reproduction but could also inspire future innovations in swimwear and biomimetic design. Have you ever wondered what makes shark skin so tough and sleek? It’s dermal denticles – tiny, tooth-like structures that cover a shark’s skin. Made of the same material as teeth and shaped like small scales with grooves, these microscopic armor plates aren’t just for show. Dermal denticles serve important roles in helping sharks glide effortlessly, and protect their skin, especially during mating. Although much is known, researchers still lack a full understanding of how dermal denticle shape changes across different parts of the shark’s body as it grows and if there are differences between males and females. To solve this mystery, researchers from Florida Atlantic University turned to high-resolution imaging to examine bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) – the pint-sized cousins of hammerhead sharks. Using advanced scanning electron microscopy, they were able to capture detailed images of the sharks’ skin, focusing on minute features like denticle shape, size and ridge patterns – details far too small to be seen with standard microscopes. The team studied skin samples from 24 bonnethead sharks across various life stages. These sharks were an ideal subject, as their skin denticles undergo noticeable changes as they grow and show distinct features between males and females, especially in areas linked to mating. Findings, published in the journal Integrative and Comparative Biology, provide an ultra-magnified peek into the hidden world of shark skin, revealing how evolution fine-tunes this natural armor for survival and reproduction. Results of the study showed that denticle morphology changes significantly as bonnethead sharks mature, supporting the idea that these changes improve swimming efficiency and skin protection. Younger sharks had fewer ridges on the denticles, less overlap between them, and smaller ridge angles compared to older sharks. However, the overall length of the denticles stayed about the same at all stages. These changes likely help sharks swim better and protect their skin as they mature. “Shark skin is far more dynamic than people realize,” said Marianne E. Porter, Ph.D., senior author and an associate professor of biological sciences in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Our study shows that as bonnethead sharks grow, their skin doesn’t just get bigger – it transforms in ways that improve swimming performance and provide greater protection. These changes help reduce drag in the water and strengthen the skin against physical challenges like predators or mating-related injuries. It’s a remarkable example of how nature fine-tunes biological structures to meet the changing demands of an animal’s life.” Although previous studies found that female sharks often have thicker, tougher skin with higher denticle density – possibly to protect against male bites during mating – this study found minimal differences between the sexes. The only denticle trait that showed sexual dimorphism was ridge angle, which was slightly larger in males. There were also no significant differences in denticle features across the dorsal, medial and ventral parts of the abdominal region studied. “This research is relevant because gaining an understanding of the developmental aspects of a shark’s dermal denticles can provide extraordinary insights into their evolutionary role in facilitating survival locomotion and reproductive materials,” said Hannah Epstein, corresponding author, a recent graduate of FAU High School and a current student in FAU’s Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College. “We can also apply these quantifications of shark skin to other fields, such as bioengineering, to specifically design materials that can help someone swim faster, just as denticles help a shark swim faster.” The patterns observed in this study mirrors findings in other species, such as Portuguese dogfish sharks, which have 11 different denticle shapes that appear at different developmental stages. Past research has also shown that juveniles tend to have smaller denticles than adults, a trend that held true for bonnethead sharks in this study. “The advanced imaging and analysis tools we have at the Marcus Research and Innovation Center were essential for this research,” said Tricia Meredith, Ph.D., co-author, director of research for Florida Atlantic Laboratory Schools, and an assistant research professor in FAU’s College of Education. “Using scanning electron microscopy and precise morphometric software allowed us to see and measure the tiny details of shark denticles like never before. This technology opens up new possibilities to understand how these structures function and evolve, giving us a clearer picture of shark biology and biomechanics.” The Berlin Family Bioimaging Lab is a one-of-a-kind research laboratory that provides students access to high-tech equipment to work on complex research projects, including cancer treatment research, vaccine development, and prosthetic creation, among others. Students like Epstein can research some of the world’s most challenging problems at an early age and can share that research and publish it in peer-reviewed journals. The lab includes a micro computed tomography scanner; scanning electron microscope; histology suite; inverted compound microscope; and stereoscope and is available to researchers of all levels at FAU. Study co-author is Madeleine E. Hagood, a Ph.D. student of integrative biology at FAU.

"FAU Lands $3M Federal Grant to Prevent Substance Use in At-risk Youth","The five-year project will strengthen substance use prevention among more than 3,000 South Florida youth. Florida Atlantic University has received a $3 million, five-year grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, to lead a transformative community initiative designed to prevent substance use among South Florida’s youth. The new program, “Rising Strong: Empowering Youth for Substance-Free Futures,” will implement evidence-based, trauma-informed prevention strategies to reach more than 3,000 youth across Palm Beach and Broward counties over the next five years. The initiative is spearheaded by Maria Carmenza Mejia, M.D., principal investigator and a professor of population health in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with co-investigators Lea Sacca, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Population Health, Schmidt College of Medicine, and Brian Graves, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Phyllis and Harvey Sandler School of Social Work within FAU’s College of Social Work and Criminal Justice. The Rising Strong initiative is not only timely – it is profoundly necessary, as South Florida’s youth navigate the effects of increasing social, economic and mental health stressors, with substance use often emerging as a coping response. This program directly targets youth who are especially at risk, including those transitioning out of foster care, experiencing housing instability, residing in rural communities such as the Glades, and those who are survivors of human trafficking. School-age youth and young adults in need of behavioral health support will also be a central focus. A cornerstone of the initiative is FAU’s partnership with the FLITE Center, a Fort Lauderdale-based nonprofit that currently serves more than 2,000 youth aging out of foster care, chronically homeless youth, and other vulnerable youth. FLITE Center is Broward County’s one-stop resource center offering all supportive services. “We’re in the midst of a growing mental and behavioral health crisis among young people, particularly those navigating trauma, housing instability, or limited access to consistent care and support,” said Mejia. “This award gives us the opportunity to respond with evidence-based strategies, deep empathy, and strong community partnerships. Rising Strong isn’t just a program – it’s a commitment to every young person that their future matters, their voice counts, and that they deserve a life free from substance use and filled with possibilities.” Through Rising Strong, South Florida youth will gain access to a suite of integrated, evidence-based services, including LifeSkills Training to build decision-making and interpersonal abilities, mindfulness and emotional regulation programming to support trauma recovery, peer mentorship opportunities to foster connection and resilience, and SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment), which offers targeted support for those identified as at risk for substance use. These services will be delivered through schools, community centers and existing behavioral health networks, ensuring broad accessibility and minimal barriers to entry. “This grant represents the best of what we strive for at Florida Atlantic University – collaboration, impact and transformation,” said Lewis S. Nelson, M.D., dean and chief of health affairs, Schmidt College of Medicine. “When academic expertise joins forces with community leadership, we can reach young people where they are and give them the tools to rewrite their stories. This initiative is a testament to what’s possible when we invest in prevention, listen to our youth, and build systems of care that reflect their lived realities. For families, schools and communities across South Florida, Rising Strong will be a beacon of hope.” Beyond service delivery, the initiative aims to drive long-term systems change. Within its first six months, the project will conduct a comprehensive regional needs assessment and convene a multi-sector prevention coalition to inform implementation. Each year, at least 30 professionals will be trained in trauma-informed and culturally responsive prevention strategies, building the community’s collective capacity to respond to youth needs. Over five years, the program will train 150 professionals and directly serve 600 youth annually. “Social work brings a systems lens to prevention by connecting people, policies and practices to create lasting change,” said Naelys Luna, Ph.D., dean of the College of Social Work and Criminal Justice. “Rising Strong will not only provide direct services to youth, but also build a stronger, more responsive network of care across South Florida. By training professionals, engaging communities and addressing root causes, this initiative reflects the core values of our field. We are excited to participate in this important endeavor and collaborate with partners dedicated to creating meaningful opportunities for our youth and our communities.” FAU’s leadership in behavioral health and community-based research provides a strong foundation for the initiative. The Schmidt College of Medicine and the College of Social Work and Criminal Justice are nationally recognized for their contributions to trauma-informed care, health equity, and systems-level interventions. The collaboration with FLITE Center exemplifies FAU’s commitment to working hand-in-hand with community partners to address the root causes of public health challenges. The program will continue through Sept. 29, 2030. “As Rising Strong grows, it has the potential to become a national model for youth substance use prevention that centers community voices, respects lived experience and champions the resilience of young people,” said Mejia.

"World's First Bench-to-Bedside MRI, Focused Ultrasound System Unveiled","(Photo by Alex Dolce) In a global first, Florida Atlantic University has unveiled an unprecedented research initiative uniting advanced MRI and focused ultrasound technologies into a single, preclinical and clinical research platform that promises to accelerate the pathway from scientific discovery to patient care. This state-of-the-art initiative at the Florida Atlantic NeuroInnovate Center empowers scientists to explore the brain and body with exceptional precision, advancing the understanding of complex neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and more. Integrating a comprehensive “bench-to-bedside” approach, the initiative will significantly accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new treatments, ultimately transforming patient care. “Never before has a single institution integrated preclinical and clinical imaging with focused ultrasound capabilities within one comprehensive, unified research environment,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “This is far more than just a milestone for Florida Atlantic University. This groundbreaking initiative positions our region and state at the forefront of innovation in research, education and health care delivery. We are excited to lead the way in bringing revolutionary research and technologies to the frontlines of medicine.” Researchers will now have access to a fully integrated system that allows them to study disease mechanisms, test treatments in real time, and apply those therapies directly to patients. It begins with the preclinical MRI, designed for research using translational models. Once a treatment shows promise, it can move seamlessly to human trials using the clinical MRI system that guides and monitors therapies in a safe, controlled setting. “These machines are more than just high-tech – they represent some of the most advanced tools available to modern science and medicine,” said Gregg Fields, Ph.D., vice president for research at FAU. “What we’ve built is a truly integrated research platform – one that enables us to examine everything from molecular changes in clinical models to real-time treatment responses in human patients. The impact this will have on fast-tracking discoveries across disciplines is hard to overstate. This is not just the next step in medical innovation – it’s the future, and it’s happening right here at Florida Atlantic University.” Focused ultrasound uses precise acoustic energy, like sunlight through a magnifying glass, to target tissues safely. Multiple beams converge at one point, producing mechanical or thermal effects. This non-invasive, rapidly advancing therapy has growing clinical uses in a wide range of diseases including neurological disorders, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and pain management. Through strategic partnerships with Delray Medical Center, Boca Raton Regional Hospital – part of Baptist Health – and the Thomas H. Corey VA Medical Center, FAU researchers and physicians will leverage the Florida Atlantic NeuroInnovate Center to tackle a range of neurological conditions. This initiative builds on Florida Atlantic’s 2023 collaboration with Insightec and Delray Medical Center, which introduced focused ultrasound into the clinical setting to treat patients with movement and cognitive disorders. “As a neurosurgeon, I’m truly excited about the potential of this integrated system at Florida Atlantic to elevate patient care,” said Lloyd Zucker, M.D., medical director of neurosurgery at Palm Beach Health Network and a clinical research professor at Florida Atlantic. “The precision and noninvasive capabilities of technologies like focused ultrasound are revolutionizing how we approach neurological diseases. We’re not just imagining the future of medicine – we’re making it happen.” “This level of imaging and intervention opens the door to understanding and treating brain disorders in ways that were unimaginable even a decade ago,” said Michael Dobbs, M.D., chair of the Clinical Neurosciences Department and the inaugural FairfaxWood Chair of Clinical Neurosciences in the FAU Schmidt College of Medicine. “We can assess brain structure, monitor real-time blood flow, and track treatment effects – all with extraordinary precision. The implications for disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are profound.” “This pioneering system will also serve as a cornerstone for educating the next generation of physicians, scientists and biomedical engineers,” said Lewis S. Nelson, M.D., dean of the Schmidt College of Medicine. “By offering an immersive, hands-on learning environment, it will empower future health professionals to lead with innovation and shape the future of medicine.” The new platform continues the ongoing expansion of Florida Atlantic University’s academic and research mission. Designed to reshape the way clinicians and researchers treat, understand and study complex brain diseases, this unique system integrates multiple technologies to provide unmatched diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. The Florida Atlantic NeuroInnovate Center includes the SIGNA™ Premier 3.0T MRI from GE Healthcare, the NordicNeuroLab fMRI System for functional neuroimaging, and the BioSpec Maxwell 70/17 and 94/17 preclinical MRI systems. The addition of a low-frequency focused ultrasound unit (Insightec Prime 220 V3) creates a unified environment that supports everything from preclinical investigations to FDA-regulated clinical trials and patient care.

"Beyond the Pink Ribbon: Combating Breast Cancer in Younger Women","About 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in the U.S. this year and about 42,170 will die from breast cancer. As National Breast Cancer Awareness Month gets underway, research from Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing is bringing attention to a concerning public health issue – early-onset breast cancer and the rising rates of breast cancer among women diagnosed under age 50. Led by Tarsha Jones, RN, Ph.D., principal investigator and an associate professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, the research focuses on young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) and highlights the critical importance of genetic testing, risk-reduction, and family risk communication. Supported by a multi-year grant from the National Institutes of Health, her study deepens the understanding of how younger women experience breast cancer and the unique challenges faced by this population. Jones’ work is part of a growing call in the medical community to investigate why more women are being diagnosed younger, and how to provide equitable, evidence-based support – particularly as research suggests genetics only explain part of the picture. The research team conducted a cross-sectional study and surveyed 97 YBCS, all diagnosed under age 50, recruited from comprehensive cancer centers in New York and Florida. Additional women were also recruited through community-based organizations. Key participant characteristics include: These insights underscore the need for greater awareness of early warning signs and proactive risk management. While mammograms remain a crucial screening tool, self-awareness and timely action can be lifesaving. “Our data shows that genetics – such as pathogenic mutations or variants – is only part of the big picture. We found that while most women, 93%, completed genetic testing, the majority, 76.1%, had negative test results,” said Jones. “We recognize that there are multiple determinants of health at play, and more research is needed to investigate the complex interaction between biological, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental exposures in order to reduce cancer health disparities and improve health outcomes for all women.” Four women who were diagnosed at a young age and participated in the study courageously share their stories, as a reminder that breast cancer doesn’t come with an age limit. They are participating in a digital storytelling project, which highlights the human side of cancer and offers the unique perspectives of YBCS to educate, inspire and bring hope to other women. With support from an NIH Mentored Research Scientist Award, interprofessional collaborations and a mentoring team, Jones is refining and evaluating a multi-component digital storytelling intervention tailored to the educational, clinical and psychosocial needs of YBCS. Breast Cancer Awareness: What Can You Do? “At FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, a caring science approach grounds everything we do – including breast cancer research. This philosophy transforms data into dignity, recognizing that behind every statistic is a whole person whose well-being is nurtured through presence, compassion and meaningful connection,” said Cameron Duncan, Ph.D., DNP, the Holli Rockwell Trubinsky Eminent Dean of Nursing in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “This research is a vital step forward in understanding and addressing the unique challenges young women with breast cancer face. By shedding light on these early diagnoses, we strive to inspire hope, drive prevention and ultimately save lives.” About 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in the United States this year and about 42,170 will die from breast cancer. “Women under 50, represent 16% of the total invasive breast cancer cases, according to the American Cancer Society,” said Jones. “Younger women with breast cancer have profoundly different experiences, complex challenges and are more likely to die of the disease compared to older women with the disease, emphasizing the critical importance of ongoing support for women’s health research.” The individual stories were shared with permission from the survivors.

"Study: 'Man's Best Friend' Slows Cellular Aging in Female Veterans","The study focused on U.S. female veterans and is among the first to examine the impact of working with service dogs in this population. (Photo by Alex Dolce) New research finds that “man’s best friend” may help slow biological aging in women. This groundbreaking study, focused on female veterans in the United States, is among the first to examine the impact of working with service dogs on this often-overlooked population. By measuring biological indicators of stress, the researchers have uncovered a key insight: the way stress is felt emotionally doesn’t always reflect how it affects the body at a cellular level. While women have served in the U.S. military for generations, their roles have expanded dramatically since 1948. Yet despite their growing presence and unique experiences, most military studies still center on men – even as women report higher rates of PTSD. Building on the need for focused research, Florida Atlantic University researchers, in collaboration with the University of Maryland School of Nursing, the Medical College of Georgia, and Warrior Canine Connection, Inc., conducted the study involving female veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. But instead of receiving service dogs, these women volunteered to train them for fellow veterans in need – offering support not just to others, but potentially to themselves. The study, supported by the National Institutes of Health’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development, examined whether this purposeful, mission-driven activity could reduce both biological and psychological stress, and whether previous combat exposure influenced those effects. Until now, the emotional and therapeutic benefits of such unique relationships have been largely unexamined in female veterans. To measure biological stress, researchers looked at telomere length (a marker of cellular aging) using saliva samples, and heart rate variability (HRV), a sign of nervous system balance, using wearable monitors in participants in the service dog training program group or a comparison group that watched dog training videos. Psychological stress was assessed using validated questionnaires measuring PTSD symptoms, perceived stress, and anxiety at multiple points during the study. Results, published in the journal Behavioral Sciences, revealed promising biological benefits associated with service dog training – particularly for veterans with combat experience – while improvements in psychological symptoms were seen across all participants, regardless of the intervention. One of the most striking findings involved telomere length. Veterans who participated in the dog-training program showed an increase in telomere length, suggesting a slowing of cellular aging. In contrast, those in the control group exhibited a decrease in telomere length, indicating accelerated aging. Combat experience significantly influenced these results: veterans with combat exposure who trained service dogs experienced the greatest gains in telomere length, whereas those with combat exposure in the control group saw the most pronounced declines. On the psychological front, both groups – those who trained dogs and those in the control group – reported significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, anxiety and perceived stress over the eight-week period. However, these mental health improvements were similar across groups, suggesting that simply participating in the study and receiving structured attention may have offered therapeutic value. Unlike the biological findings, psychological outcomes did not appear to be affected by combat exposure. “Female veterans face unique reintegration challenges that are often overlooked, and traditional PTSD treatments don’t always meet their needs,” said Cheryl Krause-Parello, Ph.D., first author, associate vice president for FAU research, associate executive director, FAU I-Health, and director of C-PAWW™. “Nontraditional approaches like connecting with animals can offer meaningful support. These relationships provide emotional safety and stability, which can be especially powerful for women. But not all veterans can care for a service animal, so animal-related volunteerism may offer similar healing benefits without the burden of ownership.” The study also suggests that the skills learned during service dog training – such as positive reinforcement and reading animal behavior – may have strengthened participants’ bonds with their own pets at home, offering additional emotional support. Unlike general volunteering, service dog training uniquely blends emotional healing with building a close relationship between veterans and their animals, providing therapeutic benefits that go beyond typical community engagement. “This research underscores the power of service dog training as a meaningful, non-pharmacological intervention to support the health and healing of female veterans with PTSD,” said Krause-Parello. “It opens the door to more personalized approaches that nurture both the mind and body.” Female veterans aged 32 to 72 were randomly assigned to either the service dog training program group or a comparison group that watched dog training videos. Both groups took part in one-hour sessions each week for eight weeks. Researchers measured outcomes before, during and after the program. These findings provide early evidence that non-pharmacological interventions – such as service dog training – may help reduce the physical toll of stress and slow cellular aging in female veterans.

"Chatbots the New 'Doc?' Exploring AI in Health Behavior Coaching","Advances in artificial intelligence are opening new possibilities to bring motivational interviewing to more people through digital tools. Changing health habits – like quitting smoking, exercising more, or sticking to prescribed treatments – is difficult but crucial for preventing and managing chronic diseases. Motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered counseling method that helps people find their own motivation to change, has proven effective across many health care settings. Yet despite strong evidence, MI is not widely used in clinical practice due to challenges like limited time, training demands and payment barriers. Advances in artificial intelligence, however, are opening new possibilities to bring MI to more people through digital tools. AI-powered chatbots, apps and virtual agents can simulate the supportive, empathetic conversations at the heart of MI. Using approaches ranging from scripted dialogues to advanced large language models like GPT-4 (commonly known as ChatGPT), these tools provide around-the-clock, judgment-free support. They may be especially helpful for people who do not seek traditional behavioral health care. Early studies suggest these AI tools are feasible and acceptable, but it remains unclear how closely they follow core MI principles such as empathy and promoting autonomy, and whether they effectively change behaviors. Evaluating this “MI fidelity” is challenging, as traditional methods need detailed human review and don’t scale well. To fill these important knowledge gaps, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine conducted the first scoping review of studies on AI-driven systems designed to deliver motivational interviewing. They focused on exploring how AI tools such as chatbots and large language models are being used to deliver MI, what is known about their usability and acceptability, the extent to which these systems adhere to core MI principles, and the behavioral or psychological outcomes reported so far. Results, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, reveal that the most used AI tools were chatbots, with some virtual agents and mobile apps, using technologies ranging from rule-based systems to advanced models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. While all aimed to simulate motivational interviewing, the quality and rigor of their evaluations varied. Only a few studies addressed safety concerns around AI-generated content, with most not detailing safeguards against misinformation or inappropriate responses. While only a few studies reported actual behavioral changes, most focused on important psychological factors like readiness to change and feeling understood. Importantly, no studies looked at long-term behavioral outcomes, and follow-up periods were often short or missing entirely. So, while AI tools can effectively deliver motivational content and influence early signs of change, their ability to create lasting behavior shifts remains unclear. “Many digital interventions included motivational ‘elements’ but didn’t clearly show if or how they follow formal MI practices,” said Maria Carmenza Mejia, M.D., senior author and a professor of population health, Schimdt College of Medicine. “We carefully mapped the specific techniques used – like open-ended questions, affirmations, and reflective listening – and looked at how fidelity was assessed, whether through expert review or study design. This level of detail is essential to understand what these AI tools are actually doing and how well they mirror true motivational interviewing.” Findings show that despite their strengths, limitations around emotional nuance and conversational depth were commonly noted. “Users appreciated the convenience and structure of AI systems but often missed the ‘human touch’ and complex relational dynamics of face-to-face counseling,” said Mejia. Participants in the studies varied widely from general adults to college students and patients with specific health conditions. Smoking cessation was the most common focus, followed by substance use reduction, stress management, and other health behaviors. “AI-driven systems show exciting potential to deliver motivational interviewing and support meaningful health behavior change,” said Mejia. “These tools are feasible and well-accepted across various health issues, demonstrating key principles like empathy and collaboration. However, few studies have rigorously evaluated their impact on behavior or fidelity. As AI health interventions evolve, future research must focus on robust evaluation, transparency and ethical responsibility. By blending scalable AI technology with proven behavioral frameworks, we can expand access and better support patients facing behavior change challenges.” Study co-authors are FAU medical students Zev Karve, Jacob Caley, Christopher Machado and Michelle K.

"FAU Joins Neuroarts Academic Network to Bridge Art, Brain and Healing","As a member of the Neuroarts Academic Network, FAU will amplify its ongoing efforts at the intersection of neuroscience, healing and the arts. Florida Atlantic University has joined the newly launched Neuroarts Academic Network (NAN), recently announced by the NeuroArts Blueprint Initiative. NAN is a global initiative aimed at expanding the transformative power of the arts – such as music, dance, painting and storytelling – by building the emerging interdisciplinary field of neuroarts and training the next generation of leaders. Building on research that demonstrates how art positively affects the brain and body, NAN will explore how creative expression can be embedded in mainstream medicine, public health and across society to improve health and well-being for all. FAU will help lead this groundbreaking global movement to harness the power of aesthetic experiences to enhance brain health and transform care across disciplines. FAU is one of only two universities in Florida – and one of more than 35 institutions worldwide – selected to join the network’s initial working group. “This is a significant step for Florida Atlantic University and for the emerging field of neuroarts,” said Randy Blakely, Ph.D., FAU designated official for NAN, executive director of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, the David J.S. Nicholson Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience, and a professor of biomedical science in the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine. “Building on the momentum of the NeuroArts Blueprint, joining NAN recognizes FAU for its commitment to programs to unite the arts with brain science and medicine. This commitment not only recognizes a growing movement but also opens a door to transformative research opportunities – particularly in understanding how aesthetic experience can impact brain health. We are proud to help shape a future where creativity and science work hand in hand to improve lives.” Blakely will lead the initiative in close collaboration with Nicole Baganz, Ph.D., director of community engagement and programming, FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, and academic collaborators across FAU and the broader community through the Program in Artistic Resilience, a key component of the soon to be launched FAU Center for the Resilient Mind. “The arts are not merely expressions of human experience – they are powerful tools for healing and neurobiological integration,” said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, who will partner with Blakely to develop the Program in Artistic Resilience. “Decades of research demonstrate that engaging with the arts stimulates complex brain networks involved in emotion, memory and cognition. By joining this interdisciplinary network, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing scientific inquiry into how the arts promote both individual healing and the well-being of communities.” The partnership with NAN is designed to amplify FAU’s ongoing efforts at the intersection of neuroscience, healing and the arts. One signature event in this activity will be the Insights VIII Exhibition, opening Feb. 20, 2026, at the FAU Ritter Art Gallery – a partnership with Horswell and Veronique Côté, Ph.D., director of FAU Galleries. The exhibit, part of the Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute’s annual Brainy Days celebration, features work generated by artists living with bipolar disorder, illuminating the role of creative expression in developing resilience, heightening public understanding, and combatting stigma. As part of the NAN effort, the institute is also set to launch a pilot grant program to support innovative research at the crossroads of neuroscience and the arts – jump-starting collaborative projects that explore how creative disciplines such as music, dance, theater and the visual arts can influence brain function and health and support emotional well-being. “At this formative stage, the generous seed funding from the Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute is critical to launching collaborative research in neuroarts,” said Michael R. Dobbs, M.D., the first endowed FairfaxWood Chair of Clinical Neurosciences, chair and professor of the Clinical Neurosciences Department and associate dean of clinical affairs in the Schmidt College of Medicine. “This support may prove truly transformative – advancing our understanding of how artistic expression can be harnessed to improve brain health, enhance therapeutic outcomes and open new frontiers in treatment.” The NeuroArts Blueprint Initiative, which launched the NAN, is co-led by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s International Arts + Mind Lab Center for Applied Neuroaesthetics and the Aspen Institute’s Health, Medicine & Society Program, with support from The Music Man Foundation. The initiative is co-directed by Susan Magsamen, executive director of the International Arts + Mind Lab at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Ruth J. Katz, executive director of the Health, Medicine & Society Program at the Aspen Institute. “Neuroarts is a vibrant, interdisciplinary field grounded in evidence-based knowledge and united by shared research principles, practices and values. To fully realize its potential, we must learn from one another, develop a common language, and build a collaborative framework that enables our disciplines to flourish individually while also working together to build the field,” said Magsamen. The network’s goal is to establish neuroarts as a rigorous academic and professional field that bridges arts, health, basic sciences, public policy and community engagement. “In these challenging times of rapid change, the Neuroarts Academic Network offers a bold, collaborative model to strengthen neuroarts education, workforce development and interdisciplinary impact,” said Katz. “It is essential to advancing this important and game-changing work.” The Insights VIII exhibit, presented in partnership with the Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation, will run from Feb. 20 to March 6, 2026, and will feature more than 40 works selected from more than 200 national submissions. According to Blakely, several artists whose work will be displayed in the exhibit will be in attendance across the span of the exhibit with hopes of sharing insights into their process and goals for artistic expression. “Our inclusion in the Neuroarts Academic Network reinforces our commitment to interdisciplinary innovation, public health impact, and the belief that science and the arts have much to inform the other along the road to human vitality,” said Blakely.
