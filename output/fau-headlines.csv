"FAU Lands EPA Grant to Use Genetics in Florida Bay Sponge Restoration","Andia Chaves-Fonnegra, Ph.D., principal investigator, conducting research in the field. Andia Chaves-Fonnegra, Ph.D., an associate professor of biology at Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, has been awarded a five-year, $720,446 grant from the United States EPA to support a pioneering project aimed at restoring sponge populations in Florida Bay through a genetics-based approach. Florida Bay is a shallow body of water between the southern tip of mainland Florida and the Florida Keys. It is part of Everglades National Park, which supports important marine life like sponges, fish and spiny lobster. The project marks the first genetic assessment of sponge restoration efforts in the region and seeks to build long-term ecological resilience in one of the nation’s most vulnerable marine environments. Sponges are a vital component of benthic, hard-bottom communities throughout Florida Bay and the Florida reef tract. These organisms perform essential ecological functions – filtering vast volumes of water, cycling nutrients such as nitrogen, stabilizing seafloor sediments, and providing habitat for a variety of marine species. Among the most economically important is the spiny lobster, which depends on sponge-rich environments as nursery grounds. Although we may not think of sponges as important or charismatic animals, they support a multi-million-dollar lobster fishery in South Florida. In addition, two of the sponge species in the study are commercial bath sponges, which, on their own, also supported the highly successful sponge fishery industry before the introduction of plastic sponges and the collapse of their populations. The degradation of sponge communities has had cascading impacts on both the sponge and lobster fisheries, as well as on the broader ecosystem services that sponges provide. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in restoring sponge populations through transplantation programs that use asexual cuttings. These efforts, spearheaded by a coalition of scientists, state agencies, and community partners, have helped to reestablish sponge cover in areas heavily impacted by disease, phytoplankton blooms, and cold-water events. However, because these transplants are clonal, they lack genetic diversity, limiting the resilience of restored populations to environmental stressors and reducing their capacity to adapt to shifts in weather patterns. Chaves-Fonnegra’s research will address this critical limitation by integrating population genetics into restoration strategies. Her team will analyze the genetic structure and diversity of four key sponge species currently used in Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) restoration programs: Spongia Barbara – a type of bath sponge known for its soft textures, Spongia graminea – referred to as the grass sponge, Ircinia campana – known as the vase sponge because of its shape, and Spheciospongia vesparium – commonly called the loggerhead sponge. Using advanced tools such as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms, the researchers will evaluate genetic diversity, inbreeding levels, clonality, and reproductive success in both nursery and outplant sites. This innovative project will also examine the degree to which restored sponges are reproducing sexually with wild populations and whether their offspring are genetically diverse enough to withstand the pressures of a warming ocean. “Receiving this EPA grant is incredibly significant because it means that we can move from simply rebuilding sponge numbers to restoring sponge populations with the genetic strength to withstand a shifting climate, disease, and other growing threats,” said Chaves-Fonnegra, principal investigator. “For the region, that means more stable fisheries, healthier reef ecosystems, clearer waters, and a safeguard for communities and businesses that depend on a thriving Florida Bay. It’s not just science – it’s an investment in resilience, for our ecosystems and for our people.” Florida’s coral reef ecosystems, which include reefs, hard-bottom habitats, and sponge communities, support more than $1 billion annually in tourism and recreational activities. Reef-related fishing generates more than $150 million in sales each year, and tens of thousands of jobs across the state depend on the health of these marine systems. As Florida’s coastal ecosystems face increasing threats, restoration efforts must evolve to ensure they are both effective and adaptive. Through this work, FAU is helping to shape the future of marine conservation in Florida, integrating science, policy, and innovation to protect one of the state’s most ecologically and economically valuable natural resources.

"Single Drug Shows Promise to Treat PTSD, Pain, and Alcohol Misuse","PTSD affects about 12 million U.S. adults, with veterans hit especially hard – and many also grappling with alcohol use disorder and chronic pain. These conditions often overlap and fuel each other, making treatment complex and largely ineffective. (Photo by Alex Dolce) About 12 million adults in the United States are affected by PTSD, impacting between 4% and 8% of the adult population – and up to 30% of military personnel and veterans. Strikingly, 63% of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and/or chronic pain. These conditions frequently overlap, with individuals who have AUD or chronic pain often also experiencing PTSD. When these disorders co-occur, they tend to worsen one another, making effective treatment significantly more challenging. Currently, no approved medications effectively treat PTSD and AUD together, and many available drugs come with serious side effects or limited results. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, conducted two complementary studies in rats to explore how a new drug, PPL-138, might help treat PTSD and its common companions – anxiety, chronic pain, and AUD. A type of opioid partial agonist, PPL-138 works by targeting specific opioid receptors in the brain. Intellectual property related to PPL-138 is owned by Phoenix PharmaLabs, Inc. The company is in the process of advancing PPL-138 through clinical trials. The first study, carried out at the University of Oklahoma, looked at whether long-term treatment with PPL-138 could reduce PTSD-related symptoms in chronic traumatic stress. The second study, conducted at FAU, focused on the relationship between trauma, anxiety and alcohol use, and researchers divided rats into different groups. Results, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, provide promising evidence that PPL-138 could become a valuable treatment for PTSD and alcohol misuse – particularly when symptoms are rooted in anxiety. By targeting a brain system involved in both stress and addiction, researchers believe PPL-138 may one day offer a much-needed breakthrough for those struggling with these life-altering conditions. Findings show that PPL-138 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior, pain responses, and alcohol consumption – but only in rats that developed PTSD-like symptoms. In both male and female rats, the drug selectively reduced alcohol use in those that also showed signs of trauma-related anxiety, without affecting those that were resilient or not stressed. “Our results show that PPL-138 not only reduces trauma-related anxiety and pain, but also selectively curbs alcohol use in rats most vulnerable to stress-induced drinking,” said Andrea Cippitelli, Ph.D., lead author and an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Science within the Schmidt College of Medicine and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute. “This kind of targeted treatment could transform how we manage PTSD and its comorbidities – especially for the large number of patients who currently fall through the cracks of existing therapies.” The study findings also emphasize the need to consider sex differences in both the causes and treatment of these overlapping conditions. Among female rats, PPL-138 reduced alcohol intake in those exhibiting anxiety, even if their drinking had not escalated. This indicates that anxiety alone may be a primary factor driving alcohol use in females. “Anxious male rats were twice as likely as females to increase their alcohol intake following trauma, while nearly all female rats with more alcohol intake also displayed clear signs of anxiety,” said Cippitelli. “This mirrors well-documented patterns in humans, where women are more prone to anxiety-related disorders like PTSD and often use alcohol to cope with emotional distress, whereas men typically engage in heavier, more generalized drinking.” Importantly, the effects of PPL-138 were not due to sedation or reduced activity. The compound did not alter movement or alcohol consumption in rats with anxiety-related behaviors or traumatic stress. In fact, movement levels remained unchanged in male rats and slightly increased in females – supporting the idea that the drug acts specifically on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, rather than causing general suppression or sedation. “This research represents a much-needed step toward helping both civilians and veterans living with the invisible wounds of trauma,” said Cippitelli. “In our preclinical studies, PPL-138 shows strong potential as a single therapy for the overlapping symptoms of PTSD, chronic pain, and alcohol misuse – offering a potentially safer and more effective alternative to current multi-drug approaches.” Study co-authors are Yong Zhang, Ph.D., University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy; Kyle Kealoha, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Ali Idriss, former research lab technician, FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Panini S.

"Logistics Industry Mixed as Smaller Firms Face Rising Costs","The logistics industry demonstrated mixed signals across its key indicators, as smaller firms try to hedge increasing costs, according to researchers from Florida Atlantic University and four other schools. The logistics industry demonstrated mixed signals across its key indicators, as smaller firms try to hedge increasing costs, according to researchers from Florida Atlantic University and four other schools. August’s reading came in at 59.3, a slight uptick from July’s 59.2, but far below the historical average of 61.5, according to the Logistics Managers Index. Any score above 50 indicates the industry is expanding; a score below 50 suggests contraction. Inventory levels (58.2) and Inventory costs (79.2) rose 2.7 and 7.3 points, respectively, as companies started stocking more goods and inventory became more expensive to hold, contributing to August’s slight increase. Drops in transportation levels and transportation prices contributed downward pressure to this month’s reading. “Given the fluctuating regulatory environment associated with tariff rates and import duties, it appears that firms are consuming more warehouse capacity, as this metric is approaching contraction, and the prices associated with warehousing are up,” said Steven Carnovale, Ph.D., associate professor of supply chain management in FAU’s College of Business. The LMI, a survey of director-level and above supply chain executives, measures the expansion or contraction of the logistics industry using eight unique components: inventory levels, inventory costs, warehousing capacity, warehousing utilization, warehousing prices, transportation capacity, transportation utilization and transportation prices. Along with FAU, researchers at Arizona State University, Colorado State University, Rutgers University, and the University of Nevada at Reno calculated the LMI using a diffusion index. Continuing the trend observed over the last four months, logistics expansion was being disproportionately driven by smaller firms (firms with less than 1,000 employees). Small firms reported an overall index of 62.7, higher than the 58.2 reading reported by larger firms (firms with more than 1,000 employees). “Typically, larger firms have higher buying power and can act more quickly and in larger volumes, such as bulk importing of goods ahead of any published tariff rate increases. We saw this activity in previous reports,” Carnovale said. “This month’s data show that smaller firms are responding to try to hedge cost increases, and this is reflected in their higher overall logistics activity.” The previous gap between upstream firms, or manufacturers and suppliers, and downstream firms, or retailers, disappeared in August, a trend researchers believe indicates better flow through the supply chain. Higher upstream activity with manufacturers and suppliers suggests that the rest of the supply chain will have more logistics activity as products are pushed downstream to retailers. “The shift to higher activity in the downstream suggests that supply chains might be showing stability, but the higher price indexes may result in increased prices to consumers in the coming months,” Carnovale said. “This, coupled with reports of decreased consumer sentiment and spending, needs to be monitored as we enter the forthcoming holiday season.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.","https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/logistics-industry-mixed-signals-smaller-firms-rising-costs.php"
