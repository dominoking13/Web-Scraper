"College of Nursing Receives $1.8M Gift from Mark Bruce Swillinger","Mark Bruce Swillinger has donated a $1.5 million gift to Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing in memory of his late wife, Marilyn Lee Swillinger, to establish an endowed professorship in hospice and palliative care nursing.

Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing has received a $1.5 million gift from Mark Bruce Swillinger in memory of his wife, Marilyn Lee Swillinger, to establish an endowed professorship in hospice and palliative care nursing. The Mark Bruce and Marilyn Lee Swillinger Endowed Professor will expose nursing students to specialized studies in hospice and palliative care throughout their nursing education. Additional gifts totaling $300,000 name the dean’s conference room for Marilyn Lee Swillinger, and the collaborative classroom for Mark and Marilyn together.

Marilyn Lee Swillinger, who passed away on Oct. 30, 2023, after a two-year battle with lung cancer, was especially passionate about supporting health care and the arts. She was a longtime member of the College of Nursing’s advisory board and supported other FAU colleges and departments, in addition to numerous other local charitable organizations.

“This is my opportunity to memorialize Marilyn and give back to the community, which has given so much to us,” said Mark Swillinger. “I can’t say enough about the treatment that hospice gave to Marilyn and me. It’s important not only to the people in need but also for everyone within our community.”

The Mark Bruce and Marilyn Lee Swillinger Endowed Professorship in Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing will provide support in perpetuity for a professor with expertise in hospice and palliative care who will direct the integration of this nursing specialty into the undergraduate curriculum that includes academics, simulation, clinical training, and preparation for certification in all levels in hospice and palliative care. This professor will also introduce students to this important specialty early in their academic careers and promote and prepare them for rewarding careers in hospice and palliative care.

“Our region faces critical shortages in nursing and health care, and this generous gift will have a lasting impact on the university and the communities we serve,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “Through their involvement and support over the years, Mark and Marilyn truly embraced Florida Atlantic as their hometown university. We are grateful that Mark chose to establish this meaningful legacy in memory of Marilyn in our College of Nursing.”

The need for hospice and palliative care is especially acute in Florida as more than 21% of state residents are age 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a number expected to grow to 27% by 2030. And the overall need for nurses continues to be crucial. FAU’s College of Nursing will be the first in the region to offer such a program focused on hospice and palliative care.

“As a member of the College of Nursing’s first advisory board, Marilyn had a profound influence on the college, helping it grow to what it is today,” said Cameron Duncan, Ph.D., DNP, Holli Rockwell Trubinsky Eminent Dean of Nursing. “Hospice and palliative care are so important to the community, and so many lives are going to be impacted because of Mark’s generosity.”

"FAU Kicks Off Construction of Wallach Building","From left, FAU President Adam Hasner; FAU benefactor Marilyn Wallach; Mark Wallach; and Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters at FAU, celebrate the start of construction of the Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Holocaust and Jewish Studies Building.

Florida Atlantic University celebrated the start of construction of its Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Holocaust and Jewish Studies Building. The 22,000-square-foot, two-story structure will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Holocaust education, Jewish studies and related programs. It also will become a South Florida destination for visitors seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust, including cultural performances, lectures and exhibits that further understanding and respect for humanity. Construction is expected to take approximately 14 months with a targeted opening of fall 2026.

“This is a monumental day, and I know Kurt would be so proud to see this building become a reality,” said Marilyn Wallach. Kurt Wallach died in 2021, a year after the couple made a transformational $20 million gift to FAU to create the Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Institute for Holocaust and Jewish Studies, with a portion used as the lead gift to construct the Wallach building.

“Kurt always said, “We speak for those who cannot speak, and we remember all the victims, including our family members who perished needlessly,” Marilyn Wallach said. “It is our hope that through education we can ensure that lives will be saved, and history will not be repeated.”

More than 100 guests gathered for the kickoff celebration, including numerous other donors who have followed the Wallachs’ lead by making additional gifts in support of the building and its programs.

“The work we undertake today will stand as a national model of how a university can lead with principle and act with purpose,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As some universities across the nation struggle to confront antisemitism, the Wallach building rises from a profound responsibility that calls to us with urgency. We are taking steps to become the safest and most welcoming university for Jewish life in America, and we are honored that Kurt and Marilyn Wallach’s story has become part of our legacy here at Florida Atlantic.”

The Wallach building will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Arthur and Emalie Gutterman Family Center for Holocaust and Human Rights Education; Holocaust education and Jewish studies programs; the Leon Charney Diplomacy program; and the Center for Peace, Justice and Human Rights, all housed within the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters.

It also will be a South Florida destination for people seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust as they tour the building’s permanent exhibits − the Craig and Barbara Weiner Holocaust Museum of South Florida at Florida Atlantic University and the George and Irina Schaeffer Dimensions in Testimony interactive display. Visitors also can spend time in quiet reflection within the Marta and Jim Batmasian Memorial Pavilion, which is dedicated to the memory of 1.5 million Armenians who died in the Armenian genocide.

The building also will feature a recital/lecture hall and a traveling exhibition hall off the prominent Marilyn and Jay Weinberg Grand Lobby. On the second floor, there will be a conference room, student study space and administrative offices for the programs.

“This wonderful building unleashes opportunities for both students and the community who will learn from the past to create a better world for the future,” said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters. “We are indebted to Kurt and Marilyn for their transformational lead gift to the building and to all the generous benefactors who have linked arms with us to make Florida Atlantic an epicenter of Holocaust and human rights education.”

"Study: AI Agents Shift How Hotels Build Guest Loyalty","The rise of artificial intelligence agents will introduce a new layer of complexity in how the hospitality industry navigates customer loyalty, according to a conceptual paper, “Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents and the Future of Customer Loyalty,” from four researchers at Florida Atlantic University.

The rise of artificial intelligence agents will introduce a new layer of complexity in how the hospitality industry navigates customer loyalty, according to a conceptual paper, “Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents and the Future of Customer Loyalty,” from four researchers at Florida Atlantic University.

Before consumer reliance on AI, most hotels used brand awareness, search engine optimization, and other tools to cultivate customer loyalty. As AI agents and autonomous systems increasingly make travel decisions and bookings on behalf of consumers, hotels will need to rethink how they pursue and maintain customer loyalty and the guest experience.

“AI agents will be the new gatekeepers of loyalty,” said Anil Bilgihan, Ph.D., professor of hospitality management in FAU’s College of Business. “The question is no longer just ‘How do we win a customer’s heart?’ but ‘How do we win the trust of the algorithms that are advising them?’ Hotels need to prepare for a future where a guest’s preferred brand may be decided before the guest even opens their phone.”

The paper was published in the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, with authors Max Ostinelli, Ph.D., assistant professor of marketing; Ye Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of hospitality and management; Melanie Lorenz, Ph.D., associate professor of marketing; along with Bilgihan.

The shift to AI agents will offload many of the decisions consumers make, instead placing them under the control of autonomous AI agents as they become the primary interface for travel decisions, researchers said. As consumers rely on these agents to search for hotels within their travel preferences, check room availability, pricing trends, review sentiment and make bookings on their behalf, the decision-making process for hotels and travel will come from the algorithm, leading to loyalty to the agent or its ecosystem rather than loyalty to the brand.

“Imagine a traveler asking their AI agent to book a hotel in Miami within a certain budget, with a pool and strong reviews,” Bilgihan said. “The AI is not swayed by traditional advertising; it sorts options based on algorithmic criteria. If your hotel doesn’t surface in that recommendation set, you may never even be considered. This means hotels must design loyalty programs, digital visibility and service experiences that appeal simultaneously to human guests and the AI systems filtering choices on their behalf.”

The paper suggests a framework for hotels and the broader hospitality industry to rethink loyalty strategies as autonomous AI agents become the primary way of engaging and booking travel. While emotional branding still matters for human consumers, marketers must prioritize loyalty programs appealing to both humans and AI systems. Researchers suggest using customer data to tailor experiences while at the hotel, algorithmic visibility, and creating loyalty programs appealing to AI and human users.

“Let’s just take Florida, for example. We welcomed over 34 million visitors this summer alone, and that surge, in combination with technological advances, is rewriting the rules of hospitality,” Lorenz said. “To keep up this trend and stay visible in the future, loyalty must be emotionally resonant, algorithmically relevant, and strategically designed for both human travelers and autonomous agents. AI agents are no longer behind-the-scenes helpers; they’re becoming the architects of guest experience. Hotels that design experiences for both human guests and digital decision-makers will lead the next wave of personalized, predictive hospitality.”

Researchers also warned about potential ethical and privacy concerns in the future, highlighting algorithmic bias as some AI systems may be trained on certain data over others, a lack of understanding on the part of consumers as to how AI agents work and brand visibility challenges.

“At the end of the day, technology doesn’t replace the fundamentals,” Bilgihan said. “No algorithm can cover up for a disappointing stay. AI might shape how guests discover and book, but the foundation of loyalty will always be exceptional customer experience once they arrive. Hotels that combine operational excellence with digital fluency will be best positioned to thrive.”

"Research Characterizes Remarkable Skills of Octopus Arms in the Wild","An octopus raises its arm. (Photo credit: Chelsea Bennice, Florida Atlantic University)

Octopuses are among the most neurologically complex invertebrates, famed for their extraordinary dexterity. Their eight arms allow them to capture hidden prey, communicate, explore, and even mate across varied habitats.

Although octopus arms rank among some of the most flexible structures in nature, their full range of movement has rarely been studied in the wild – especially in a range of underwater habitats.

A new study by Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, in collaboration with researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, provides a comprehensive look into how wild octopuses use their arms in natural habitats. By analyzing arm movements across diverse environments, this is the first study to relate arm movements to whole animal behaviors in complex, real-world settings.

The findings, published this week in Scientific Reports, reveal that every arm is capable of performing all action types; however, there was a clear pattern of arm partitioning: front arms mainly use movements to aid in exploration, while back arms use movements that primarily support movement.

Additionally, the octopuses demonstrated remarkable flexibility – single arms were shown to perform multiple arm movements simultaneously and different arm movements were coordinated across several arms, showcasing their complex motor control.

“Observing them in the wild, we saw octopuses use different combinations of arm actions – sometimes just one arm for tasks like grabbing food, and other times multiple arms working together for behaviors like crawling or launching a parachute attack – a hunting technique they use to catch prey,” said Chelsea O. Bennice, Ph.D., lead author and a research fellow at FAU’s Marine Laboratory, Charles E. Schmidt College of Science.

Researchers quantified nearly 4,000 arm movements from 25 video recordings of three wild octopus species observed in six distinct shallow-water habitats – five located in the Caribbean and one in Spain. They identified 12 distinct arm actions across 15 behaviors, each involving one or more of four fundamental arm deformations: shortening (arm length decreases), elongating (arm length increases), bending (arm curves) and torsion (twisting).

“When octopuses move across an open environment, they skillfully use multiple arms to stay camouflaged from predators, such as the moving rock trick or looking like floating seaweed,” said Bennice. “Beyond foraging and locomotion, their arm strength and flexibility are essential for building dens, fending off predators, and competing with rival males during mating. These versatile abilities allow octopuses to thrive in a wide range of habitats.”

In the nearly 7,000 observed arm deformations, all four types – bend, elongate, shorten and torsion – were seen in every arm. However, different regions of each arm – proximal (closest to the body), medial (middle section) and distal (tip) – were found to specialize in specific types of arm deformation, reflecting a sophisticated level of functional specialization; bends mostly occurred near the tips, whereas elongations were more frequent closer to the body.

“I’m a strong believer that you have to get into the natural world, and especially the sensory world, of whatever animal you study,” said Roger Hanlon, Ph.D., co-author and senior scientist, Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. “The fieldwork is very arduous, and it takes a lot of luck to get valid natural behaviors.”

The six octopus habitats in this study varied from smooth, sandy seafloor to highly complex coral reef environments.

“Understanding these natural behaviors not only deepens our knowledge of octopus biology but also opens exciting new avenues in fields like neuroscience, animal behavior and even soft robotics inspired by these remarkable creatures,” said Bennice.

Study co-authors are Kendra C. Buresch, a marine biologist; Jennifer H. Grossman; an undergraduate student, and Tyla D. Morano, all with the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole.

This research was supported in part by the Sholley Foundation, the Ben-Veniste Family Foundation, and the United States Office of Naval Research.

"High Intake of Ultra-processed Foods Linked to Systemic Inflammation","In the U.S., ultra-processed foods account for about 60% of daily calorie intake. (Photo by Alex Dolce)

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are industrially altered products – like soda, snacks and processed meats – packed with additives and stripped of nutrients. Hundreds of new ingredients, previously unknown to the human body, now make up nearly 60% of the average adult’s diet and almost 70% of children’s diets in the United States.

These products reduce nutritional value, extend shelf life, and tend to increase how much people consume. In the U.S., UPFs account for about 60% of daily calorie intake. High consumption of these foods has been linked to greater risks of obesity, cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, mental health issues, and even premature death.

New research from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine shows that people who consume the most UPFs have significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a sensitive marker of inflammation and a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease.

Until now, there have been limited data from nationally representative U.S. populations on the link between UPF intake and hs-CRP levels.

Results of the study, published in The American Journal of Medicine, show that participants consumed a median of 35% of their daily calories from UPFs, ranging from just 0% to 19% in the lowest group to 60% to 79% in the highest. After accounting for factors like age, gender, smoking, physical activity and other health indicators, researchers found that individuals in the highest UPF intake group (60% to 79% of daily calories) had an 11% higher likelihood of elevated hs-CRP levels compared to those in the lowest intake group. Even moderate UPF consumers (40 % to 59%) showed a 14% increase in likelihood. Those with 20% to 39% intake had a smaller, nonsignificant 7% increase.

The likelihood was especially high in certain groups. Adults aged 50 to 59 had a 26% higher risk of elevated inflammatory markers compared to those aged 18 to 29. Obesity contributed to an 80% higher risk compared to people with a healthy weight. Current smokers also had a higher risk (17%) than people who never smoked. Interestingly, individuals who reported no physical activity did not have a statistically significant increase in risk compared to those who met activity guidelines.

“These findings, based on a large and nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, clearly show that people who consume the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods have significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a key marker of inflammation,” said Allison H. Ferris, M.D., FACP, senior author, professor and chair of the FAU Department of Medicine. “These results carry important implications not only for clinical practice and public health strategies but also for future research aimed at understanding and reducing the health risks associated with ultra-processed food consumption.”

Researchers analyzed data from 9,254 U.S. adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, including diet, hs-CRP and other health factors. UPF intake was measured as a percentage of total calories and grouped into four levels. They used statistical methods, including logistic regression, to examine the link between UPF consumption and inflammation.

“C-reactive protein is produced by the liver, and the hs-CRP protein test is a simple, affordable and highly sensitive measure of inflammation as well as a reliable predictor of future cardiovascular disease,” said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. “We believe that health care professionals may wish to consider actively engaging with their patients about the risks of UPFs and benefits of increasing whole food consumption.”

The authors also highlight a significant rise in colorectal cancer rates in the U.S., particularly among younger adults. They suggest that increased consumption of UPFs may be a contributing factor, along with its potential role in several other gastrointestinal diseases.

Drawing a parallel to the history of tobacco, the authors note that it took decades for mounting evidence and the efforts of progressive health officials to lead to policies discouraging cigarette use. They believe a similar trajectory is likely for UPFs, with growing awareness eventually driving meaningful public health action.

“The multinational companies that produce ultra-processed foods are very influential, much like tobacco companies were in the past, so policy changes to promote whole foods and reduce UPF consumption may take time,” said Hennekens. “However, government efforts to reduce harmful additives, improve food labeling, and promote healthier options in programs and schools are important steps in the right direction. At the same time, health care providers should be aware of the challenges many people face in accessing affordable, healthier choices, which calls for a broader and coordinated public health response.”

Study co-authors are Kevin Sajan, a medical student at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine; Nishi Anthireddy, a medical student at FAU; Alexandra Matarazzo, a medical student at FAU; and Caio Furtado, M.D., a resident physician in FAU’s internal medicine residency program.

The 22,000-square-foot, two-story structure will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Holocaust education, Jewish studies and related programs. It also will become a South Florida destination for visitors seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust, including cultural performances, lectures and exhibits that further understanding and respect for humanity. Construction is expected to take approximately 14 months with a targeted opening of fall 2026.

“This is a monumental day, and I know Kurt would be so proud to see this building become a reality,” said Marilyn Wallach. Kurt Wallach died in 2021, a year after the couple made a transformational $20 million gift to FAU to create the Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Institute for Holocaust and Jewish Studies, with a portion used as the lead gift to construct the Wallach building.

“Kurt always said, “We speak for those who cannot speak, and we remember all the victims, including our family members who perished needlessly,” Marilyn Wallach said. “It is our hope that through education we can ensure that lives will be saved, and history will not be repeated.”

More than 100 guests gathered for the kickoff celebration, including numerous other donors who have followed the Wallachs’ lead by making additional gifts in support of the building and its programs.

“The work we undertake today will stand as a national model of how a university can lead with principle and act with purpose,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As some universities across the nation struggle to confront antisemitism, the Wallach building rises from a profound responsibility that calls to us with urgency. We are taking steps to become the safest and most welcoming university for Jewish life in America, and we are honored that Kurt and Marilyn Wallach’s story has become part of our legacy here at Florida Atlantic.”

The Wallach building will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Arthur and Emalie Gutterman Family Center for Holocaust and Human Rights Education; Holocaust education and Jewish studies programs; the Leon Charney Diplomacy program; and the Center for Peace, Justice and Human Rights, all housed within the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters.

It also will be a South Florida destination for people seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust as they tour the building’s permanent exhibits − the Craig and Barbara Weiner Holocaust Museum of South Florida at Florida Atlantic University and the George and Irina Schaeffer Dimensions in Testimony interactive display. Visitors also can spend time in quiet reflection within the Marta and Jim Batmasian Memorial Pavilion, which is dedicated to the memory of 1.5 million Armenians who died in the Armenian genocide.

The building also will feature a recital/lecture hall and a traveling exhibition hall off the prominent Marilyn and Jay Weinberg Grand Lobby. On the second floor, there will be a conference room, student study space and administrative offices for the programs.

“This wonderful building unleashes opportunities for both students and the community who will learn from the past to create a better world for the future,” said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters. “We are indebted to Kurt and Marilyn for their transformational lead gift to the building and to all the generous benefactors who have linked arms with us to make Florida Atlantic an epicenter of Holocaust and human rights education.”

"FAU Publishes Initial Annual Report: Florida Office of Ocean Economy","Housed at FAU, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries.

Few places in the world are as closely tied to the ocean as Florida. From our working waterfronts and bustling ports to fishing, tourism and recreation, the ocean is not just a natural asset; it is a cornerstone of our state’s economy and identity.

As such, in 2024 the Florida legislature selected Florida Atlantic University to house its Florida Office of Ocean Economy, a state effort to better understand, support and grow the ocean and coastal-based industries that drive jobs, investment and innovation across the state. FAU has published its initial annual report for the Florida Office of Ocean Economy.

Established by the Florida legislature in 2024 under the visionary leadership of the Florida legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries. Serving as a central hub for collaboration across business, research, capital and policy, the office is building the foundation for a thriving ocean economy.

“Florida Atlantic is proud to be the home of the state’s Office of Ocean Economy, a vital initiative advancing economic growth through the sustainable use of our ocean and coastal resources,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As a nationally recognized leader in marine science, ocean engineering and environmental research, Florida Atlantic is deeply committed to driving innovation, protecting ecosystems and preparing the next generation of talent. We look forward to working alongside our partners to cultivate an ocean economy that delivers opportunity, security and prosperity for every Floridian.”

Florida’s ocean economy is a vital and complex system that fuels prosperity across the state and serves as a cornerstone of its identity. With thousands of miles of coastline and a vibrant marine and coastal landscape, Florida supports a diverse set of industries that rely on healthy ocean resources, from ports and seafood to tourism and recreation. In 2023 alone, ocean-related activity sustained approximately 909,000 jobs, generated $59 billion in labor income and contributed $96 billion in Gross State Product. This represents more than 6% of the state’s total economic output, making Florida not only the largest ocean economy by employment in the United States, but also one of the most ocean-dependent economies in the world.

Florida’s ocean economy is guided by a robust framework of state initiatives and programs that sustain the economic productivity of coastal regions while protecting vital marine resources. From strategic port investments and aquaculture development to coastal resilience and beach renourishment, the state’s policy architecture enables Florida to lead the nation in ocean-related employment and economic activity.

The Florida Office of Ocean Economy will continue to collaborate closely with a diverse network of partners across sectors and disciplines. Key partners include state agencies and academic institutions such as the Florida Institute of Oceanography and other universities; federally funded research centers; industry leaders in marine transportation, tourism, aquaculture and renewable energy; nonprofit organizations focused on ocean conservation; federal agencies including NOAA and the U.S. Department of Energy; and private sector innovators driving marine technology and infrastructure development. This broad coalition strengthens Florida’s ocean economy by aligning resources, expertise and strategic vision toward sustainable growth and resilience.
