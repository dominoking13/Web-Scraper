"FAU Study: Small Group Counseling Helps Children Thrive at School","FAU College of Education researchers found small group counseling improves sixth graders’ emotional skills, school connectedness, and engagement, supporting social and academic growth. Study Snapshot: Many students experience anxiety, stress or disconnection at school, which can hinder both their academic and social-emotional growth. While school counselors provide support, traditional programs often lack structured, evidence-based approaches to help students manage emotions, build peer relationships, and develop essential skills. FAU College of Education researchers explored the impact of the Student Success Skills small group counseling intervention for sixth graders. Over six sessions, students developed anger management, goal setting, and social problem-solving skills while building trust and community. Results of the study showed greater connectedness, improved perceptions of school climate, and increased engagement, highlighting the effectiveness of Advocating Student-Within-Environment or ASE-based small group counseling in supporting students’ emotional and academic growth. Across the United States, children spend more than 1,100 hours in school each year – time that shapes not only their academic success but also their emotional and social growth. Yet, for many students, the school environment can also be a source of anxiety and apprehension. School counselors play a pivotal role in addressing these challenges through evidence-based, comprehensive guidance programs. Addressing this critical need, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Department of Counselor Education within the College of Education conducted a qualitative study to explore how participation in the Student Success Skills (SSS) small group counseling intervention influences middle school students’ sense of connectedness to their school environment, guided by the Advocating Student-Within-Environment (ASE) theory. Working with sixth graders in the Southeastern U.S., the research team collected data through pre- and post-intervention interviews, field notes, session transcripts, student-generated drawings and counseling activities. They used thematic analysis to identify key patterns and themes of how the intervention helped students develop anger management, academic and life skills – abilities that, in turn, would strengthen their engagement and perception of school climate. The results of the study, published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Counseling, identified four key outcomes: improved anger management and conflict resolution, the development of academic and life skills, increased feelings of connectedness and safety, and more positive perceptions of the overall school environment. Students learned practical emotional regulation strategies, such as positive self-talk and seeking peer support, and engaged in role-playing exercises to practice conflict resolution and goal setting. As the sessions progressed, students’ drawings and interview responses reflected a noticeable shift – from neutral or negative portrayals of school to images and statements highlighting friendship, belonging and motivation to learn. “As the students became more connected to one another, so did their sense of contribution and compassion, which extended far beyond the school environment,” said Elizabeth Villares Sacks, Ph.D., co-author and chair and professor, FAU Department of Counselor Education. “Small group counseling provided students with far more than strategies for managing emotions and relationships – it offered them a space to feel seen, heard and valued. Through these shared experiences, students began to recognize their own strengths and see themselves not just as learners, but as capable, compassionate contributors within their school communities and beyond.” Findings revealed notable growth in trust and community among group members. Students collaboratively developed confidentiality agreements and group norms, creating a safe space for authentic sharing and peer support. By cultivating social-emotional and academic skills, this approach enhances engagement, connectedness and perceptions of school climate. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness of ASE-based small group counseling in promoting students’ emotional and academic development and suggest the need for further research on its broader systemic impact in schools. “Interventions grounded in ASE not only support students’ emotional growth but transform how they experience their school environments,” Villares Sacks said. “When students feel connected and understood, they become more engaged learners and more compassionate peers.” The study was conducted during the 2023-24 school year and involved five sixth-grade students who were identified as being at academic or behavioral risk. Over six weekly sessions, a trained school counselor led the students through the SSS small group intervention, focusing on anger management, goal setting, social problem-solving and self-management. Study co-authors are Kadeem Campbell, Ph.D., senior author who received his Ph.D. from FAU in 2023; Hannah Bowers, Ph.D., associate professor of school counseling; and Greg Brigman, Ph.D., all within the FAU Department of Counselor Education. Integrating small group counseling into evidence-based school counseling programs enables counselors to help students build supportive peer relationships, develop essential skills, and strengthen their sense of belonging. The authors recommend further research on the long-term and systemic effects of ASE-aligned curricula, along with expanded training for counselors in evidence-based group facilitation. Their findings affirm that school investments in counselor-led interventions grounded in empathy, connection and collaboration foster stronger, more resilient learning communities.

"FAU Study: Drones Map Loggerhead Sea Turtle Nesting Site Hotspots","Graduate student and lead author, Summer Manestar, holding the UX11 unmanned aerial vehicle that was used in the study. Study Snapshot: Researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science used drones and field surveys to study how environmental and human factors affect loggerhead sea turtle nest site selection on a high-density beach in Boca Raton. The team looked at beach slope, sand texture, and proximity to structures like dune stairs – wooden stairways that let people safely cross sand dunes without damaging them. Understanding these factors is important because where turtles nest directly affects hatchling survival and sex ratios. The study found that successful nests were more likely on steeper parts of the beach and farther from dune stairs, while false crawls – when sea turtles come ashore but do not lay eggs – were more common in flatter areas or near stairs. These findings give researchers new tools for monitoring nesting activity and help guide efforts to protect Florida’s critical sea turtle habitats. Florida’s beaches – particularly those in Palm Beach County – are among the world’s most vital nesting grounds for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), accounting for 90% of all loggerhead nests in the Southeastern United States. Where a sea turtle chooses to nest is a delicate balance between the energy spent searching for the right spot and the benefits that location provides for successful egg incubation. Because nest placement directly influences hatchling survival, emergence success, and even sex ratios, understanding the factors that guide these decisions is critical. Changing coastal and environmental conditions, sea level rise, and other impacts threaten these fragile habitats, altering the limited environmental conditions that turtles depend on for nesting. By identifying areas with higher or lower nesting activity, researchers can better understand what makes certain habitats more suitable and work to protect them for future generations. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science have taken an important step in uncovering these patterns. Using drones and surveys, they investigated the environmental and human-related factors that influence loggerhead sea turtle nest site selection. They also looked at how these factors vary between successful nesting attempts and false crawls – when a turtle emerges from the ocean but returns without laying eggs. The research led by Summer L. Manestar, who completed her M.S. in marine science and oceanography in FAU’s Department of Geosciences, was conducted on a high-density nesting beach in Boca Raton, one of the most active loggerhead nesting regions in the world. Published in the journal Shore & Beach, the study combined drone-based photogrammetry – a technique that uses images captured by drones to create accurate, detailed maps and 3D models of the landscape – Real Time Kinematic GPS surveys, and sediment granulometry to measure beach slope, sand texture, and nest proximity to artificial structures such as dune crossover stairs. Statistical analyses, including generalized linear models and t-tests, were used to assess which environmental and anthropogenic variables most strongly influenced whether a nesting attempt was successful. The results showed that the steepness of the beach and how close dune crossover stairs were to nesting areas were the most important factors influencing turtle nesting. Loggerheads were less likely to attempt nesting on beaches with steeper slopes or when the stairs were farther away. Beach width and sand type did not seem to make much difference. Overall, the distance to dune crossover stairs was consistently important, suggesting that even small changes in the placement of human structures can affect whether turtles successfully nest. Analysis of nesting patterns showed that turtles tended to nest more in the northern and central parts of the beach, while the southern end had fewer nests but more failed attempts. Early in the season, there were many more false crawls than successful nests. Later in the season, the same northern and central areas remained popular for nesting, but false crawls were spread more evenly. Nest locations also shifted over time, with more early-season nests in the mid-beach area and more late-season nests near the backbeach, suggesting that changing conditions influence where turtles lay eggs. “This research really demonstrates how new technology can deepen our understanding of natural processes,” said Tiffany Roberts Briggs, Ph.D., co-author and chair of FAU’s Department of Geosciences. “By combining drone-based mapping with on-the-ground data collection, our team has revealed how even small variations in beach shape or the presence of human structures can influence whether a sea turtle successfully nests. These findings are not just important for science – they directly inform how we manage and protect Florida’s beaches for generations to come.” Compared to satellites or LiDAR, drones provide high-resolution, affordable data that help researchers see small features of the beach that affect where turtles choose to nest. The research team emphasizes that understanding how both natural features and human-made structures influence sea turtle nesting can guide coastal development and conservation policy in meaningful ways. The framework established through this work could also be applied to other species of sea turtles, including green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea), to gain a more comprehensive understanding of nesting ecology along Florida’s dynamic coastline. “Projects like this highlight how innovation and conservation go hand in hand,” said Roberts Briggs. “When we can pinpoint what makes a beach successful for nesting, we can take concrete steps to ensure that Florida remains a haven for these incredible animals.” Study co-author is James Gammack-Clark, a senior instructor in the FAU Department of Geosciences.

"FAU Engineering Study Takes a 'Quantum Leap' to Detect Kidney Disease","Researchers explored how machine learning and quantum computing can be used to improve early detection of chronic kidney disease, aiming to develop faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for clinicians. Study Snapshot: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) gradually damages the kidneys and often shows few symptoms until it is advanced, making early detection difficult. Millions of people worldwide are affected, and timely diagnosis is critical to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Traditional detection methods can be slow and may miss subtle signs of the disease, highlighting the need for faster, more accurate tools. Researchers are exploring how machine learning and quantum computing can help. In a new study, they compared a classical machine learning system with a quantum-based approach to detect CKD. While the classical system proved more accurate and faster under current conditions, the quantum system still showed promising results, suggesting that hybrid quantum-classical tools could play an important role in the future. This work points toward smarter, faster and more precise diagnostic systems that could ultimately help clinicians detect CKD earlier and improve patient care. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one such condition – a progressive illness that damages the kidneys over time, eventually leading to kidney failure if left untreated. Because CKD develops gradually and often shows few symptoms in its early stages, timely diagnosis is a major clinical challenge. Globally, an estimated 850 million people are living with some form of kidney disease. Among them, as many as 10 million require dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive. Despite the scale of this problem, CKD frequently goes undetected until it reaches an advanced stage. Early diagnosis is essential not only to slow disease progression but also to improve quality of life and survival rates. To help address this widespread issue, researchers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) to build automated tools that can detect CKD more efficiently and accurately. ML algorithms can recognize subtle patterns in complex medical data – patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed by clinicians. Research from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University is taking this concept further by exploring how quantum computing could enhance the accuracy and performance of ML-driven CKD diagnosis systems. Arslan Munir, Ph.D., senior author and an associate professor in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and his colleagues from Bangladesh, developed and compared two automated systems for CKD diagnosis: the Classical Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM). The goal of their study was to evaluate the efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of both approaches, and to better understand how emerging quantum machine learning techniques could eventually revolutionize real-world medical diagnostics. The team began by preparing and refining a CKD dataset, applying comprehensive data preprocessing to ensure the reliability of results. They then used two advanced data optimization methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce noise and improve computational efficiency. Each optimized dataset was subsequently analyzed using both CSVM and QSVM algorithms, allowing for a detailed comparison of the two methods’ predictive capabilities. The results of the study, published in the journal Informatics and Health, revealed clear differences. When paired with PCA, CSVM achieved a remarkable 98.75% accuracy, while QSVM reached 87.5%. Using SVD, the CSVM achieved 96.25%, compared to 60% for the QSVM. The classical SVM also proved far faster: up to 42 times quicker than the QSVM in certain experimental settings. The outcome indicates that, under current hardware conditions, the classical approach remains superior in both accuracy and time efficiency. However, Munir and his colleagues emphasized that QSVM’s underperformance is primarily a reflection of today’s computational limitations rather than the potential of quantum algorithms themselves. Even within the constraints of classical hardware, the QSVM still achieved competitive performance – its 87.5% accuracy using PCA surpasses that of several existing classical SVM methods reported in prior studies. This suggests that hybrid quantum-classical systems could play an increasingly important role in the near term, combining the strengths of both paradigms to improve diagnostic precision while managing current technological challenges. “What makes our work unique is that we didn’t just apply classical machine learning to detect chronic kidney disease – we also tested a quantum version under the same conditions,” said Munir. “By directly comparing classical and quantum models, and using two different optimization methods, we gained valuable insight into where the technology stands today and how quantum computing could help shape the future of health care analytics.” Looking ahead, the research team plans to extend their work by exploring additional quantum ML algorithms beyond QSVM and testing their methods on larger, more diverse medical datasets. They also intend to focus on optimizing feature selection techniques to ensure scalability and adaptability across a wide range of diagnostic applications. Ultimately, the goal is to create more reliable, efficient and accessible AI-driven diagnostic tools that can assist clinicians in making faster, more accurate medical decisions. “This research is an important leap toward bringing quantum computing into health care – an emerging field with the power to transform how we detect and treat complex diseases,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “By combining machine learning with next-generation quantum technologies, this work offers real hope for earlier, faster and more accurate diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, ultimately improving outcomes and saving lives.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.","https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/quantum-leap-kidney-disease.php"

"FAU Secures $1.4 Million Grant to Save Wildlife in Florida Everglades","FAU researchers conduct surveys and fieldwork in the Florida Everglades. (Photo by Alex Dolce) Grant Snapshot: Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science has received a five-year, $1.4 million grant from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to study dry-season prey concentrations in the Florida Everglades. Led by Michelle L. Petersen, Ph.D., the project will collect and analyze data on aquatic prey and habitat conditions, helping scientists understand the key factors that drive wading bird nesting success. The research will fill a critical gap in knowledge by showing where and when prey concentrate during the dry season, information that is essential for guiding ecosystem restoration under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. By linking water conditions, prey availability and bird nesting, the project will support more effective management strategies and help protect the Everglades’ iconic wildlife for the future. Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science has received a five-year, $1,427,679 grant from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to fund a project titled, “Dry Season Prey Concentrations in the Florida Everglades.” The project is led by Michelle L. Petersen, Ph.D., assistant research professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, and director of the Environmental Science Program in the School of Environmental, Coastal and Ocean Sustainability. Petersen and her team will collect and analyze critical data on aquatic prey and habitat conditions during the dry season across the freshwater Everglades, providing essential insight into one of the most important drivers of wading bird nesting success. “This project is incredibly exciting because it allows us to quantify the link between water conditions, fish populations and wading bird nesting across the Everglades,” said Petersen. “By identifying when and where prey concentrations occur, we can better understand what drives nesting success and provide information that directly supports restoration efforts in this unique and vital ecosystem.” The research directly supports the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), a large-scale effort authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to restore South Florida’s ecosystem by modifying water management practices. A vital component of CERP is the Monitoring and Assessment Plan (MAP), which was developed to evaluate ecological responses to restoration, track progress toward restoration goals, and guide adaptive management decisions. “One of the biggest questions we’re trying to answer through this project is how wading birds respond to changes in water levels, especially during the dry season when the concentration of prey can make or break their nesting success,” said Petersen. Declines in wading bird populations have been linked to reductions in fish and other aquatic prey, particularly when these prey fail to concentrate in small patches that birds can efficiently exploit. Research shows that wet-season prey abundance alone does not predict nesting success; rather, it is the formation of dense prey concentrations in drying wetlands that largely determines whether wading birds can sustain large, successful colonies. Petersen’s project will provide quantitative data on where, when and how these concentrations occur across the Everglades landscape, including Everglades National Park, the Water Conservation Areas, and the C-111 Basin. The project builds on prior MAP-supported research and will employ a probabilistic, multi-stage sampling framework designed to measure maximum aquatic prey densities and track inter-annual variability in relation to hydrologic conditions. Researchers will also examine how local site characteristics, regional prey populations, and microtopography influence prey concentrations. These data will fill a critical knowledge gap: prior to MAP studies, little was known about the location, frequency and ecological importance of fish concentrations in drying wetlands because monitoring traditionally ceased once water levels dropped too low for boat access. Beyond its ecological significance, the project contributes to the broader mission of the Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units by promoting ecosystem-based research, training the next generation of scientists and informing science-based management decisions. “Dr. Petersen’s work underscores the vital role university-led research plays in driving effective ecosystem restoration and generating studies that inform crucial state and federal agency actions on comprehensive environmental stewardship,” said Valery E. Forbes, Ph.D., dean of the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “This grant reflects the excellence of her work and commitment to producing impactful science that will safeguard the Everglades for generations to come.” Fieldwork will include systematic dry-season sampling using a stratified design to capture prey densities across the Everglades’ complex freshwater habitats. Data collection will focus on shallow sloughs undergoing seasonal drying – areas where prey concentrations are expected to peak – and will employ standardized methods to ensure comparability across sites and years. The results will be used to inform CERP’s restoration strategies and provide managers with the evidence needed to support wading bird populations and overall ecosystem recovery. “We anticipate this project will greatly improve our understanding of the links between hydrology, prey availability, and wading bird nesting, providing crucial insight into how restoration efforts can most effectively achieve the goals of CERP,” said Petersen. “By combining long-term monitoring with innovative analysis, this work marks an important step forward in both the science and management of one of the world’s most iconic wetland ecosystems.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.","https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/everglades-wildlife-grant.php"
"FAU's CAROSEL Offers New 'Spin' on Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring","Jordon Beckler, Ph.D., and Mason Thackston (in the water) test their new device, the Chamber ARray for Observing Sediment Exchanges Long-term or CAROSEL for short. Study Snapshot: FAU Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute researchers have developed the CAROSEL (Chamber ARray for Observing Sediment Exchanges Long-term), an autonomous underwater system that continuously measures how nutrients like ammonium move between sediments and overlying water. For the first time, scientists can observe these exchanges in real time, multiple times a day, over extended periods – offering an unprecedented look at how sediments influence water chemistry. This insight is vital because nutrient releases from sediments can fuel harmful algal blooms, degrade water quality and disrupt aquatic ecosystems. By revealing how quickly these processes respond to changes in light, oxygen and weather, CAROSEL provides a powerful new tool for managing nutrient pollution and improving the health of lakes, estuaries and coastal waters. Beneath the surface of lakes and coastal waters lies a hidden world of sediment that plays a crucial role in the health of aquatic ecosystems. “Benthic fluxes” of nitrogen and phosphorus, such as releases of these dissolved nutrients from sediments to their overlying waters,can fuel algae growth and toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs), which degrade water quality, disrupt wildlife and recreation, and reduce property values. Sediments act as a natural archive, offering historical insights into ecosystem health. However, to fully understand nutrient exchanges between sediment and water, scientists rely on measurements of benthic fluxes, like the amount of nitrogen transported across the sediment/water interface in typical units of pounds per square meter of sediment area per day. Traditional monitoring methods are slow, costly and challenging, and while newer autonomous systems show promise, few studies have explored how these systems can reveal how sediments contribute to or sustain HABs – an essential step in managing and protecting aquatic ecosystems. For example, in Florida’s Lake Okeechobee, benthic nutrient fluxes are the dominant source of nutrients fueling algal growth in this shallow turbid water body. Florida Atlantic University Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute researchers are the first to continuously track the exchanges of different forms of nitrogen between bottom sediments and the overlying water. Most importantly, their novel approach enables measuring how much ammonium (NH₄⁺) is released from sediments in real time, multiple times a day, over an extended period – offering an unprecedented, detailed view of this critical nutrient exchange and preferred nutrient source of algal blooms. Their secret weapon? A new device called CAROSEL – short for Chamber ARray for Observing Sediment Exchanges Long-term. The CAROSEL is a smart, underwater monitoring system designed to study how nutrients and other chemicals move between lake or ocean sediments and the water above. Unlike older methods that required two boat (or ship) trips and manpower to deploy and retrieve instrumentation packages to obtain only a single benthic flux data time point, the CAROSEL works automatically, taking multiple measurements each day without human help for periods of several weeks. For the study, researchers tested the CAROSEL in a shallow freshwater retention pond on the FAU Harbor Branch campus in Fort Pierce. The goal was to better understand the interplay of nutrients and oxygen over both day and multi-day cycles, enabling better insights into the total nitrogen available as a function of the time of day and the weather. However, it also improved estimates of the nutrients removed from this pond system over time. These retention ponds – found all over Florida – are a common Best Management Practice (BMP) employed as part of the state’s regulations to do just that: eliminate the nutrients flowing to coastal estuaries. Results of their research, published in the journal Limnology & Oceanography, also reveal that oxygen fluxes in the water followed a daily rhythm: increasing during the day from photosynthesis and decreasing at night due to respiration. Conversely, sediments consistently consumed oxygen from the overlying water. The sediments also released NH₄⁺ throughout the study, while the water column showed signs of nitrogen being added during the day and broken down at night – a surprising finding considering photosynthetic growth during the day would be expected to consume nutrients. After rainstorms, both NH₄⁺ and nitrate fluxes changed quickly, showing how sensitive these processes are to the environment. It was also clear that nitrogen removal through nitrification/denitrification – the main process desired in these BMP systems – was intense but also highly variable over time. Uniquely, the CAROSEL captured high-frequency, real-time data, revealing sharp, short-term fluctuations in nutrient and oxygen exchange. These findings challenge the common assumption that sediment processes are slow or steady, and underscore how tools like the CAROSEL can uncover the hidden, dynamic forces shaping water quality. “What’s most exciting is that CAROSEL gave us a detailed, hour-by-hour view of how weather and environmental changes directly affect the chemistry between the lake bottom and the water above,” said Jordon Beckler, Ph.D., senior author, an associate research professor at FAU Harbor Branch and an FAU Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) fellow. “That level of detail helps us untangle the complex chain reactions happening in lakes and estuaries – something that’s been incredibly hard to do until now with such low-resolution conventional benthic flux data. We see this technology as a powerful new tool for understanding how these fluxes drive ecosystem dynamics, especially given the explosion of harmful algal blooms globally over the last few decades. I see sediments, which cover about 70% of the Earth’s surface, as the next water, soil or air – for which we already have developed an appreciation for their health and conservation.” This detailed view will help scientists understand how quickly nutrients cycle and how factors like light, temperature and storms drive those changes – key to improving water quality monitoring and management. The CAROSEL shows strong potential as a tool for tracking and responding to issues like nutrient pollution, HABs, low oxygen “dead zones,” carbon cycling, and even organic and heavy metal contaminants amid shifting environmental conditions. Study co-authors are Donald Nuzzio, Ph.D., president of Analytical Instrument Systems, Inc.; and Csaba Vaczo, a mechanical engineer at FAU Harbor Branch.

"'Frazzled' Fruit Flies Help Unravel How Neural Circuits Stay Wired","Extreme close-up of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) using scanning electron microscopy. Study Snapshot: Florida Atlantic University neuroscientists have identified a surprising new role for a protein called “Frazzled” (DCC in humans) in helping fruit fly neurons connect and communicate at lightning speed. Studying the Giant Fiber System, which controls the flies’ rapid escape reflex, they found that when Frazzled is missing or mutated, neurons fail to form proper electrical connections, slowing neural responses and weakening muscle control. Using genetic tools, the researchers showed that the intracellular portion of Frazzled alone could restore normal communication, revealing that this part of the protein regulates the genes needed to build gap junctions. Florida Atlantic University neuroscientists have uncovered a surprising role for a protein named “Frazzled” (known as DCC in mammals) in the nervous system of fruit flies, showing how it helps neurons connect and communicate with lightning speed. The discovery sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms that ensure neurons form reliable connections, or synapses, a process essential for all nervous systems, from insects to humans. In the study, researchers focused on the Giant Fiber (GF) System of Drosophila, a neural circuit that controls this fruit fly’s rapid escape reflex. With this work, the team has not only revealed a key molecular player in fruit fly neural circuits but also demonstrated the power of combining genetics, imaging, physiology and computational modeling to uncover how brains stay wired – and what happens when they don’t. The results, published in the journal eNeuro, reveal that when Frazzled is missing or mutated, the system falters: neurons fail to form proper electrical connections, the fly’s neural responses slow down, and communication between the GF neurons and the muscles they control weakens. These defects are linked to a loss of gap junctions, tiny channels that allow neurons to transmit signals directly and rapidly. In particular, the team found that the loss of a protein called shaking-B(neural+16), which forms these junctions in the presynaptic terminals, underlies much of the misfiring. To understand Frazzled’s precise role, the researchers used a genetic tool known as the UAS-GAL4 system to reintroduce different pieces of the Frazzled protein into mutant flies. Strikingly, just the intracellular portion of Frazzled – the part inside the neuron that can influence gene expression – was enough to restore both the structure of the synapses and the speed of neuronal communication. When this portion was disrupted, such as by deleting a key domain called P3 or mutating a crucial site within it, the rescue failed, indicating that Frazzled’s control of gene activity is essential for building gap junctions. Beyond laboratory experiments, the team also created a computational model of the GF System, simulating how the number of gap junctions affects the neurons’ ability to fire reliably. The model confirmed that even small changes in gap junction density can drastically alter the speed and precision of neural signals. “The combination of experimental and computational work allowed us to see not just that Frazzled matters, but exactly how it shapes the connections that let neurons talk to each other,” said Rodney Murphey, Ph.D., senior author and a professor of biological sciences in the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Our next steps are to explore whether similar mechanisms control neural circuits in other species, including mammals, and to see how this might influence learning, memory or even repair after injury.” Interestingly, while Frazzled has long been studied as a guidance molecule – helping neurons grow along the correct paths – the study revealed that its intracellular domain also directly regulates synapse formation. Flies lacking Frazzled often showed neurons that grew in random directions, failing to reach their targets. Restoring the intracellular domain corrected many of these guidance errors, demonstrating a dual role for Frazzled in both wiring neurons and fine-tuning their communication. This work also draws parallels to other organisms. Similar proteins in worms and vertebrates have been shown to influence chemical synapses, suggesting that Frazzled and its relatives may play a broadly conserved role in shaping neural networks. By showing how a single protein controls both the physical and functional aspects of electrical synapses, this study opens a window into the fundamental rules governing nervous system assembly. “Understanding how neurons form reliable connections is a central question in neuroscience,” Murphey said. “Frazzled gives us a clear handle on one piece of that puzzle. Our findings could inform future studies of neural development, neurodegenerative diseases and strategies to repair damaged circuits.” Study co-authors are first author Juan Lopez, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science; Jana Boerner, Ph.D., managing director of the Advanced Cell Imaging Core within the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute; Kelli Robbins, research staff in FAU’s Department of Biological Sciences; and Rodrigo Pena, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biological sciences in the Charles E.
