"College of Nursing Receives $1.8M Gift from Mark Bruce Swillinger","Mark Bruce Swillinger has donated a $1.5 million gift to Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing in memory of his late wife, Marilyn Lee Swillinger, to establish an endowed professorship in hospice and palliative care nursing.

Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing has received a $1.5 million gift from Mark Bruce Swillinger in memory of his wife, Marilyn Lee Swillinger, to establish an endowed professorship in hospice and palliative care nursing. The Mark Bruce and Marilyn Lee Swillinger Endowed Professor will expose nursing students to specialized studies in hospice and palliative care throughout their nursing education. Additional gifts totaling $300,000 name the dean’s conference room for Marilyn Lee Swillinger, and the collaborative classroom for Mark and Marilyn together.

Marilyn Lee Swillinger, who passed away on Oct. 30, 2023, after a two-year battle with lung cancer, was especially passionate about supporting health care and the arts. She was a longtime member of the College of Nursing’s advisory board and supported other FAU colleges and departments, in addition to numerous other local charitable organizations.

“This is my opportunity to memorialize Marilyn and give back to the community, which has given so much to us,” said Mark Swillinger. “I can’t say enough about the treatment that hospice gave to Marilyn and me. It’s important not only to the people in need but also for everyone within our community.”

The Mark Bruce and Marilyn Lee Swillinger Endowed Professorship in Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing will provide support in perpetuity for a professor with expertise in hospice and palliative care who will direct the integration of this nursing specialty into the undergraduate curriculum that includes academics, simulation, clinical training, and preparation for certification in all levels in hospice and palliative care. This professor will also introduce students to this important specialty early in their academic careers and promote and prepare them for rewarding careers in hospice and palliative care.

“Our region faces critical shortages in nursing and health care, and this generous gift will have a lasting impact on the university and the communities we serve,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “Through their involvement and support over the years, Mark and Marilyn truly embraced Florida Atlantic as their hometown university. We are grateful that Mark chose to establish this meaningful legacy in memory of Marilyn in our College of Nursing.”

The need for hospice and palliative care is especially acute in Florida as more than 21% of state residents are age 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a number expected to grow to 27% by 2030. And the overall need for nurses continues to be crucial. FAU’s College of Nursing will be the first in the region to offer such a program focused on hospice and palliative care.

“As a member of the College of Nursing’s first advisory board, Marilyn had a profound influence on the college, helping it grow to what it is today,” said Cameron Duncan, Ph.D., DNP, Holli Rockwell Trubinsky Eminent Dean of Nursing. “Hospice and palliative care are so important to the community, and so many lives are going to be impacted because of Mark’s generosity.”

"FAU Kicks Off Construction of Wallach Building","From left, FAU President Adam Hasner; FAU benefactor Marilyn Wallach; Mark Wallach; and Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters at FAU, celebrate the start of construction of the Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Holocaust and Jewish Studies Building.

Florida Atlantic University celebrated the start of construction of its Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Holocaust and Jewish Studies Building. The 22,000-square-foot, two-story structure will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Holocaust education, Jewish studies and related programs. It also will become a South Florida destination for visitors seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust, including cultural performances, lectures and exhibits that further understanding and respect for humanity. Construction is expected to take approximately 14 months with a targeted opening of fall 2026.

“This is a monumental day, and I know Kurt would be so proud to see this building become a reality,” said Marilyn Wallach. Kurt Wallach died in 2021, a year after the couple made a transformational $20 million gift to FAU to create the Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Institute for Holocaust and Jewish Studies, with a portion used as the lead gift to construct the Wallach building.

“Kurt always said, “We speak for those who cannot speak, and we remember all the victims, including our family members who perished needlessly,” Marilyn Wallach said. “It is our hope that through education we can ensure that lives will be saved, and history will not be repeated.”

More than 100 guests gathered for the kickoff celebration, including numerous other donors who have followed the Wallachs’ lead by making additional gifts in support of the building and its programs.

“The work we undertake today will stand as a national model of how a university can lead with principle and act with purpose,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As some universities across the nation struggle to confront antisemitism, the Wallach building rises from a profound responsibility that calls to us with urgency. We are taking steps to become the safest and most welcoming university for Jewish life in America, and we are honored that Kurt and Marilyn Wallach’s story has become part of our legacy here at Florida Atlantic.”

The Wallach building will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Arthur and Emalie Gutterman Family Center for Holocaust and Human Rights Education; Holocaust education and Jewish studies programs; the Leon Charney Diplomacy program; and the Center for Peace, Justice and Human Rights, all housed within the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters.

It also will be a South Florida destination for people seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust as they tour the building’s permanent exhibits − the Craig and Barbara Weiner Holocaust Museum of South Florida at Florida Atlantic University and the George and Irina Schaeffer Dimensions in Testimony interactive display. Visitors also can spend time in quiet reflection within the Marta and Jim Batmasian Memorial Pavilion, which is dedicated to the memory of 1.5 million Armenians who died in the Armenian genocide.

The building also will feature a recital/lecture hall and a traveling exhibition hall off the prominent Marilyn and Jay Weinberg Grand Lobby. On the second floor, there will be a conference room, student study space and administrative offices for the programs.

“This wonderful building unleashes opportunities for both students and the community who will learn from the past to create a better world for the future,” said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters. “We are indebted to Kurt and Marilyn for their transformational lead gift to the building and to all the generous benefactors who have linked arms with us to make Florida Atlantic an epicenter of Holocaust and human rights education.”

"Unrealized Losses in U.S. Banks Hold Steady in Q2","Unrealized losses in U.S. banks’ portfolios of investment securities remained relatively unchanged at the end of the second quarter of the year, posing continuing concerns about the stability of the banking system, according to a screener from a banking and finance expert at Florida Atlantic University.

Unrealized losses in U.S. banks’ portfolios of investment securities remained relatively unchanged at the end of the second quarter of the year, posing continuing concerns about the stability of the banking system, according to a screener from a banking and finance expert at Florida Atlantic University.

Aggregate unbooked losses on investment securities on U.S. bank balance sheets declined by $17 billion from the first quarter of 2025 ($414 billion) to the second quarter of 2025 ($397 billion). The two basis-point decline in long-term Treasury Bond rates from Mar. 31 (4.25%) to June 30 (4.23%) had little impact on security values, with most of the decline due to sales of securities rather than to changes in the value of securities.

“The largest consequences are that these banks have about $6 trillion tied up in these securities that are losing money, preventing them from making new loans,” said Rebel Cole, Ph.D., Lynn Eminent Chaired professor of finance in FAU’s College of Business. “This chokes off the availability of credit from these banks for making loans to consumers, businesses, and anyone else they lend to. The banks cannot sell those securities without realizing these losses, so they are losing money, making it more difficult for them to originate new loans.”

Only one “relatively small bank” reported losses greater than CET1 equity, down from two in the first quarter of 2025, according to the U.S. Banks’ Unrealized Losses on Investment Securities screener. Only 16 banks reported unbooked losses equal to 50% or more of CET1, down from 24 in the first quarter of 2025, and 34 in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Of the 4,477 banks reporting in the second quarter of the year, Cole focused on 1,049 banks with more than $1 billion in assets to calculate unrealized losses on investment securities and compare those losses to a bank’s CET1. The losses on the “available for sale” securities portfolio are subtracted from Total Equity Capital as “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,” but there is an “opt-out” for all but the 54 complex banks choosing the “advanced approach” to regulatory capital. For those banks, Cole sums the losses on HTM and AFS and divided by CET1. For advanced banks, Cole divides the losses on HTM by CET1. For comparison, HTM loss divided by total equity capital is also presented.

Regulators would force a bank that lost half of its CET1 capital to take remedial actions, such as raising new capital or seeking a merger partner; in the worst case, a bank may face closure by the FDIC.

“Investors are well aware that it’s unlikely this situation will get better,” Cole said. “This is only one issue facing banks, as interest rates are also impacting the commercial real estate exposures for banks. It’s one leg of a three-legged stool that keeps getting shorter.”

"High Intake of Ultra-processed Foods Linked to Systemic Inflammation","In the U.S., ultra-processed foods account for about 60% of daily calorie intake. (Photo by Alex Dolce)

Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are industrially altered products – like soda, snacks and processed meats – packed with additives and stripped of nutrients. Hundreds of new ingredients, previously unknown to the human body, now make up nearly 60% of the average adult’s diet and almost 70% of children’s diets in the United States.

These products reduce nutritional value, extend shelf life, and tend to increase how much people consume. In the U.S., UPFs account for about 60% of daily calorie intake. High consumption of these foods has been linked to greater risks of obesity, cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, mental health issues, and even premature death.

New research from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine shows that people who consume the most UPFs have significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a sensitive marker of inflammation and a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease.

Until now, there have been limited data from nationally representative U.S. populations on the link between UPF intake and hs-CRP levels.

Results of the study, published in The American Journal of Medicine, show that participants consumed a median of 35% of their daily calories from UPFs, ranging from just 0% to 19% in the lowest group to 60% to 79% in the highest. After accounting for factors like age, gender, smoking, physical activity and other health indicators, researchers found that individuals in the highest UPF intake group (60% to 79% of daily calories) had an 11% higher likelihood of elevated hs-CRP levels compared to those in the lowest intake group. Even moderate UPF consumers (40 % to 59%) showed a 14% increase in likelihood. Those with 20% to 39% intake had a smaller, nonsignificant 7% increase.

The likelihood was especially high in certain groups. Adults aged 50 to 59 had a 26% higher risk of elevated inflammatory markers compared to those aged 18 to 29. Obesity contributed to an 80% higher risk compared to people with a healthy weight. Current smokers also had a higher risk (17%) than people who never smoked. Interestingly, individuals who reported no physical activity did not have a statistically significant increase in risk compared to those who met activity guidelines.

“These findings, based on a large and nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, clearly show that people who consume the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods have significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a key marker of inflammation,” said Allison H. Ferris, M.D., FACP, senior author, professor and chair of the FAU Department of Medicine. “These results carry important implications not only for clinical practice and public health strategies but also for future research aimed at understanding and reducing the health risks associated with ultra-processed food consumption.”

Researchers analyzed data from 9,254 U.S. adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, including diet, hs-CRP and other health factors. UPF intake was measured as a percentage of total calories and grouped into four levels. They used statistical methods, including logistic regression, to examine the link between UPF consumption and inflammation.

“C-reactive protein is produced by the liver, and the hs-CRP protein test is a simple, affordable and highly sensitive measure of inflammation as well as a reliable predictor of future cardiovascular disease,” said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. “We believe that health care professionals may wish to consider actively engaging with their patients about the risks of UPFs and benefits of increasing whole food consumption.”

The authors also highlight a significant rise in colorectal cancer rates in the U.S., particularly among younger adults. They suggest that increased consumption of UPFs may be a contributing factor, along with its potential role in several other gastrointestinal diseases.

Drawing a parallel to the history of tobacco, the authors note that it took decades for mounting evidence and the efforts of progressive health officials to lead to policies discouraging cigarette use. They believe a similar trajectory is likely for UPFs, with growing awareness eventually driving meaningful public health action.

“The multinational companies that produce ultra-processed foods are very influential, much like tobacco companies were in the past, so policy changes to promote whole foods and reduce UPF consumption may take time,” said Hennekens. “However, government efforts to reduce harmful additives, improve food labeling, and promote healthier options in programs and schools are important steps in the right direction. At the same time, health care providers should be aware of the challenges many people face in accessing affordable, healthier choices, which calls for a broader and coordinated public health response.”

"Seaweed Snare: Sargassum Stops Sea Turtle Hatchlings in Their Tracks","A leatherback hatchling navigates over sargassum on Juno Beach in July 2021. (Photo credit: Abbey M. Appelt, Florida Atlantic University)

Every year, sea turtles hatch on Florida’s beaches and make their way from the sand to the ocean – a critical journey that determines their chances of survival. As these hatchlings navigate obstacles such as artificial lights, beach debris and predators like birds and crabs, a new hazard looms. Sargassum seaweed washing up on Florida’s shores in record amounts is more than just a nuisance for beachgoers – it’s becoming a serious threat to vulnerable sea turtle hatchlings.

While it’s long been known that obstacles on the beach can slow down hatchlings and put them at risk, little research has focused specifically on the impact of sargassum. A new study is beginning to fill that gap.

Researchers from Florida Atlantic University
                        ’s 
                        Charles E. Schmidt College of Science set out to explore whether sargassum buildup makes it more physically demanding for hatchlings to crawl to the ocean – and whether that added effort could affect their survival.

The study focused on three common species in Florida: leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea), loggerheads (Caretta caretta) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from three beaches – Juno Beach, Jupiter and Boca Raton.

Researchers created controlled crawlways on the sand to simulate a hatchling’s natural path to the water, adding loose mats of sargassum up to 19 centimeters high (about 7.5 inches) at the end of a 15-meter path. A dim light was placed several meters ahead to guide the hatchlings forward, simulating the natural light over the ocean that they instinctively follow. This method allowed them to directly measure the physical toll of crawling through sargassum and observe the hatchlings from a distance to avoid interfering with their natural behavior.

After completing the crawl, hatchlings had their blood glucose levels measured to assess energy use. Researchers also tested how quickly each turtle could flip itself upright when placed upside down in water – a simple test of physical condition. To account for environmental factors, researchers also recorded sand temperature at the beginning, middle and end of each crawl.

Results of the study, published in the Journal of Coastal Research, reveal that all three species of hatchlings took significantly longer to complete their crawl when sargassum was present, and the time it took to climb up and over the seaweed piles was the primary reason. Even with the lower heights (7-9 centimeters) tested in the study, some hatchlings – across all three species – were unable to complete the climb within the time limit.

Based on median values, leatherbacks took 54% longer to crawl through light sargassum and 158% longer through heavy sargassum. Loggerheads were slowed by 91% in the light sargassum treatment and 175% in the heavy treatment. Green turtles also saw delays of 75% in light sargassum and 159% in heavy. The crawl speed decreased sharply for all species in sargassum sections, with loggerheads showing the most significant slowdown.

“The longer a hatchling stays on the beach, the more at risk it becomes – not just from predators like birds and crabs, but also from overheating and dehydration, especially after sunrise,” said Sarah Milton, Ph.D., senior author and chair and professor, FAU Department of Biological Sciences. “When sargassum piles are higher – some can be over a meter high on South Florida beaches in the summer and extend for hundreds of meters down the beach – we can expect more failed attempts, particularly when hatchlings have to cross multiple bands of seaweed just to reach the ocean.”

The study also found that hatchlings often flipped upside down – referred to as “inversions,” while trying to climb the sargassum, especially in the heavy coverage trials. One hatchling flipped more than 20 times in a single trial. These inversions not only extended the time hatchlings spent on the beach but also increased their risk of predation and heat exposure.

Interestingly, despite these delays and the physical challenges of navigating the seaweed, the study found no significant differences in blood glucose levels between the hatchlings that crawled through sargassum and those that didn’t, across all three species. Glucose concentrations remained within expected ranges, suggesting that while the added obstacle increased the effort and risk, it didn’t immediately deplete their measurable energy stores. Only leatherbacks in the no-crawl control group had noticeably higher glucose levels, indicating that the act of crawling in general, rather than the sargassum itself, has the stronger physiological impact – at least in the short term.

“For sea turtle hatchlings, reaching the ocean is already a race against time – and survival. Now, increasingly large mats of sargassum are adding new challenges to this critical journey,” said Milton. “As these seaweed accumulations grow taller and more widespread, they risk blocking hatchlings entirely, draining their limited energy or leaving them stranded. Beyond impeding movement, sargassum may also reduce nesting space and alter incubation conditions.”

This growing issue calls for smarter, more responsive beach management strategies. Without action, these dense mats could quietly undermine hatchling success and, ultimately, long-term conservation goals.

"FAU Publishes Initial Annual Report: Florida Office of Ocean Economy","Housed at FAU, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries.

Few places in the world are as closely tied to the ocean as Florida. From our working waterfronts and bustling ports to fishing, tourism and recreation, the ocean is not just a natural asset; it is a cornerstone of our state’s economy and identity.

As such, in 2024 the Florida legislature selected Florida Atlantic University to house its Florida Office of Ocean Economy, a state effort to better understand, support and grow the ocean and coastal-based industries that drive jobs, investment and innovation across the state. FAU has published its initial annual report for the Florida Office of Ocean Economy.

Established by the Florida legislature in 2024 under the visionary leadership of the Florida legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries. Serving as a central hub for collaboration across business, research, capital and policy, the office is building the foundation for a thriving ocean economy.

“Florida Atlantic is proud to be the home of the state’s Office of Ocean Economy, a vital initiative advancing economic growth through the sustainable use of our ocean and coastal resources,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As a nationally recognized leader in marine science, ocean engineering and environmental research, Florida Atlantic is deeply committed to driving innovation, protecting ecosystems and preparing the next generation of talent. We look forward to working alongside our partners to cultivate an ocean economy that delivers opportunity, security and prosperity for every Floridian.”

Florida’s ocean economy is a vital and complex system that fuels prosperity across the state and serves as a cornerstone of its identity. With thousands of miles of coastline and a vibrant marine and coastal landscape, Florida supports a diverse set of industries that rely on healthy ocean resources, from ports and seafood to tourism and recreation. In 2023 alone, ocean-related activity sustained approximately 909,000 jobs, generated $59 billion in labor income and contributed $96 billion in Gross State Product. This represents more than 6% of the state’s total economic output, making Florida not only the largest ocean economy by employment in the United States, but also one of the most ocean-dependent economies in the world.

Florida’s ocean economy is guided by a robust framework of state initiatives and programs that sustain the economic productivity of coastal regions while protecting vital marine resources. From strategic port investments and aquaculture development to coastal resilience and beach renourishment, the state’s policy architecture enables Florida to lead the nation in ocean-related employment and economic activity.

The Florida Office of Ocean Economy will continue to collaborate closely with a diverse network of partners across sectors and disciplines. Key partners include state agencies and academic institutions such as the Florida Institute of Oceanography and other universities; federally funded research centers; industry leaders in marine transportation, tourism, aquaculture and renewable energy; nonprofit organizations focused on ocean conservation; federal agencies including NOAA and the U.S. Department of Energy; and private sector innovators driving marine technology and infrastructure development. This broad coalition strengthens Florida’s ocean economy by aligning resources, expertise and strategic vision toward sustainable growth and resilience.
