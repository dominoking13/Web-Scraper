"College of Nursing Receives $1.8M Gift from Mark Bruce Swillinger","Mark Bruce Swillinger has donated a $1.5 million gift to Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing in memory of his late wife, Marilyn Lee Swillinger, to establish an endowed professorship in hospice and palliative care nursing.

Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing has received a $1.5 million gift from Mark Bruce Swillinger in memory of his wife, Marilyn Lee Swillinger, to establish an endowed professorship in hospice and palliative care nursing. The Mark Bruce and Marilyn Lee Swillinger Endowed Professor will expose nursing students to specialized studies in hospice and palliative care throughout their nursing education. Additional gifts totaling $300,000 name the dean’s conference room for Marilyn Lee Swillinger, and the collaborative classroom for Mark and Marilyn together.

Marilyn Lee Swillinger, who passed away on Oct. 30, 2023, after a two-year battle with lung cancer, was especially passionate about supporting health care and the arts. She was a longtime member of the College of Nursing’s advisory board and supported other FAU colleges and departments, in addition to numerous other local charitable organizations.

“This is my opportunity to memorialize Marilyn and give back to the community, which has given so much to us,” said Mark Swillinger. “I can’t say enough about the treatment that hospice gave to Marilyn and me. It’s important not only to the people in need but also for everyone within our community.”

The Mark Bruce and Marilyn Lee Swillinger Endowed Professorship in Hospice and Palliative Care Nursing will provide support in perpetuity for a professor with expertise in hospice and palliative care who will direct the integration of this nursing specialty into the undergraduate curriculum that includes academics, simulation, clinical training, and preparation for certification in all levels in hospice and palliative care. This professor will also introduce students to this important specialty early in their academic careers and promote and prepare them for rewarding careers in hospice and palliative care.

“Our region faces critical shortages in nursing and health care, and this generous gift will have a lasting impact on the university and the communities we serve,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “Through their involvement and support over the years, Mark and Marilyn truly embraced Florida Atlantic as their hometown university. We are grateful that Mark chose to establish this meaningful legacy in memory of Marilyn in our College of Nursing.”

The need for hospice and palliative care is especially acute in Florida as more than 21% of state residents are age 65 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a number expected to grow to 27% by 2030. And the overall need for nurses continues to be crucial. FAU’s College of Nursing will be the first in the region to offer such a program focused on hospice and palliative care.

“As a member of the College of Nursing’s first advisory board, Marilyn had a profound influence on the college, helping it grow to what it is today,” said Cameron Duncan, Ph.D., DNP, Holli Rockwell Trubinsky Eminent Dean of Nursing. “Hospice and palliative care are so important to the community, and so many lives are going to be impacted because of Mark’s generosity.”

"FAU Kicks Off Construction of Wallach Building","From left, FAU President Adam Hasner; FAU benefactor Marilyn Wallach; Mark Wallach; and Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters at FAU, celebrate the start of construction of the Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Holocaust and Jewish Studies Building.

Florida Atlantic University celebrated the start of construction of its Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Holocaust and Jewish Studies Building. The 22,000-square-foot, two-story structure will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Holocaust education, Jewish studies and related programs. It also will become a South Florida destination for visitors seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust, including cultural performances, lectures and exhibits that further understanding and respect for humanity. Construction is expected to take approximately 14 months with a targeted opening of fall 2026.

“This is a monumental day, and I know Kurt would be so proud to see this building become a reality,” said Marilyn Wallach. Kurt Wallach died in 2021, a year after the couple made a transformational $20 million gift to FAU to create the Kurt and Marilyn Wallach Institute for Holocaust and Jewish Studies, with a portion used as the lead gift to construct the Wallach building.

“Kurt always said, “We speak for those who cannot speak, and we remember all the victims, including our family members who perished needlessly,” Marilyn Wallach said. “It is our hope that through education we can ensure that lives will be saved, and history will not be repeated.”

More than 100 guests gathered for the kickoff celebration, including numerous other donors who have followed the Wallachs’ lead by making additional gifts in support of the building and its programs.

“The work we undertake today will stand as a national model of how a university can lead with principle and act with purpose,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As some universities across the nation struggle to confront antisemitism, the Wallach building rises from a profound responsibility that calls to us with urgency. We are taking steps to become the safest and most welcoming university for Jewish life in America, and we are honored that Kurt and Marilyn Wallach’s story has become part of our legacy here at Florida Atlantic.”

The Wallach building will be the home of Florida Atlantic’s Arthur and Emalie Gutterman Family Center for Holocaust and Human Rights Education; Holocaust education and Jewish studies programs; the Leon Charney Diplomacy program; and the Center for Peace, Justice and Human Rights, all housed within the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters.

It also will be a South Florida destination for people seeking first-hand knowledge about the Holocaust as they tour the building’s permanent exhibits − the Craig and Barbara Weiner Holocaust Museum of South Florida at Florida Atlantic University and the George and Irina Schaeffer Dimensions in Testimony interactive display. Visitors also can spend time in quiet reflection within the Marta and Jim Batmasian Memorial Pavilion, which is dedicated to the memory of 1.5 million Armenians who died in the Armenian genocide.

The building also will feature a recital/lecture hall and a traveling exhibition hall off the prominent Marilyn and Jay Weinberg Grand Lobby. On the second floor, there will be a conference room, student study space and administrative offices for the programs.

“This wonderful building unleashes opportunities for both students and the community who will learn from the past to create a better world for the future,” said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters. “We are indebted to Kurt and Marilyn for their transformational lead gift to the building and to all the generous benefactors who have linked arms with us to make Florida Atlantic an epicenter of Holocaust and human rights education.”

"FAU/Baptist Health AI Spine Model Could Transform Back Pain Treatment","Nearly 3 in 10 adults in the U.S. have experienced lower back pain in any three-month period, making it the most common musculoskeletal pain.

Nearly 3 in 10 adults in the United States have experienced lower back pain in any three-month period, making it the most common musculoskeletal pain. Back pain remains one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting millions and often leading to chronic discomfort, missed work and invasive procedures.

Researchers and clinicians are increasingly turning to lumbar spine modeling, which bridges engineering and medicine, creating a virtual, patient-specific model of the lower back. This technology simulates how the spine moves, where mechanical stress builds up, and what might be causing pain or dysfunction.

These detailed models are used to plan surgeries, evaluate spinal implants and develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to each patient’s anatomy. Despite its promise, current lumbar spine modeling is slow, manual and demands specialized expertise, limiting scalability and personalization. This hinders clinical application and results in inconsistent outcomes.

Researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University and the Marcus Neuroscience Institute at Boca Raton Regional Hospital, part of Baptist Health, have reached a major milestone in lumbar spine modeling by integrating artificial intelligence with biomechanics to transform spine diagnostics and personalized treatment planning.

They are the first to create a fully automated finite element analysis pipeline specifically for lumbar spine modeling. Their breakthrough involves integrating deep learning tools like nnUNet and MONAI with biomechanical simulators such as GIBBON and FEBio.

Results of the study, published in the journal World Neurosurgery, show that this new approach reduced lumbar spine model preparation time by 97.9% – from more than 24 hours to just 30 minutes and 49 seconds – without compromising biomechanical accuracy. The fully automated pipeline enables rapid, patient-specific simulations that support preoperative planning, spinal implant optimization and early detection of degenerative spine conditions.

Tests showed that the virtual spine reacted just like a real one, with realistic disc movement, ligament tension and pressure in the back of the spine during bending and stretching. Because the system runs with very little manual work, it’s much faster and more consistent than traditional methods, making it a valuable tool for doctors and researchers alike.

“What sets our approach apart is its ability to automatically convert standard medical images like CT or MRI scans into highly accurate, patient-specific spine models,” said Maohua Lin, Ph.D., corresponding author and a research assistant professor, FAU Department of Biomedical Engineering. “Traditional manual methods require complex geometry processing, meshing and finite element simulation setup, making them not only time-intensive but also highly dependent on the operator’s expertise. Our automated pipeline significantly reduces the time required, cutting what once took several hours or even days down to just minutes.”

For the study, researchers used advanced AI to automatically identify important parts of the spine – like bones and discs – from medical scans. These were then turned into smooth 3D models that included bones, cartilage and ligaments. They mapped where the ligaments attach and shaped the cartilage based on common patterns. Lastly, researchers ran computer simulations to see how the spine responds to movements like bending and twisting, helping them understand where stress builds up and how the spine moves in real life.

“Beyond advancing research, automated lumbar spine modeling plays a critical role in preoperative planning,” said Frank D. Vrionis, M.D., corresponding author and chief of neurosurgery at Marcus Neuroscience Institute. “This technology quickly generates patient-specific models to predict mechanical complications, optimize implant design and reduce surgical risks. By removing manual steps, it also improves speed and consistency, helping clinicians make more informed decisions.”

This research builds upon previous work by the research team published in leading journals including Artificial Intelligence Review and the North American Spine Society Journal, investigating related AI-driven biomechanical modeling techniques.

“This groundbreaking work exemplifies the game-changing power of uniting engineering and medicine to address complex health care challenges,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science. “FAU and Baptist Health researchers are not only pushing the boundaries of innovation, they are also delivering real-world solutions that can improve patient outcomes and redefine spine care.”

Study co-authors are Mohsen Ahmadi, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; Xuanzong Zhang, an American Heritage High School student; Yufei Tang, Ph.D., an associate professor, FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and FAU Sensing Institute fellow; Erik Engeberg, Ph.D., a professor, FAU Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering, a member of the FAU Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute; and Javad Hashemi, Ph.D., inaugural chair and professor of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and associate dean for research, FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science.

This research was supported by Boca Raton Regional Hospital, part of Baptist Health, the Helene and Stephen Weicholz Foundation, the National Science Foundation, pilot grants from the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science, the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, the FAU Center for Smart Health, and the FAU Sensing Institute.

"Researchers Show How Healthy Habits Can Improve Cognitive Decline","Up to 45% of dementia risk is linked to modifiable factors like poor diet, inactivity and isolation.

An estimated 7.2 million Americans over age 65 currently live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). That number is expected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. These increases reflect more than demographic shifts; they point to a growing public health crisis that requires a new, proactive approach. While chronological age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive decline, losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging.

As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention.

In a commentary published in The American Journal of Medicine, the researchers urge clinicians, public health professionals and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts to support lifestyle-based interventions that can help reduce the growing burden of cognitive decline in the United States and worldwide.

“While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have surged by more than 140%,” said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. “At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.”

Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline. The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline – potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present.

The commentary highlights the recently published results from POINTER, the first large-scale U.S-based randomized trial to test whether intensive lifestyle changes can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults at high risk of decline. In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making. The intervention emphasized regular physical activity, a combination of Mediterranean and DASH-style diets, cognitive stimulation and social engagement – reinforced through ongoing professional guidance and group support.

These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits.

“The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes – previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer – also hold transformative potential for brain health,” Hennekens said.

The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease. Quitting smoking may help preserve brain structure and white matter integrity, and regular social and cognitive engagement promotes neuroplasticity and mental resilience.

“The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous,” said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine. “Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline – tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. Public health agencies could adopt the framework of trials like POINTER and FINGER to develop brain health programs.”

On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. Modeling studies suggest that reducing key risk factors by even 10% to 20% each decade could lower the burden of cognitive decline by up to 15%.

Beyond the health care system, the societal costs of dementia are staggering. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia – amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion. Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. The researchers emphasize that these realities underscore the need for practical, community-based solutions that support both patients and caregivers and reduce the long-term burden on families and the economy.

“While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health,” said Hennekens. “Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline.”

The first and corresponding author is John Dunn, a medical student at the Schmidt College of Medicine.

"Study: AI Agents Shift How Hotels Build Guest Loyalty","The rise of artificial intelligence agents will introduce a new layer of complexity in how the hospitality industry navigates customer loyalty, according to a conceptual paper, “Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents and the Future of Customer Loyalty,” from four researchers at Florida Atlantic University.

The rise of artificial intelligence agents will introduce a new layer of complexity in how the hospitality industry navigates customer loyalty, according to a conceptual paper, “Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents and the Future of Customer Loyalty,” from four researchers at Florida Atlantic University.

Before consumer reliance on AI, most hotels used brand awareness, search engine optimization, and other tools to cultivate customer loyalty. As AI agents and autonomous systems increasingly make travel decisions and bookings on behalf of consumers, hotels will need to rethink how they pursue and maintain customer loyalty and the guest experience.

“AI agents will be the new gatekeepers of loyalty,” said Anil Bilgihan, Ph.D., professor of hospitality management in FAU’s College of Business. “The question is no longer just ‘How do we win a customer’s heart?’ but ‘How do we win the trust of the algorithms that are advising them?’ Hotels need to prepare for a future where a guest’s preferred brand may be decided before the guest even opens their phone.”

The paper was published in the International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, with authors Max Ostinelli, Ph.D., assistant professor of marketing; Ye Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of hospitality and management; Melanie Lorenz, Ph.D., associate professor of marketing; along with Bilgihan.

The shift to AI agents will offload many of the decisions consumers make, instead placing them under the control of autonomous AI agents as they become the primary interface for travel decisions, researchers said. As consumers rely on these agents to search for hotels within their travel preferences, check room availability, pricing trends, review sentiment and make bookings on their behalf, the decision-making process for hotels and travel will come from the algorithm, leading to loyalty to the agent or its ecosystem rather than loyalty to the brand.

“Imagine a traveler asking their AI agent to book a hotel in Miami within a certain budget, with a pool and strong reviews,” Bilgihan said. “The AI is not swayed by traditional advertising; it sorts options based on algorithmic criteria. If your hotel doesn’t surface in that recommendation set, you may never even be considered. This means hotels must design loyalty programs, digital visibility and service experiences that appeal simultaneously to human guests and the AI systems filtering choices on their behalf.”

The paper suggests a framework for hotels and the broader hospitality industry to rethink loyalty strategies as autonomous AI agents become the primary way of engaging and booking travel. While emotional branding still matters for human consumers, marketers must prioritize loyalty programs appealing to both humans and AI systems. Researchers suggest using customer data to tailor experiences while at the hotel, algorithmic visibility, and creating loyalty programs appealing to AI and human users.

“Let’s just take Florida, for example. We welcomed over 34 million visitors this summer alone, and that surge, in combination with technological advances, is rewriting the rules of hospitality,” Lorenz said. “To keep up this trend and stay visible in the future, loyalty must be emotionally resonant, algorithmically relevant, and strategically designed for both human travelers and autonomous agents. AI agents are no longer behind-the-scenes helpers; they’re becoming the architects of guest experience. Hotels that design experiences for both human guests and digital decision-makers will lead the next wave of personalized, predictive hospitality.”

Researchers also warned about potential ethical and privacy concerns in the future, highlighting algorithmic bias as some AI systems may be trained on certain data over others, a lack of understanding on the part of consumers as to how AI agents work and brand visibility challenges.

“At the end of the day, technology doesn’t replace the fundamentals,” Bilgihan said. “No algorithm can cover up for a disappointing stay. AI might shape how guests discover and book, but the foundation of loyalty will always be exceptional customer experience once they arrive. Hotels that combine operational excellence with digital fluency will be best positioned to thrive.”

Pre-show events will be held one hour before the performances. Activities include free creative writing workshops for students in grades 4–12 on Saturdays at 2 p.m.; “S’mores Saturdays” with free s’mores on the patio at 6 p.m.; and “Crafty Sundays” at 2 p.m. with arts and crafts on the patio.

The production also serves as the centerpiece of The Future PAGES Project, which offers free in-school creative writing workshops and field trips for students in grades 4–12 across Palm Beach and Broward counties. Since its launch in 2015, the program has served more than 12,000 students at no cost.

“Our program starts with a visit to partner schools, where we provide a writing workshop to help students identify and utilize the parts of a story,” said Jill Carr, Theatre Lab’s director of education and community outreach. “This year’s theme is ‘Nothing to Fear,’ and we’re excited to read the dynamic and surprising stories the show and program will inspire.”

"FAU Publishes Initial Annual Report: Florida Office of Ocean Economy","Housed at FAU, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries.

Few places in the world are as closely tied to the ocean as Florida. From our working waterfronts and bustling ports to fishing, tourism and recreation, the ocean is not just a natural asset; it is a cornerstone of our state’s economy and identity.

As such, in 2024 the Florida legislature selected Florida Atlantic University to house its Florida Office of Ocean Economy, a state effort to better understand, support and grow the ocean and coastal-based industries that drive jobs, investment and innovation across the state. FAU has published its initial annual report for the Florida Office of Ocean Economy.

Established by the Florida legislature in 2024 under the visionary leadership of the Florida legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries. Serving as a central hub for collaboration across business, research, capital and policy, the office is building the foundation for a thriving ocean economy.

“Florida Atlantic is proud to be the home of the state’s Office of Ocean Economy, a vital initiative advancing economic growth through the sustainable use of our ocean and coastal resources,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As a nationally recognized leader in marine science, ocean engineering and environmental research, Florida Atlantic is deeply committed to driving innovation, protecting ecosystems and preparing the next generation of talent. We look forward to working alongside our partners to cultivate an ocean economy that delivers opportunity, security and prosperity for every Floridian.”

Florida’s ocean economy is a vital and complex system that fuels prosperity across the state and serves as a cornerstone of its identity. With thousands of miles of coastline and a vibrant marine and coastal landscape, Florida supports a diverse set of industries that rely on healthy ocean resources, from ports and seafood to tourism and recreation. In 2023 alone, ocean-related activity sustained approximately 909,000 jobs, generated $59 billion in labor income and contributed $96 billion in Gross State Product. This represents more than 6% of the state’s total economic output, making Florida not only the largest ocean economy by employment in the United States, but also one of the most ocean-dependent economies in the world.

Florida’s ocean economy is guided by a robust framework of state initiatives and programs that sustain the economic productivity of coastal regions while protecting vital marine resources. From strategic port investments and aquaculture development to coastal resilience and beach renourishment, the state’s policy architecture enables Florida to lead the nation in ocean-related employment and economic activity.

The Florida Office of Ocean Economy will continue to collaborate closely with a diverse network of partners across sectors and disciplines. Key partners include state agencies and academic institutions such as the Florida Institute of Oceanography and other universities; federally funded research centers; industry leaders in marine transportation, tourism, aquaculture and renewable energy; nonprofit organizations focused on ocean conservation; federal agencies including NOAA and the U.S. Department of Energy; and private sector innovators driving marine technology and infrastructure development. This broad coalition strengthens Florida’s ocean economy by aligning resources, expertise and strategic vision toward sustainable growth and resilience.
