"FAU Engineers Create Smarter AI to Redefine Control in Complex Systems","A new AI framework improves management of complex systems with unequal decision-makers, like smart grids, traffic networks, and autonomous vehicles. A new artificial intelligence breakthrough developed by researchers in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University offers a smarter, more efficient way to manage complex systems that rely on multiple decision-makers operating at different levels of authority. This novel framework, recently published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems, could significantly impact the future of smart energy grids, traffic networks and autonomous vehicle systems – technologies that are becoming increasingly central to daily life. In many real-world systems, decisions don’t happen simultaneously or equally. A utility company might decide when to cut power during peak hours, and households must adjust their energy use in response. In traffic systems, central controllers dictate signals while vehicles adapt accordingly. “These types of systems operate under a power hierarchy, where one player makes the first move and others must follow, and they’re more complicated than typical AI models assume,” said Zhen Ni, Ph.D., senior author, IEEE senior member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Traditional AI methods often treat every decision-maker as equal, operating at the same time with the same level of influence. While this makes for clean simulations, it doesn’t reflect how decisions are actually made in real-world scenarios – especially in environments full of uncertainty, limited bandwidth and uneven access to information.” To address this, Ni and Xiangnan Zhong, Ph.D., first author, IEEE member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, designed a new AI framework based on reinforcement learning, a technique that allows intelligent agents to learn from interacting with their environment over time. Their approach adds two key innovations. First, it structures the decision-making process using a game theory model called the Stackelberg-Nash game, where a “leader” agent acts first and “follower” agents respond in an optimal way. This hierarchy better mirrors systems like energy management, connected transportation and autonomous driving. Second, the researchers introduced an event-triggered mechanism that reduces the computational burden. “Instead of constantly updating decisions at every time step, which is typical of many AI systems, our method updates decisions only when necessary, saving energy and processing power while maintaining performance and stability,” said Zhong. The result is a system that not only handles the power asymmetry between decision-makers but also deals with mismatched uncertainties – cases where different players operate with varying levels of information and predictability. This is especially critical in environments like smart grids or traffic control systems, where conditions change rapidly and resources are often limited. The framework allows for a more robust, adaptive and scalable form of AI control that can make better use of limited bandwidth and computing resources. “This work fills a crucial gap in the current AI landscape. By developing a method that reflects real-world decision hierarchies and adapts to imperfect information, Professors Zhong and Ni are helping us move closer to practical, intelligent systems that can handle the complexity of our modern infrastructure,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “The implications of this research are far-reaching. Whether it’s optimizing power consumption across cities or making autonomous systems more reliable, this kind of innovation is foundational to the future of intelligent technology. It represents a step forward not just for AI research, but for the everyday systems we depend on.” Backed by rigorous theoretical analysis and validated through simulation studies, Zhong and Ni demonstrated that their event-triggered reinforcement learning method maintains system stability, ensures optimal strategy outcomes and effectively reduces unnecessary computation. The approach combines deep control theory with practical machine learning, offering a compelling path forward for intelligent control in asymmetric, uncertain environments. Two related journal articles have recently been published on IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence as well. The research work is mainly supported by the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Transportation. The research team is now working on expanding their model for larger-scale testing in real-world scenarios. Their long-term vision is to integrate this AI framework into operational systems that power cities, manage traffic and coordinate fleets of autonomous machines – bringing the promise of smarter infrastructure one step closer to reality.

"Decoding a Decade of Grouper Grunts Unlocks Spawning Secrets, Shifts","A red hind grouper, which produces sounds associated with courtship, territoriality or mating. More than a decade of acoustic recordings of grouper grunts are providing new insight into how sound can be used to monitor and manage vulnerable fish populations. The research by Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute focused on the red hind (Epinephelus guttatus), a commercially important Caribbean grouper species. Red hind are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as females and later becoming males. Each winter, they travel more than 30 kilometers to offshore sites to spawn under the full moon in large gatherings. Males use rhythmic, low-frequency sounds to attract mates and to defend territory. This predictable behavior makes them especially vulnerable to overfishing during spawning season. Rather than traditional survey methods, FAU Harbor Branch and FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science researchers, in collaboration with HJR Reefscaping, the University of the Virgin Islands, and the University of Puerto Rico, turned to passive acoustic monitoring. This technique enables continuous, long-term monitoring of reproductive behavior, even in remote or hard-to-access areas, without disrupting the animals or their habitat. To examine how red hind reproductive behavior has changed over time, researchers analyzed more than 2,000 hours of underwater recordings from a single spawning site off Puerto Rico’s west coast, continuously monitored since 2007. Unlike most acoustic studies that track general sound levels, this research focused on specific mating calls tied to distinct behaviors. Red hind produce two primary sound types – one for courtship and another for territorial defense. Tracking these sounds over time allowed researchers to detect subtle shifts in spawning behavior and population dynamics. The result, published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, is one of the most extensive and uninterrupted acoustic datasets ever assembled for a reef fish species. The analysis confirmed a consistent seasonal pattern in red hind spawning activity, closely aligned with lunar cycles. However, one of the most striking findings was a notable shift in the balance of call types over the 12-year period. Between 2011 and 2017, calls linked to courtship were more common. But starting in 2018, calls linked to competition and territorial behavior became dominant – nearly tripling over the study period. “This shift could indicate changes in the population, such as an increase in the number of older or more dominant males, changes in sex ratios, or even a shift in the core spawning area,” said Laurent Chérubin, Ph.D., lead author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch. Researchers also observed more frequent and multiple peaks in sound production in recent years, suggesting that spawning may now be spread over more days in each lunar cycle than in the past. These changes could be responses to environmental or population shifts. Importantly, the study shows that passive acoustic monitoring can be a powerful tool for tracking reproductive behavior over time and detecting early signs of population or behavioral change – information that is critical for managing and conserving red hind and similar reef fish species. “What’s remarkable is that even a single underwater microphone can reveal so much about fish populations,” said Chérubin. “With consistent long-term monitoring, we can pick up early warning signs – like shifts in spawning behavior or population stress – and give resource managers the information they need to adapt conservation strategies before it’s too late.” At the center of the analysis was an advanced machine-learning tool called FADAR (fish acoustic detection algorithm research). This custom-built acoustic classifier allowed the team to detect and distinguish between different types of mating calls with extraordinary speed and accuracy. “This study shows how much we can learn simply by listening,” said Chérubin. “Thanks to FADAR, we processed 12 years of acoustic data in weeks – uncovering patterns that would have taken years to find. It’s a game changer for monitoring and managing reef fish like red hind.” “As passive acoustics advances, it’s transforming our understanding of the ocean,” said Chérubin. “By tuning in to underwater soundscapes, we’re discovering not just when and where fish spawn, but how those patterns change over time – offering vital insights into the health of marine ecosystems.” Study co-authors are Caroline Woodward, United States Geological Survey; Michelle Schärer-Umpierre, Ph.D., associate researcher, HJR Reefscaping and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez; Richard S.

"FAU/Baptist Health AI Spine Model Could Transform Back Pain Treatment","Nearly 3 in 10 adults in the U.S. have experienced lower back pain in any three-month period, making it the most common musculoskeletal pain. Nearly 3 in 10 adults in the United States have experienced lower back pain in any three-month period, making it the most common musculoskeletal pain. Back pain remains one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting millions and often leading to chronic discomfort, missed work and invasive procedures. Researchers and clinicians are increasingly turning to lumbar spine modeling, which bridges engineering and medicine, creating a virtual, patient-specific model of the lower back. This technology simulates how the spine moves, where mechanical stress builds up, and what might be causing pain or dysfunction. These detailed models are used to plan surgeries, evaluate spinal implants and develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to each patient’s anatomy. Despite its promise, current lumbar spine modeling is slow, manual and demands specialized expertise, limiting scalability and personalization. This hinders clinical application and results in inconsistent outcomes. Researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University and the Marcus Neuroscience Institute at Boca Raton Regional Hospital, part of Baptist Health, have reached a major milestone in lumbar spine modeling by integrating artificial intelligence with biomechanics to transform spine diagnostics and personalized treatment planning. They are the first to create a fully automated finite element analysis pipeline specifically for lumbar spine modeling. Their breakthrough involves integrating deep learning tools like nnUNet and MONAI with biomechanical simulators such as GIBBON and FEBio. Results of the study, published in the journal World Neurosurgery, show that this new approach reduced lumbar spine model preparation time by 97.9% – from more than 24 hours to just 30 minutes and 49 seconds – without compromising biomechanical accuracy. The fully automated pipeline enables rapid, patient-specific simulations that support preoperative planning, spinal implant optimization and early detection of degenerative spine conditions. Tests showed that the virtual spine reacted just like a real one, with realistic disc movement, ligament tension and pressure in the back of the spine during bending and stretching. Because the system runs with very little manual work, it’s much faster and more consistent than traditional methods, making it a valuable tool for doctors and researchers alike. “What sets our approach apart is its ability to automatically convert standard medical images like CT or MRI scans into highly accurate, patient-specific spine models,” said Maohua Lin, Ph.D., corresponding author and a research assistant professor, FAU Department of Biomedical Engineering. “Traditional manual methods require complex geometry processing, meshing and finite element simulation setup, making them not only time-intensive but also highly dependent on the operator’s expertise. Our automated pipeline significantly reduces the time required, cutting what once took several hours or even days down to just minutes.” For the study, researchers used advanced AI to automatically identify important parts of the spine – like bones and discs – from medical scans. These were then turned into smooth 3D models that included bones, cartilage and ligaments. They mapped where the ligaments attach and shaped the cartilage based on common patterns. Lastly, researchers ran computer simulations to see how the spine responds to movements like bending and twisting, helping them understand where stress builds up and how the spine moves in real life. “Beyond advancing research, automated lumbar spine modeling plays a critical role in preoperative planning,” said Frank D. Vrionis, M.D., corresponding author and chief of neurosurgery at Marcus Neuroscience Institute. “This technology quickly generates patient-specific models to predict mechanical complications, optimize implant design and reduce surgical risks. By removing manual steps, it also improves speed and consistency, helping clinicians make more informed decisions.” This research builds upon previous work by the research team published in leading journals including Artificial Intelligence Review and the North American Spine Society Journal, investigating related AI-driven biomechanical modeling techniques. “This groundbreaking work exemplifies the game-changing power of uniting engineering and medicine to address complex health care challenges,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science. “FAU and Baptist Health researchers are not only pushing the boundaries of innovation, they are also delivering real-world solutions that can improve patient outcomes and redefine spine care.” Study co-authors are Mohsen Ahmadi, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; Xuanzong Zhang, an American Heritage High School student; Yufei Tang, Ph.D., an associate professor, FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and FAU Sensing Institute fellow; Erik Engeberg, Ph.D., a professor, FAU Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering, a member of the FAU Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences within the Charles E.

"Researchers Show How Healthy Habits Can Improve Cognitive Decline","Up to 45% of dementia risk is linked to modifiable factors like poor diet, inactivity and isolation. An estimated 7.2 million Americans over age 65 currently live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). That number is expected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. These increases reflect more than demographic shifts; they point to a growing public health crisis that requires a new, proactive approach. While chronological age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive decline, losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging. As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention. In a commentary published in The American Journal of Medicine, the researchers urge clinicians, public health professionals and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts to support lifestyle-based interventions that can help reduce the growing burden of cognitive decline in the United States and worldwide. “While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have surged by more than 140%,” said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. “At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.” Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline. The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline – potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present. The commentary highlights the recently published results from POINTER, the first large-scale U.S-based randomized trial to test whether intensive lifestyle changes can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults at high risk of decline. In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making. The intervention emphasized regular physical activity, a combination of Mediterranean and DASH-style diets, cognitive stimulation and social engagement – reinforced through ongoing professional guidance and group support. These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits. “The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes – previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer – also hold transformative potential for brain health,” Hennekens said. The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease. Quitting smoking may help preserve brain structure and white matter integrity, and regular social and cognitive engagement promotes neuroplasticity and mental resilience. “The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous,” said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine. “Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline – tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. Public health agencies could adopt the framework of trials like POINTER and FINGER to develop brain health programs.” On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. Modeling studies suggest that reducing key risk factors by even 10% to 20% each decade could lower the burden of cognitive decline by up to 15%. Beyond the health care system, the societal costs of dementia are staggering. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia – amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion. Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. The researchers emphasize that these realities underscore the need for practical, community-based solutions that support both patients and caregivers and reduce the long-term burden on families and the economy. “While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health,” said Hennekens. “Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline.” The first and corresponding author is John Dunn, a medical student at the Schmidt College of Medicine.

"Research Characterizes Remarkable Skills of Octopus Arms in the Wild","An octopus raises its arm. (Photo credit: Chelsea Bennice, Florida Atlantic University) Octopuses are among the most neurologically complex invertebrates, famed for their extraordinary dexterity. Their eight arms allow them to capture hidden prey, communicate, explore, and even mate across varied habitats. Although octopus arms rank among some of the most flexible structures in nature, their full range of movement has rarely been studied in the wild – especially in a range of underwater habitats. A new study by Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, in collaboration with researchers from the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, provides a comprehensive look into how wild octopuses use their arms in natural habitats. By analyzing arm movements across diverse environments, this is the first study to relate arm movements to whole animal behaviors in complex, real-world settings. The findings, published this week in Scientific Reports, reveal that every arm is capable of performing all action types; however, there was a clear pattern of arm partitioning: front arms mainly use movements to aid in exploration, while back arms use movements that primarily support movement. Additionally, the octopuses demonstrated remarkable flexibility – single arms were shown to perform multiple arm movements simultaneously and different arm movements were coordinated across several arms, showcasing their complex motor control. “Observing them in the wild, we saw octopuses use different combinations of arm actions – sometimes just one arm for tasks like grabbing food, and other times multiple arms working together for behaviors like crawling or launching a parachute attack – a hunting technique they use to catch prey,” said Chelsea O. Bennice, Ph.D., lead author and a research fellow at FAU’s Marine Laboratory, Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. Researchers quantified nearly 4,000 arm movements from 25 video recordings of three wild octopus species observed in six distinct shallow-water habitats – five located in the Caribbean and one in Spain. They identified 12 distinct arm actions across 15 behaviors, each involving one or more of four fundamental arm deformations: shortening (arm length decreases), elongating (arm length increases), bending (arm curves) and torsion (twisting). “When octopuses move across an open environment, they skillfully use multiple arms to stay camouflaged from predators, such as the moving rock trick or looking like floating seaweed,” said Bennice. “Beyond foraging and locomotion, their arm strength and flexibility are essential for building dens, fending off predators, and competing with rival males during mating. These versatile abilities allow octopuses to thrive in a wide range of habitats.” In the nearly 7,000 observed arm deformations, all four types – bend, elongate, shorten and torsion – were seen in every arm. However, different regions of each arm – proximal (closest to the body), medial (middle section) and distal (tip) – were found to specialize in specific types of arm deformation, reflecting a sophisticated level of functional specialization; bends mostly occurred near the tips, whereas elongations were more frequent closer to the body. “I’m a strong believer that you have to get into the natural world, and especially the sensory world, of whatever animal you study,” said Roger Hanlon, Ph.D., co-author and senior scientist, Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. “The fieldwork is very arduous, and it takes a lot of luck to get valid natural behaviors.” The six octopus habitats in this study varied from smooth, sandy seafloor to highly complex coral reef environments. “Understanding these natural behaviors not only deepens our knowledge of octopus biology but also opens exciting new avenues in fields like neuroscience, animal behavior and even soft robotics inspired by these remarkable creatures,” said Bennice. Study co-authors are Kendra C. Buresch, a marine biologist; Jennifer H. Grossman; an undergraduate student, and Tyla D. Morano, all with the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole.

"High Intake of Ultra-processed Foods Linked to Systemic Inflammation","In the U.S., ultra-processed foods account for about 60% of daily calorie intake. (Photo by Alex Dolce) Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are industrially altered products – like soda, snacks and processed meats – packed with additives and stripped of nutrients. Hundreds of new ingredients, previously unknown to the human body, now make up nearly 60% of the average adult’s diet and almost 70% of children’s diets in the United States. These products reduce nutritional value, extend shelf life, and tend to increase how much people consume. In the U.S., UPFs account for about 60% of daily calorie intake. High consumption of these foods has been linked to greater risks of obesity, cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, mental health issues, and even premature death. New research from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine shows that people who consume the most UPFs have significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a sensitive marker of inflammation and a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease. Until now, there have been limited data from nationally representative U.S. populations on the link between UPF intake and hs-CRP levels. Results of the study, published in The American Journal of Medicine, show that participants consumed a median of 35% of their daily calories from UPFs, ranging from just 0% to 19% in the lowest group to 60% to 79% in the highest. After accounting for factors like age, gender, smoking, physical activity and other health indicators, researchers found that individuals in the highest UPF intake group (60% to 79% of daily calories) had an 11% higher likelihood of elevated hs-CRP levels compared to those in the lowest intake group. Even moderate UPF consumers (40 % to 59%) showed a 14% increase in likelihood. Those with 20% to 39% intake had a smaller, nonsignificant 7% increase. The likelihood was especially high in certain groups. Adults aged 50 to 59 had a 26% higher risk of elevated inflammatory markers compared to those aged 18 to 29. Obesity contributed to an 80% higher risk compared to people with a healthy weight. Current smokers also had a higher risk (17%) than people who never smoked. Interestingly, individuals who reported no physical activity did not have a statistically significant increase in risk compared to those who met activity guidelines. “These findings, based on a large and nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, clearly show that people who consume the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods have significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a key marker of inflammation,” said Allison H. Ferris, M.D., FACP, senior author, professor and chair of the FAU Department of Medicine. “These results carry important implications not only for clinical practice and public health strategies but also for future research aimed at understanding and reducing the health risks associated with ultra-processed food consumption.” Researchers analyzed data from 9,254 U.S. adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, including diet, hs-CRP and other health factors. UPF intake was measured as a percentage of total calories and grouped into four levels. They used statistical methods, including logistic regression, to examine the link between UPF consumption and inflammation. “C-reactive protein is produced by the liver, and the hs-CRP protein test is a simple, affordable and highly sensitive measure of inflammation as well as a reliable predictor of future cardiovascular disease,” said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. “We believe that health care professionals may wish to consider actively engaging with their patients about the risks of UPFs and benefits of increasing whole food consumption.” The authors also highlight a significant rise in colorectal cancer rates in the U.S., particularly among younger adults. They suggest that increased consumption of UPFs may be a contributing factor, along with its potential role in several other gastrointestinal diseases. Drawing a parallel to the history of tobacco, the authors note that it took decades for mounting evidence and the efforts of progressive health officials to lead to policies discouraging cigarette use. They believe a similar trajectory is likely for UPFs, with growing awareness eventually driving meaningful public health action. “The multinational companies that produce ultra-processed foods are very influential, much like tobacco companies were in the past, so policy changes to promote whole foods and reduce UPF consumption may take time,” said Hennekens. “However, government efforts to reduce harmful additives, improve food labeling, and promote healthier options in programs and schools are important steps in the right direction. At the same time, health care providers should be aware of the challenges many people face in accessing affordable, healthier choices, which calls for a broader and coordinated public health response.” Study co-authors are Kevin Sajan, a medical student at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine; Nishi Anthireddy, a medical student at FAU; Alexandra Matarazzo, a medical student at FAU; and Caio Furtado, M.D., a resident physician in FAU’s internal medicine residency program.

"Seaweed Snare: Sargassum Stops Sea Turtle Hatchlings in Their Tracks","A leatherback hatchling navigates over sargassum on Juno Beach in July 2021. (Photo credit: Abbey M. Appelt, Florida Atlantic University) Every year, sea turtles hatch on Florida’s beaches and make their way from the sand to the ocean – a critical journey that determines their chances of survival. As these hatchlings navigate obstacles such as artificial lights, beach debris and predators like birds and crabs, a new hazard looms. Sargassum seaweed washing up on Florida’s shores in record amounts is more than just a nuisance for beachgoers – it’s becoming a serious threat to vulnerable sea turtle hatchlings. While it’s long been known that obstacles on the beach can slow down hatchlings and put them at risk, little research has focused specifically on the impact of sargassum. A new study is beginning to fill that gap. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University ’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science set out to explore whether sargassum buildup makes it more physically demanding for hatchlings to crawl to the ocean – and whether that added effort could affect their survival. The study focused on three common species in Florida: leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea), loggerheads (Caretta caretta) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from three beaches – Juno Beach, Jupiter and Boca Raton. Researchers created controlled crawlways on the sand to simulate a hatchling’s natural path to the water, adding loose mats of sargassum up to 19 centimeters high (about 7.5 inches) at the end of a 15-meter path. A dim light was placed several meters ahead to guide the hatchlings forward, simulating the natural light over the ocean that they instinctively follow. This method allowed them to directly measure the physical toll of crawling through sargassum and observe the hatchlings from a distance to avoid interfering with their natural behavior. After completing the crawl, hatchlings had their blood glucose levels measured to assess energy use. Researchers also tested how quickly each turtle could flip itself upright when placed upside down in water – a simple test of physical condition. To account for environmental factors, researchers also recorded sand temperature at the beginning, middle and end of each crawl. Results of the study, published in the Journal of Coastal Research, reveal that all three species of hatchlings took significantly longer to complete their crawl when sargassum was present, and the time it took to climb up and over the seaweed piles was the primary reason. Even with the lower heights (7-9 centimeters) tested in the study, some hatchlings – across all three species – were unable to complete the climb within the time limit. Based on median values, leatherbacks took 54% longer to crawl through light sargassum and 158% longer through heavy sargassum. Loggerheads were slowed by 91% in the light sargassum treatment and 175% in the heavy treatment. Green turtles also saw delays of 75% in light sargassum and 159% in heavy. The crawl speed decreased sharply for all species in sargassum sections, with loggerheads showing the most significant slowdown. “The longer a hatchling stays on the beach, the more at risk it becomes – not just from predators like birds and crabs, but also from overheating and dehydration, especially after sunrise,” said Sarah Milton, Ph.D., senior author and chair and professor, FAU Department of Biological Sciences. “When sargassum piles are higher – some can be over a meter high on South Florida beaches in the summer and extend for hundreds of meters down the beach – we can expect more failed attempts, particularly when hatchlings have to cross multiple bands of seaweed just to reach the ocean.” The study also found that hatchlings often flipped upside down – referred to as “inversions,” while trying to climb the sargassum, especially in the heavy coverage trials. One hatchling flipped more than 20 times in a single trial. These inversions not only extended the time hatchlings spent on the beach but also increased their risk of predation and heat exposure. Interestingly, despite these delays and the physical challenges of navigating the seaweed, the study found no significant differences in blood glucose levels between the hatchlings that crawled through sargassum and those that didn’t, across all three species. Glucose concentrations remained within expected ranges, suggesting that while the added obstacle increased the effort and risk, it didn’t immediately deplete their measurable energy stores. Only leatherbacks in the no-crawl control group had noticeably higher glucose levels, indicating that the act of crawling in general, rather than the sargassum itself, has the stronger physiological impact – at least in the short term. “For sea turtle hatchlings, reaching the ocean is already a race against time – and survival. Now, increasingly large mats of sargassum are adding new challenges to this critical journey,” said Milton. “As these seaweed accumulations grow taller and more widespread, they risk blocking hatchlings entirely, draining their limited energy or leaving them stranded. Beyond impeding movement, sargassum may also reduce nesting space and alter incubation conditions.” This growing issue calls for smarter, more responsive beach management strategies. Without action, these dense mats could quietly undermine hatchling success and, ultimately, long-term conservation goals. Study co-author is Abbey M.

Her extraordinary achievements continue to inspire the scientific community, demonstrating how dedication, innovation and collaboration can unlock the therapeutic treasures hidden within our planet’s oceans,” said James M. Sullivan, Ph.D., executive director of FAU Harbor Branch. “This award is a fitting tribute to her remarkable career, and we are proud to have her as a cornerstone of our team.” Wright’s scientific journey began with a strong foundation in chemistry – earning her B.S. degree from California State University at Dominguez Hills and both her M.S. degree and Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of California at Riverside. Since then, she has established herself as a leading figure in marine natural products research, with a distinguished record of scientific achievement and leadership. She is the author of more than 100 peer-reviewed publications and six book chapters, contributing significantly to the fields of marine drug discovery and ocean exploration. As an inventor on 33 United States patents, she has helped define new therapeutic applications for compounds derived from marine organisms. Wright’s research has been supported by more than $25 million in externally awarded grants, which she has successfully managed to advance both basic and applied science. In recognition of her contributions, she was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors in 2017 and the ASP in 2018, and in 2022, she was elected president of the ASP. She received the prestigious Paul J. Scheuer Award in Marine Natural Products in 2024. Among Wright’s most notable scientific accomplishments is her co-authorship on the seminal paper describing the structures of ecteinascidins 729 and 743 – discoveries that enabled the clinical development of one of the first marine-derived anticancer drugs. This discovery ultimately led to the development of Trabectedin (Yondelis™), an FDA-approved drug used in more than 40 countries for treating recurring soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer. Building on this success, Wright’s laboratory has discovered and characterized more than 100 marine natural products with potent biological activities. Her team has identified compounds exhibiting a wide range of effects, from anti-mitotic and anti-inflammatory to antibiotic and antiparasitic properties. Some of the notable discoveries include leiodermatolide, a powerful anti-mitotic agent; neopeltolide, which targets mitochondria; dictyostatin, a mitotic spindle poison; and aphrocallistin, which selectively targets cancer cells with specific genetic mutations. In addition to isolating new compounds, Wright’s research has also delved into understanding their mechanisms of action. For instance, her work revealed that dictyostatin functions by stabilizing microtubules, a finding that has inspired ongoing research into its potential for treating Alzheimer’s disease. Since 1984, the marine biomedical team at FAU Harbor Branch has conducted 107 expeditions and explored more than 3,400 sites. More than 1,000 dives used the Johnson-Sea-Link manned submersibles and remotely operated vehicles to collect marine samples from deep and mesophotic water habitats. These efforts have yielded a collection of more than 32,000 marine macro-organisms – including algae and invertebrates – many of which are new to science and serve as a rich resource for ongoing research. “I’m truly honored and humbled to receive this recognition from the American Society of Pharmacognosy,” said Wright. “This award represents a significant milestone in my career and reflects the collective efforts of the many talented colleagues and collaborators I’ve had the privilege to work with over the years. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the impact of marine natural products research recognized in this way.” Supported by funding from NOAA, NSF and the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation, Wright’s program continues to expand the frontiers of marine exploration. An innovative online portal now provides public access to images, videos and detailed information on these samples, showcasing four decades of marine research. “The oceans have long been a remarkable source of natural products, many with significant pharmaceutical potential,” said Wright. “Our ongoing exploration of deep-water habitats has revealed an incredible diversity of compounds – both novel and familiar – with new activities that hold great promise for future drug development. The possibilities are vast, limited only by our imagination and determination to explore the unknown.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.","https://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/wright-farnsworth-asp-award.php"

"FAU Engineering Awarded USDA Grant for Smart Farming Breakthrough","Arslan Munir, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science within the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, has received an $827,533 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. This award will support Munir’s leadership of a groundbreaking, multi-institutional research project with FAU, Kansas State University and Purdue University, aimed at revolutionizing the future of precision agriculture through the development of an advanced edge/fog computing-based framework – called “FogAg” – to enable real-time, multi-layer sensing and analysis of how water and nitrogen levels together affect crop growth and yield. Agriculture faces mounting pressure to feed a growing population while protecting natural resources. Managing water and nitrogen – two vital yet often limiting crop inputs – is one of the greatest challenges. When mismanaged, they can reduce yields and harm the environment through runoff and waste. Existing smart agriculture tools often fall short in capturing and responding to these complex interactions in real time with the precision farmers need. Munir’s FogAg framework is designed to fill this technological and scientific gap. By integrating cutting-edge developments in edge/fog computing, cyber-physical systems, and multi-modal sensing, the project offers a scalable solution that can provide actionable insights into plant-soil dynamics. The research will explore new innovations across multiple domains – including architecture, sensing, machine learning and predictive modeling – to deliver a next-generation agricultural system that can interpret and respond to field data in near real-time. “Receiving this USDA grant is an important milestone in our pursuit of transformative agricultural technologies,” said Munir. “Our goal with FogAg is to create an intelligent, adaptable and energy-efficient framework that empowers farmers with the data they need to make timely, site-specific decisions. By capturing and analyzing the nuanced interactions between water and nitrogen stressors, we aim to not only increase crop yield and quality but also reduce the environmental impact of modern agriculture. This project represents our deep commitment to leveraging advanced computing systems in service of sustainable food production.” At the heart of FogAg is a novel, three-tiered cyber-physical architecture that spans IoT devices, fog computing nodes and cloud servers, enabling distributed processing and near real-time analytics. Supporting this architecture is Neuro-Sense, a reconfigurable system that facilitates energy-efficient signal and image processing for dynamically changing workloads in the field. The team will develop and deploy a multi-modal sensing platform that includes an economical and flexible LED-based multispectral imaging system, an innovative near-infrared point measurement sensor, and a novel frequency response-based dielectric soil sensor. “These tools will enable sensing above, below and within the plant canopy, capturing a comprehensive picture of crop and soil health,” said Munir. On the data processing front, the project will leverage advanced machine learning techniques, including a highly efficient convolutional neural network accelerator capable of analyzing complex image and sensor data streams. These insights will feed into tree-based predictive models that integrate real-time and historical data to generate site-specific, variable-rate prescriptions for fertilizer and irrigation – maximizing productivity while minimizing input waste. Beyond its scientific and technical contributions, the FogAg project is poised to make significant societal and environmental impacts. The integration of real-time water and nitrogen management strategies will not only enhance resource-use efficiency and reduce production costs but also help lower agriculture’s nitrogen footprint and associated environmental pollution. With both spatial and temporal scalability, the framework has potential applications ranging from large-scale industrial farms to urban and peri-urban agricultural systems. “This research epitomizes the kind of forward-thinking, impact-driven innovation at Florida Atlantic University,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “Professor Munir’s work is a great example of how engineering can lead transformative change in critical sectors like agriculture. The integration of smart technologies into farming practices not only addresses urgent global challenges around food security and sustainability but also reinforces our role as a leader in cross-disciplinary research with real-world impact.” In addition to its research agenda, the project will incorporate its findings into both undergraduate and graduate curricula, training the next generation of engineers and scientists in the practical application of smart agriculture technologies. This educational component ensures that the knowledge generated through the FogAg project will have lasting influence, seeding innovation well beyond the duration of the grant. Munir will be working closely with co-investigators Michell L. Neilsen, Ph.D.; Naiqian Zhang, Ph.D.; Paul Armstrong, Ph.D.; and Rachel L.V. Cott, Ph.D.; representing the departments of computer science, biological and agricultural engineering and agronomy at Kansas State University; as well as Ignacio Ciampitti, Ph.D., Department of Agronomy from Purdue University. This collaboration ensures that the FogAg framework will be designed with both technological sophistication and agronomic practicality.
