    "content": "NewsTreasure Coast Warming shelters open across Treasure Coast as temperatures drop into the 40s WPTV's Caleb Holder By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated VERO BEACH, Fla. — As temperatures dip into the 40s — and feel even colder with the wind chill — warming shelters across the Treasure Coast are opening their doors to help people experiencing homelessness escape the dangerous chill.At The Source in Vero Beach, about a dozen people are seeking warmth Friday night. It’s one of the few shelters in the area offering 24/7 refuge, while others open only during periods of extreme cold.For Lea Marie, the shelter offers not just warmth — but a bit of hope.“It is hard, you know, physically, mentally demanding,” she said.Lea has been in and out of homelessness since 2015, spending time in cities like Washington, D.C., and Chicago before coming to Florida.“I slept on the Blue Line train from Rosemont to O'Hare, back and forth,” she recalled. “To stay warm, I covered up in a trash bag.”While the cold is a regular challenge in northern cities, for many in South Florida, it’s unfamiliar — and unforgiving.To meet the need, several warming centers opened Friday evening across the region:St. Lucie County: Percy Peek Gym — opened at 5 p.m.Okeechobee County: Rite-Life Services — opened at 6 p.m.Indian River County: The Salvation Army — opened at 7 p.m.The Source (Vero Beach): fully open by 9 p.m.Even as the temperatures drop, The Source continues its mission beyond emergency response. CEO Anthony Zorbaugh says everyone who comes in is provided with a hot meal, a shower, and a safe place to sleep — including on their innovative “Dignity Bus.”“Individuals are able to get on the bus between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., 365 days a year,” Zorbaugh said. “Every single bus is built and outfitted by people coming out of homelessness.”The organization’s Dignity Bus program — a fleet of retrofitted buses with 20 beds each — is believed to be the first mobile emergency shelter program in the country.While temporary warming centers serve a vital purpose, Zorbaugh says The Source aims for something more lasting.“Doing it this way eradicates homelessness,” he said. “Being a service model, you’ll never eradicate anything — you’ll just have clean, well-fed people sleeping on park benches. And for us, that’s unacceptable.”For information about warming centers and shelter resources in your area, visit WPTV.com/weather or call 211 for assistance.",

About one-third of the funds are from county taxpayers, the rest from state and federal grants.Ash Beecher, Transit Administrator for Martin County, said they came to the decision after looking at free fare studies in St Lucie and Indian River County, both with an increase in ridership after offering free rides.Beecher said part of the formula for state block grants for transit is based on ridership.“As we remove these fares, our hope is that ridership will increase, as it has for many other transit services that went fare-free,” said Beecher. “ And as ridership increases, the block grant will also increase.”Marty operates 5 fixed routes, 14 buses, and 67 bus stops.Last year, County leaders said the service took in around $156,000 in fares.Since 2021, the county has seen a 66 percent increase in ridership, from around 73,000 riders annually to around 122,000 in 2025.WPTV spoke to rider Joshua Reed, who said he uses Marty 5 days a week. Reed said the change to free fares is convenient for the community.“That [fare] adds up over time. That's like $15 a week. That's $60 a month. I mean, that's a phone bill for a lot of people,” said Reed. For me, it's pretty convenient and I know for other people it would be too.”County leaders said the free rides will not impact taxpayers or this fiscal year's budget.",

The pause on funds has impacted 40-million people nationwide, including a large number of seniors.WATCH BELOW: 'I still check every day to see if I have something in there,' Shawn Ohearon tells WPTV Record number of seniors using SNAP in Palm Beach County WPTV's Joel Lopez has been looking into the impact and found that United Way of Palm beach County has been working on a 10-year Hunger Relief Initiative where they track various needs, while finding solutions.It uncovered since 2015 they've seen a 32.7% rise in seniors that are signing up for SNAP.That means the numbers went from 22,701 in 2015 to 30,000+ in 2024.\"First of all, you're on a fixed income, secondly, because you're an older person, you have more expenses, medical and that sort of thing,\" said senior Shawn Ohearon.He said he's used SNAP benefits for the last three years after he's struggled holding job due to disabilities from back and leg injuries.Ohearon showed WPTV the app he uses to access, his SNAP benefits that has a balance of zero.\"The government still has to straighten out before I can get my food stamps again but boy am I ever waiting,\" said Ohearon. \"I still check every day to see if I have something in there, but nothing.\" Consumer Need food?

I'm down to like my last two cans of chicken.\"He was at a walk up soup kitchen at Victory City Church in Riviera Beach with the help of St. George's Table.\"They're grateful and thankful that we're here doing what we do. The gift is in the giving, and we're glad to give and help people out,\" said Devon Brown with Victory City Church, who says he's seen many new faces in line for food.When WPTV arrived, we saw a wide range of age and demographic of people lined up for food.\"It definitely changed with the impact of these SNAP benefits being reduced, and people anticipating not having food. We've definitely had an uptick on people that come,\" said Brown.Brown tells WPTV that since SNAP benefits have been impacted, the turnout at the food drive has gone from 75-100 to 200 people.\"I've been struggling. I try to look for all the little bit of help I can get,\" said 72-year old Casper Ellick who was getting food from the church.Palm Beach County officials said there are 166,000 SNAP users in Palm Beach County.WATCH BELOW: Need food?

Her concern is what will happen long term with her budget as she's juggling the loss of food funds and the rising cost of living. She said she also just recently became the caretaker of her three grandchildren, which is what qualified her for SNAP.\"By me being a caregiver for them, they helped me get food stamps for them but how can I feed them if I don't get them?\" said Ttuff. \"I got them in school with no problem but they need to eat.\"United Way Palm Beach County numbers show there's been an increase of 90% of seniors that are in need of their grocery delivery program.It's for seniors in need who physically can't make it to grocery stores or food drives.In 2022-2023 they served 1,507 seniors, which increased to 2,868 in 2023-2024.United Way is reminding people in Palm Beach County to use its Food Finder website.

So even though we were losing, we were still getting the right touches,” said Crino.The girls knew they were better than their record showed, and the team's captains, Caitlin Crino and Mackenzi Vanzwieten, had a simple message.“We all love the sport and we love each other, and I think that together makes us a team,” said Vanzwieten.“No, it's not necessarily who’s the better team, but who wants it more will fight their hardest to win the match,” said Crino.One thing the Blazers are known for is their fighting spirit. From 2022 through 2024, the Blazers finished in second place in the state championship, and Head Coach Len Visser never feared.“The mindset that they have is unbelievable. They really have a mind for the game,” said Visser.Their skills and insight for the game shone at the end of the season as they went on a seven-game win streak, tore through the playoffs, and once again, for the fourth straight year, found themselves in the state championship.“This year was like the first year that we had to work together as a team. I feel like everyone stepped up. So, it was really exciting to see the work pay off,” said Vanzwieten..Oh boy, did it pay off in the state championship. The Blazers went on to beat St. Edward's in three straight sets, winning the school's first-ever state championship, which brought a surreal feeling.“We worked so hard coming in runner-up three years in a row, we knew we had it as long as we put in the work,\" said Vanzwieten.",

Niemczyk believes the answer is yes, and he would like to see red light cameras help with traffic enforcement. On Monday, the chief received an initial green light from the city council.\"People need to be held accountable for bad driver behavior, and this is definitely a way to do it so … full support,\" said Mayor Shannon Martin.Of the top 10 intersections that could get red light cameras, three are along Port St. Lucie Boulevard and three are along St. Lucie West Boulevard. This includes the No. 1 most dangerous intersection, located at Cashmere and St. Lucie West boulevards. The City Council will need to approve the red light camera ordinance on a second reading.Niemczyk told WPTV that it would then take some time before the cameras are procured and made operational.\"My mission is to make the city as safe as possible, so this is an option that we want to explore,\" Niemczyk said.",

WATCH BELOW: Suspect accused of making threats to churches Palm Beach Gardens man accused of posting mass shooting threats The tip said that after Iaboni was recently fired from his job, he had been posting concerning videos on social media.Investigators said one of the videos was posted on Nov. 4, but later deleted, and showed Iaboni saying that he was \"fired up\" and it was \"all kill shot.\"The affidavit said the video also showed Iaboni holding up his hands pretending to hold up a rifle toward the camera and making two \"pew\" sounds, mimicking the sound of a firearm shooting.Iaboni then said he planned to target \"mega churches\" and others that \"are and could potentially be dangerous,\" according to the affidavit.\"Christ Fellowship is on my list to hit also,\" the arrest report said. \"My end game is taking you out. ... It's not necessarily the people that are yelling that you need to be worried about, it's the quiet ones. It's the ones that no longer fear death. I expect death to come fast and very violent. Hopefully I go out fast.\"The affidavit said Iaboni made another threatening post on Nov. 7, where he said it was \"gonna look like a genocide.\"The arrest report said that they believed that Iaboni possessed firearms, and in 2023 was stopped by Florida Fish and Wildlife police, where they confronted him about discharging a firearm in a public place. Officials said that Christ Fellowship was having a large volunteer event on Nov. 9 and expected an additional 1,000 people at the church, in addition to their normal congregation.The report said that Iaboni lived about 1.5 miles from Christ Fellowship and, on Nov. 2, signed up for an event to learn more about the church. The affidavit said that church staff later notified Palm Beach Gardens police about Iaboni \"frequenting the Church lately.\" Iaboni faces a charge of written threats to kill or do bodily harm, which includes threats of a mass shooting or a terrorism threat. Online jail records show that Iaboni is being held on a $250,000 bond. Iaboni's public defender has not returned messages seeking comment. WPTV also attempted to reach Iaboni's family over the phone on Monday, but the line disconnected.Court records show that Iaboni has not yet entered a plea. His next hearing is set for Dec. 9.WPTV spoke to representatives of Christ Fellowship regarding the arrest.\"We have great relationships with local law enforcement,\" said Greg Reade, the executive director of communications at Christ Fellowship.During a phone call with WPTV, Reade said the 24,000-member church has a team that actively monitors for threats and uses local police, along with private armed security, to provide protection at events. The church also checks attendees' bags at events and runs background checks on those who serve the church, Reade said.According to Reade, Iaboni had attended the church but never served as a volunteer there.In this case, Reade emphasized that there were no active threats to Christ Fellowship beyond Iaboni's language in his videos. Reade said the church worked with law enforcement to ensure he was arrested before church on Sunday.\"We always tell people we want to be the safest place for them,\" Reade said.",

Residents react to impending cold snap Phil Giudice, who is originally from New York, came to Juno Beach for his daily bike ride in a sweatshirt and long sleeves. He said even though he used to think of 40 degrees as a warm winter day, he’s no longer sure if he’ll go out tomorrow because it’s too cold.“Your blood thins real quick here and then you can’t handle the cold at all anymore,” Giudice said.He said he came to the beach today because he wasn’t sure if he’d see the ocean tomorrow. Lisa Koslow, who was outside for a walk, said she might skip the walk tomorrow as well because it’s too cold. But she’s not frustrated about missing a day of walking because the weather is nice all year long. WPTV “Your blood thins real quick here and then you can’t handle the cold at all anymore,” Giudice said. “We live in paradise,” said Koslow. “I know some of the snowbirds get frustrated but I’m here all year around. So I enjoy the cool weather occasionally.”She said she’s most excited to wear sweaters and other warm-weather clothes. Alex and Letizia Garcia, who are married, said they brought a change of clothes in case it gets cold. They said they are hosting their friends from Canada and are a little disappointed it’s too cold to swim in the ocean.“They don’t get to experience the typical Florida experience because obviously you want to show them a good time,” said Letizia.Alex said he was hopeful it would get cold, but he was frustrated the cold weather won’t stay with forecasts expected to move back into the 60s.“It’s not even going to be cold enough to turn the heat on in the house,” said Alex.

'PHENOMENAL': Delray Beach boxer with prosthetic leg beats odds “All that work, the two and a half years, the weeks leading up to it,” Gonzalez said. \"It was phenomenal. Phenomenal.”WPTV reporter Victor Jorges first met Gonzalez in July when Gonzalez and his gym, The Phoenix Boxing Gym, were raising funds for a new prosthetic leg to help him move faster and train harder. Sports How this boxing gym is ensuring a member can keep standing strong Victor Jorges Last month, Gonzalez faced an able-bodied, more experienced, and heavier opponent — and won.“Be fast,” is what Gonzalez had to do, he told Jorges. \"In my hands, in my speed, in my thinking.\"“As soon as that bell rung and it was just me and him, all that completely washed away,” Gonzalez said. “The feeling of having my hand raised in that ring is like no other.\" WPTV Coaches at Phoenix Boxing Gym in Delray Beach say the moment was unforgettable.“I was chasing him around trying to get his wraps off his hands; he didn’t want to know,” said Michael Hockton, owner of The Phoenix. “I think he sleeps with that belt. It was superb.”For Gonzalez, this first victory in the ring proved what he’s known all along. He can compete on equal footing.“I am able to compete level to level with people who are two-legged,” Gonzalez said. “I feel like, with how I move, I move better than most people with two legs. My footwork is pretty decent.”Now, Gonzalez is looking ahead to 2026, filled with more fights — and more wins.“It went well, it went well,” he said with a smile.After WPTV’s first story on Julian aired, the community rallied to support Gonzalez’s $20,000 goal for a new prosthetic leg. So far, they’ve raised more than $2,000.“Thanks again to Channel 5 and Victor for giving us some exposure,” Hockton said. “We actually raised over $2,000 for his new prosthetic.”If you’d like to donate to Julian’s fund for a new prosthetic, find out more here.",

Walker Posted and last updated VERO BEACH, Fla. — Since 2009, Vero Beach Rowing has been making waves — but this month, it’s all about pulling hard on the oars without ever leaving dry land. Vero Beach Rowing’s youth team takes on marathon challenge to empower local kids On Saturday, Nov. 15, from 8 a.m. to noon, the nonprofit’s young athletes will push their limits during the 2025 Erg-a-thon. The annual fundraising challenge has them rowing the distance of a marathon — 26.2 miles — on indoor rowing machines called “ergs.” The goal? Raise $50,000 to support scholarships, equipment, travel, and training for the more than 60 middle and high schoolers in their youth program. Many of these rowers rely on financial assistance to cover costs, thanks to the generosity of donors and community partners such as the Children’s Services Advisory Committee of Indian River County, Quail Valley Charities, Wheels & Keels Foundation and the Indian River Community Foundation. Spectators are encouraged to cheer the athletes on at The Toffey Rowing Center, 310 Acacia Road, Vero Beach. Can’t make it in person?
