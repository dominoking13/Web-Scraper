That case from 2014 had nearly identical accusations but was dropped because of a lack of evidence.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Investigators uncover third case involving Okeechobee babysitter accused of poisoning children WPTV's Michael Hoffman has been following this case since her arrest, even confronting the suspect as she bonded out of jail.WPTV's Michael Hoffman has uncovered new documents that show a third investigation into the possible poisoning of a baby in the care of Adamo. The incident report from 2023 shows a healthy 2-month-old was picked up from Adamo's Okeechobee home after a day of babysitting. Parents took the baby to a friend's house before going home.They noticed abnormal breathing at the friend’s house, worsening when they got home. Documents showing that the 2-month-old “was a bit lethargic and not acting his normal self.\"Parents then noticed it was “as if the baby could not wake up.”They rushed him to the hospital, where staff found “the baby tested positive for opioids” and was airlifted to another hospital. After 2 doses of Narcan, the infant “has made a full recovery.”The investigation brought detectives to test the parents' bottles and formula for opioids, which all came back negative.At the friend’s house, “CSI took many samples and none showed trace amounts of opiates.”When they went to Adamo’s home — investigators “found the house to be very clean,” but documents show “No evidence was collected at the [Adamo’s] residence.”According to documents, investigators “could not discover where the source of the opiate originated from or how the child came into contact with it.”The case was then closed.Hoffman asked the sheriff’s office why Adamo’s house wasn’t tested in 2023, to which they responded the following:“Given recent events in the current [2025] case, the agency has initiated a review of all past cases involving Adamo. Updates will be provided if and when any new information regarding those cases becomes available.”Even with this latest case, investigators say there is a possibility for more investigations to come to light.

It will measure 60 feet in diameter and will sit on the west lawn, the same location as Trump’s last term.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Palm Beach approves larger Mar-a-Lago helipad, neighbors raise concerns “Will it make noise? Absolutely. These are very big helicopters and they do make noise,” said land use attorney Harvey Oyer III. “They’re very heavy, which is why we don’t want to land it on the grass.”Oyer said it will be used for security evacuation rather than daily travel and will be built to support Marine One’s weight.During the meeting, member Alexander Ives raised concerns about allowing temporary structures in the town, voting against the request. WPTV has listened to people with concerns about noise, which is nothing new for longtime resident Dave Kaminer.“We have constant helicopters flying up and down the coast,” said Kaminer.Kaminer, already hearing helicopters at midnight, hopes this won’t add to the noise.“We would hope that Mr. Trump or anybody else using that helicopter is not going to be out here at 2 o’clock in the morning waking people from their sleep and that they’ll be using it for the benefit of our country,” said Kaminer.Now, Mar-a-Lago representatives will apply for a building permit.Mar-a-Lago will pay for the helipad and it will be removed at the end of Trump’s presidency.

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyDelray Beach Delray Beach residents push back against new parking rates WPTV's Joel Lopez is on the ground, listening to the community's worries and seeking answers from city leaders regarding the future of parking in the area WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Delray Beach is seeing an increase in parking rates that began at the start of the month, and residents are already voicing their concerns over these changes.WATCH BELOW: 'If you start adding up parking, it almost becomes unaffordable,' Justin Ragazzine tells WPTV Delray Beach residents push back against new parking rates WPTV's Joel Lopez is on the ground, listening to the community's worries and seeking answers from city leaders regarding the future of parking in the area.One local resident, Justin Ragazzine, was out for a walk with his three French bulldogs when he shared his frustration about the new parking policy.\"We moved to Delray and all we talked about to our friends is all the free parking here and they took it away,” said Ragazzine. “I think free parking for residents is a big deal. I come to Atlantic Avenue two to three times a day; if you start adding up parking, it almost becomes unaffordable.”Ragazzine noted that he has cut back on parking downtown and opted to park farther away in spots that do not charge for parking. WPTV “Because I didn't want to go into paying $6 to $7 a day,” he explained. “You come here and you're spending your money anyway to be here, the restaurants, the beach. Let them park for free.”As of October, parking rates have increased along select streets and garages in the downtown area, with new time limits imposed on how long vehicles can stay parked. Rates are now $1.50 per hour in city garages — including Old School Square, Robert Federspiel, and iPic — $2 per hour for surface lots, and $3 per hour for metered side streets. Atlantic Avenue and A1A parking rates remain unchanged.Business owner Simone Mehlbaum shared her observations on the changes. “There was a guy that walked a mile to get a chicken salad, and he said he needed the exercise and he didn't want to pay,” she relayed.WATCH BELOW: 'Parking is going to cost money on Sundays really creates a barrier,' Corey Heyman says Parking price hike has local businesses worried about community impact Mehlbaum, who is the general manager at Purlife Cafe and Fitness Center off Northeast Second Avenue, stated that the new parking rates have posed challenges for both customers and employees.She said many are confused about the new pricing and meters, compiling to delays in parking at the garage adjacent to her business.“I think the message to the city is to be a little more friendly to tourists and employees,\" Mehlbaum explained. \"It’s hard to find employees because the rents are high, and parking you have to pay now.” Delray Beach Parking price hike has local businesses worried about community impact Vannia Joseph To help alleviate the impact on city workers, the city is offering employees a monthly parking permit for $10 as a way to navigate the new parking rates. Mayor Tom Carney addressed the growing concerns. “I don’t want to pay for parking, you don’t want to pay for parking, your viewers don’t want to pay for parking,” he said, acknowledging the \"growing pains\" associated with the new system, describing it as “nothing more than a user fee.”“We’re asking the people who are using the parking to pay for the parking,\" Carney emphasized. \"There’s really no reason for someone who doesn’t drive or doesn’t come downtown to have their tax dollars support the people who come to downtown to park, and not everyone that comes downtown is a resident.”WATCH BELOW: 'Renewing it every month, that's a little much too,' Employee Savanah Pienaar tells WPTV This is what workers are saying about Delray Beach's employee parking permits Carney further explained that one objective of the new time limits is to prevent cars from parking all day and to encourage more turnover of parking spaces.He mentioned that it's too early to assess the full impact of these new rates.However, the city plans to analyze the data over the next six months to decide what the final parking fees may look like.“The city needs the revenues; the residents need to make sure that their assets are being monetized properly,\" stated Carney. \"The way you do that is you charge for parking like everyone else is doing.\" Delray Beach This is what workers are saying about the city's employee parking permits Vannia Joseph For those concerned about the financial impact, the city is also offering annual parking permits for Delray Beach residents at a flat rate of just $12 for the entire year. Staff at the parking office told WPTV they've seen three times more residents applying for parking permits than October of last year.The end of the parking rate pilot program is April 2026.

WATCH: TSA workers represented by AFGE Local 558 say they are struggling TSA workers at Palm Beach International Airport struggle as shutdown continues Democrats are withholding their votes until Republicans agree to extend expiring health insurance subsidies, while Republican lawmakers and the White House refuse to negotiate until the government reopens.At Palm Beach International Airport, TSA workers represented by AFGE Local 558 say they are struggling as the shutdown takes its toll on federal employees. \"How we're going to get to work if we don't have the gas money to put gas in our cars?\" said Mickey Alston, vice president of PBI Airport and AFGE Local 558 Women's Fair Practices Coordinator.The situation is about to worsen for these workers. \"Saturday, the officers are going to have a paycheck of zero,\" said John Hubert, president of AFGE Local 558. Travel The government shutdown is starting to bite at US airports Simon Kaufman Healthcare at center of stalemateThe workers stood alongside Democratic representatives Lois Frankel and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, calling on Republicans to end the government shutdown. Healthcare remains the main reason for the political stalemate. \"We will not vote for a budget that cuts millions of people out of health care,\" Frankel said.Democrats are pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies. \"Florida has the most people on the ACA in the country,\" Frankel said. \"Without the ACA subsidies, it's going to be over $1,500 a month,\" Cherfilus-McCormick said.Carl Cascio, chairman of the Palm Beach County Republicans, believes healthcare discussions should happen after the government reopens with a short-term continuing resolution. \"Then let's sit down under normal conditions and negotiate what needs to be done,\" Cascio said.Both parties point fingersWhen asked whether their respective parties bear responsibility for the shutdown, both local political leaders defended their positions.\"The onus is on the Republicans to try to do a workaround so that we don't have catastrophic closures of key functioning parts of our federal government. Other than that, no,\" Cascio said.\"We've been coming to work. Speaker of the House has not called the session in weeks. We have a president who's willing to talk to Putin, he's willing to talk to Hamas, but he's not willing to talk to us,\" Frankel said.Republican Representative Brian Mast criticized Democrats in a statement, saying: \"Did they vote to fund the government? No. Will they vote to pay TSA or any other federal workers? No. Will they vote to pay the military? No. Democrats need to stop using the very workers they are refusing to pay for political points. Enough is enough.\" Frankel responded to Mast's criticism.\"First of all, that's his opinion. If they put a bill on the floor and brought a safe to vote to pay for federal workers, I can guarantee you I would vote for that,\" Frankel said.But until both sides come together, federal workers continue to face uncertainty. \"Everybody is worried about what's going to happen next,\" Hubert said. \"We just need to get paid.\" This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

    "content": "NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin County Stuart city manager controversy: Resident now calls for removal of 3 commissioners State Rep. Toby Overdorf investigating whether 3 commissioners violated growth laws after calling for Mike Mortell's resignation City of Stuart, WPTV Stuart City Manager Mike Mortell faces a potential firing vote on Oct. 27 after Commissioner Sean Reed unexpectedly called for his resignation during a public meeting. By: Kate Hussey , Cassandra Garcia Posted and last updated STUART, Fla. — A controversy is erupting in Stuart ahead of Monday's critical vote that could cost City Manager Mike Mortell his job after more than two decades with the city.Last week, three commissioners called for Mortell's resignation without explanation. Ted Astolfi, a local resident, is now demanding the removal of those same commissioners, and a state lawmaker is investigating whether they broke state law.WATCH BELOW: Stuart resident calls for removal of 3 commissioners amid city manager controversy Stuart resident calls for removal of 3 commissioners amid city manager controversy \"Request the governor to remove these people from office,\" Astolfi said during a delegation meeting on Tuesday.He urged lawmakers to remove commissioners Sean Reed, Laura Giobbi and Christopher Collins.\"This is a bigger issue. This is about good government,\" Astolfi told WPTV. Astolfi is calling out the commissioners for \"dereliction of duty,\" claiming they first \"ambushed\" Mortell with a resignation request that wasn't on the agenda during a public meeting held Oct. 13. Now, he's also saying they may have violated state growth laws.All three commissioners are newly elected and have taken hard stands against development, reversing a Brightline deal. Then, in an Aug. 25 meeting, they voted to join a lawsuit against the state over Senate Bill 180, arguing the law oversteps local control of land use.At the same meeting, officials admitted the city already has ordinances that don't comply with the new law.\"We've enacted ordinances that are clearly in violation of our comprehensive plan; we're in direct violation of state law by failing to rescind,\" Mayor Campbell Rich said.\"I would like to see some sort of investigation to see if they have violated those laws,\" Astolfi said.State Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart, said his office is looking into the accusations and will be reviewing previous meeting minutes. \"We are looking at that and seeing if these accusations are in fact true,\" Overdorf said. \"We've also been contacted by others in the community who have said to us that these three commissioners are directing city staff to not follow state law. That's a concern.\" Giobbi denied those allegations, saying she has \"no idea what state law he's talking about\" and would not direct city staff to do anything improper. Stuart 'I truly am surprised': City manager at risk of losing job Aja Dorsainvil Collins says he's \"disappointed\" in the criticism but stands by voters who elected him to fight overdevelopment.\"I think Ted and his swamp creature friends, I think they're out of touch, and I think residents care more about traffic and overdevelopment rather than what Ted Astolfi thinks,\" Collins told WPTV.Reed declined to comment on camera amid a police investigation into threatening phone calls he says he's received. According to a police report that WPTV obtained, the calls were made by a \"politically connected individual and well-known businessman\" who was \"unhappy with a recent political statement made by Reed.\" Some taxpayers, like Robin Cartwright, however, do support a closer look at Mortell's performance.\"I'm not so much in favor of somebody being fired. I want to be very clear, I'm more in favor of his contract being reviewed. And if he's not abiding by his contract, then the commission holding him to that,\" Cartwright told WPTV last week. WPTV filed a public records request for complaints against Mortell from staff, officials or residents, but the City said they found none. His personnel file we requested shows no disciplinary action, no complaints and no negative feedback. Instead, he received two raises in recent years for strong performance.In last week's meeting, Giobbi cited only \"trust issues\" when asked about reasons for Mortell's potential dismissal.When pressed for specifics about the trust issues, Giobbi compared the situation to a private employment contract.\"If your employer decided that he wanted to end your contract with you, would you be happy if he posted all those reasons on the internet so everyone could see?\" Giobbi said.\"I think the difference though is that this deals with taxpayer dollars, my job doesn't,\" WPTV reporter Kate Hussey responded.\"It's still a contract,\" Giobbi said.Mortell has not returned calls for comment. The commission is set to vote Monday on whether to fire him as residents rally downtown in his support.WATCH BELOW: Rally scheduled to show support for embattled Stuart city manager Rally scheduled to show support for embattled Stuart city manager Several Stuart residents are voicing support for Mortell after Reed called for his resignation during a city commission meeting last week.Local real estate agent John Gonzalez said he was frustrated after watching the meeting.\"I was watching it online and was furious,\" Gonzalez said.Resident Robert Martin shared similar feelings, adding that he was surprised by the call for Mortell's resignation, given Mortell's experience with the city.\"I was a little upset because I couldn’t understand why someone with all of Mike's experience, everything Mike’s known and done through the years of being here that they would want to discount somebody's ability to make decisions,\" Martin said.Supporters point to Mortell's more than two decades of service with the city as a reason he's the perfect man for the job.\"All of these departments work and run very, very, well, and when you unceremoniously fire the leader, what's going to happen? I mean, I hope that we don’t have chaos between the ranks of the employees,\" Gonzalez said.In response, Gonzalez organized a rally in downtown Stuart on Wednesday, hoping to show city commissioners that residents want Mortell to remain in his position.\"There's a lot of people in the city of Stuart that love him and respect him and like the job that he's doing,\" Gonzalez said.Local business owner and longtime resident Jeff Bowers made it a point to attend the rally and show his support.\"He has been such a part of the fabric of this community and has done so much for the community,\" Bowers said.Some residents also expressed concern about the potential financial impact of replacing Mortell and conducting a search for a new city manager.\"As a taxpayer, I'm concerned about the cost of making an irrational decision,\" Gonzalez said.\"Whatever their intentions are, it’s the unintended consequences of what could come of this that really concerns me,\" Bowers added.The city commission agreed to revisit the discussion about Mortell's employment at its next meeting on Monday to allow them time to evaluate his performance.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and portions have been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

    "content": "NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin County Martin County Sheriff's Office investigating rooftop sneaker theft at Treasure Coast Mall Thieves got away with thousands of dollars in stolen merch, after dropping into Champs Sports MCSO By: Audra Schroeder , Ethan Stein Posted and last updated MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — The Martin County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) is investigating a rooftop burglary that took place at the Treasure Coast Mall on Tuesday morning, and the thieves reportedly made off with the stolen goods through a hole cut in the roof. MCSO provided photos of the discarded items on the roof of the mall, showing the damage to the concrete and some boxes of Nike and New Balance sneakers piled up. WATCH: Sheriff says thieves went for 'high-dollar shoes' Sheriff's office says thieves cut hole in mall rooftop to steal sneakers They say the thieves got away with thousands of dollars in merch, after dropping into a Champs Sports. The stolen merch was then bagged and thrown off the roof to a getaway vehicle. Sheriff John Budensiek told WPTV the crime \"appears to be right out of 'Mission Impossible,'\" and that the suspects spent a \"decent amount of time\" between Monday night and Tuesday morning cutting into the concrete and metal on the roof. He says the suspects stole between 400 to 500 pairs of shoes, though he says the number they actually got away with was roughly 300 to 400 pairs. MCSO \"They went after the high-dollar shoes,\" said Budensiek. A Champs employee called 911 on Tuesday to report the crime, and documents WPTV obtained show he noted he found the store's backroom a mess, then looked up and found the hole in the roof. The sheriff said that from the ground, mall security could not see anyone on the roof. The sheriff's office estimates it will cost $10,000 to repair the hole. MCSO asks anyone who has information about the incident to call them at 772-220-7060 or Treasure Coast Crime Stoppers at 1-800-273-TIPS.

Why are 18-wheelers on a one-lane road to deliver to Publix with almost no way to get out?\" Greenberg asked. Greenberg says both sides of Village Parkway and Innovation Way have streetlights that have been on and off for months, and says it's causing safety issues and backups.WPTV reporter Brooke Chau reached out to the city of Port St. Lucie about the streetlight concern on Innovation Way. The city said it was a circuit breaker that had been tripped and is now fixed and repaired.
