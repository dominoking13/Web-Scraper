    "headline": "How to avoid getting scammed on Cyber Monday",
    "content": "MoneyConsumer How to avoid getting scammed on Cyber Monday WPTV's Joel Lopez speaks to a cybersecurity expert on how shoppers can determine which deals are real and which aren't WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — Cyber Monday is underway as many holiday shoppers are turning to online deals to get those must-have gifts at great prices.But while you navigate through online promotions, you'll want to check twice as cybersecurity experts are calling this the Super Bowl of online scams.The challenge is navigating through all those Cyber Monday deals on social media and figuring out which are real and which aren't.At The Gardens Mall, holiday shopping is in full swing, where people tell WPTV they do a mix of in-person and online shopping.So what should you do to make sure you don't get scammed?For online shopper Mark Galvin, a fake online promotion cost him hundreds on golf shoes that he never got.\"I'm a golfer and last year a little pop-up came up on a Facebook ad, and it was for FootJoy, which is a popular brand and it was like 75-80% off and I never got the stuff,\" Galvin said.He said he disputed the charge but never got his money back.Galvin still does about 80% of his shopping online he said, because of the convenience and speed of delivery. He was at The Gardens Mall with his wife doing the rest of his holiday shopping.According to online data collection company DemandSage, consumers last year spent $13.3 billion during Cyber Monday. Cybersecurity expert Alan Crowetz said social media is the Wild West when it comes to Cyber Monday deals.\"People tend to think if it's online or a major media site then it must be true,\" Crowetz said. \"Always vet things, I hate to say it but as a cybersecurity expert, assume the worst. If it's too good to be true it probably is.\"Crowetz said there are a few red flags you can look out for.First is to be cautious any time you see a time limit on a deal or a limited supply on the item. He said the pressure causes consumers to let their guard down. Also make sure you're shopping through a credited online company or website.Crowetz said be careful when you're clicking on ads that redirect you to a different page, and watch out for influencers that are getting paid to promote a product.\"A lot of these influencers out there are very popular and they may have a million people following them but that doesn't mean they know what they're talking about,\" Crowetz said.He said you have to do your research to see if the \"discount\" price is actually a deal.Comparing the history of costs may reveal that the price of an item was increased before Cyber Monday, and \"discounted\" down to the same price it was previously priced for.Also, he warns to be careful for fake online reviews that were most likely paid for by companies.Shopper Donna Alexander said she loves shopping but says she's skeptical by all the online deals she sees on social media.\"I don't always trust them,\" Alexander said after she fell victim to an online scam earlier in the year. \"It was supposed to be lawn chairs, never came, never saw them.\"That's why the self-proclaimed bargain hunter went to The Gardens Mall for the rest of her holiday shopping.\"I like to see it, feel it, touch the product,\" Alexander said. \"I don't pay full price for much of anything.\"Another tip from Crowetz: If you're shopping online, use your credit card instead of your debit card. Crowetz said you'll have a better chance to dispute a potential scam and get your money back.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyDelray Beach Delray Beach school zone speed cameras begin 30-day warning period WPTV By: Emma Romano Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Automated speed cameras in Delray Beach school zones started issuing warnings today, marking the beginning of a 30-day grace period before citations are automatically issued to speeding drivers. Warning period details During the 30-day warning period, drivers caught speeding through school zones will receive warning notices instead of citations. After this grace period ends, the cameras will automatically issue citations to violators. How the system works The cameras operate during school hours, generally within 30 minutes before and after scheduled start and end times, and during the school session. A violation is recorded only when a vehicle exceeds the posted speed limit by more than 11 miles per hour.Each notice includes the date, time, location, speed and photographic evidence of the violation. Schools included in program The enforcement program covers multiple schools including Carver Middle, Pine Grove Elementary, Trinity Delray, Plumosa School of the Arts, Village Academy, Banyan Creek Elementary, Mount Olive Christian, St. Vincent Ferrer and Daughter of Zion Junior Academy. Each school sets its own exact enforcement times. Data security and oversight Captured data including photos, license plate information, date, time, location and speed are encrypted, digitally signed and stored in a secure vault to protect the chain of custody. A City of Delray Beach police traffic infraction enforcement officer is the only person authorized to decide if a Notice of Violation is justified. Future citation process Once the warning period ends, drivers who receive citations will have 30 days to either pay the civil fine or request a hearing. Citations can be paid online at secure.speedviolation.com or by phone at 888-710-9431.The program was authorized under House Bill 657 and is designed to improve safety for children and staff in school zones through deterrence and encouraging drivers to slow down in areas where students walk and cross streets.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

In the churches, everywhere. We feel the impact of the immigration fallout,” Emmanuel Similus said. He also added, “Whether you’re directly impacted, you have a friend, or you have a friend that has a friend, so we all feel it some kind of way.”Emmanuel Similus, who owns a restaurant in Delray Beach, said even his own niece is facing an immigration deadline. “She was allowed for two years and her two years was expired,” he said.Similus said his niece is among the 300,000 Haitians whose TPS will expire in less than 90 days.The Department of Homeland Security announced last week that TPS for Haitians will end Feb. 3, 2026, saying “Haiti no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem also urged Haitian TPS holders to prepare to “depart” if they have no other legal pathway to stay in the United States.Residents said the impact will be immediate. “Their jobs are on the line. The driving is on the line. Some of these people have cars, house, you know what,” one community member said.Haitian immigration attorney Frandley Julien said families are scrambling for answers and running out of time.“People are panicking, they don’t know what to do,\" Julien said. \"We have those mixed status families where you have a U.S. citizen spouse and the other spouse is on TPS — they don’t know what to do, what kind of decision they will have to come up with.” He warns that most TPS holders will have few, if any, options to remain in the country. \"For the vast majority of TPS holders, there will be no options,\" Julien said. \"We tell them they need to consult with an estate planning attorney, because you may have decisions to make.”Julien disputes the administration’s justification for ending TPS, saying conditions in Haiti have not improved. “Haiti is in worst shape today than it has ever been at any TPS designation moment,” he said. “Definitely the administration is mischaracterizing the condition on the ground.\"He said immigration advocates plan to challenge the decision in court. But for thousands of Haitian families, the uncertainty is overwhelming.",

She was a friend of everyone.\" And perhaps that's part of the reason even those who never knew her keep coming with flowers and prayers. There's a reason they line the streets in her honor. Sweeting-Mashkow's story is about courage. It's about service. It's about the idea that someone woke up one morning, put on a uniform, and chose to protect strangers — yet never came home. \"She made the ultimate sacrifice and it could have been any one of us,\" said Flowers. \"We've got a lot of people who are really hurting right now, and we're going to going to continue to try and help them and lean into each other and focus on what's the best thing for our agency and our community to get us through this tragedy.\" MORE WPTV COVERAGE: Region Indian River County 'She died a hero': Family members mourn deputy's death Ethan Stein Vero Beach Community honors fallen deputy at Vero Beach bridge Zitlali Solache Region Indian River County Pennsylvania artist creates painting for fallen deputy Zitlali Solache Region Indian River County Gunman dies after fatally shooting deputy, locksmith Craig Stephenitch Region Indian River County Mother called 911 about son weeks before Indian River County deputy shooting Jamie Ostroff This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

By: Jamie Ostroff Posted and last updated RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. — The director of a nonprofit in Riviera Beach is breathing a sigh of relief after nearly $11,000 was stolen from her organization's bank account, leaving her under stress and out of options.Margaret Brice came to a \"Let's Hear It\" community meetup in Boynton Beach to ask WPTV for help. Chief investigator Jamie Ostroff got right to work, searching for solutions.WATCH BELOW: Nonprofit gets nearly $11K in stolen funds returned after WPTV investigation Nonprofit gets nearly $11K in stolen funds returned after WPTV investigation Brice came to us after noticing three large, unrecognized transfers from her nonprofit's bank account into a different account with an out-of-state credit union. None of it made sense to her, especially when her bank told her it wasn't fraud.When Margaret Brice talks about her work at her Devotion Personal Development Group thrift boutique in Riviera Beach, she lights up. Twinkling sequins and vibrant colors adorn the racks, a reflection of the cheerful environment she and husband Roderick Lester work hard to create.\"Everyone who comes into the store really loves it,\" Brice said.Devotion's mission is to help people with disabilities and other barriers to employment find work.\"We assist them with resume building. We assist them with mock interviews. We go out into the community, we apply for jobs for them, we take them on the interview, and a lot of times they do get the position,\" Brice said.They even employ a few of those clients in the boutique, which opened in June.\"This is our little baby. We are very, very proud of it, and it's proving to be a place where people in the community can come and feel comfortable,\" Brice said.It's why the couple said they dug into their own pockets to cover a hit to the business that totaled $10,950.Brice brought Devotion's bank statements to a Let's Hear It event two weeks after noticing three withdrawals from the account that she didn't authorize: $3,800, $3,950 and $3,200. All of the transactions occurred on Oct. 7 from the same location: Tinker Federal Credit Union in Stillwater, Oklahoma.\"Never heard of Tinker Federal,\" Brice said.Brice said she immediately called her bank, Chase, to report it.\"We're going to escalate it. This should be simple. You're going to get your money back. Don't worry,\" she said that a bank representative told her. \"The following day, I called, and they said that the case was denied.”Brice then filed a police report and called Tinker Federal Credit Union, where the conversation was very different.\"Yes, ma'am, there is a flag on that account as fraud,\" she said a representative from the credit union told her. \"The money is there. All Chase needs to do is fill out a form, and they know what that form would be, have Chase contact them him, and he could release the money back to my account.\"Despite what Tinker Federal Credit Union told her, Chase continued to give her the same explanation: \"It was not fraud. The transaction was done from a known device, which was mine,\" she was told.WPTV reached out to our contacts at Chase Bank to see if we could get to the bottom of this.\"After further review,\" a company spokeswoman told WPTV in a statement a few weeks later, \"we were able to successfully return the funds to Ms. Brice.\"\"It was definitely a learning experience!\" Lester said.While Chase couldn't confirm exactly how the nonprofit's account was compromised, WPTV consulted multiple cybersecurity experts who pointed to a plethora of possibilities.Former CIA officer Erin Whitmore warns of the dangers of public WiFi.\"You log into your bank — credential — your bank account, and somebody is sitting on that internet— that open internet, unsecured connection, and they steal your username and password,\" said Whitmore, who now serves as managing director for CYPFER, a cybersecurity incident response firm.TrustNet's Trevor Horwitz explained the dangers of \"key logging\" software. \"Malware is installed onto a device and essentially records all of the keystrokes that you're performing,\" Horwitz said.And as identity verification expert Erick Soto of AuthID cautions, AI has made it easier than ever to fall for one of the oldest tricks in the book: phishing.\"Create a real-looking - you know, - website or email; no longer have typos, whereas before you used to spot them and you can spot typos. Now you have these types of tools that can proofread it. So it makes it look very credible,\" Soto said.To protect yourself, Chase and the experts we spoke with recommend steps like checking your devices for malware, keeping your operating system updated, using anti-malware software, and enabling two-factor authentication to log into personal accounts. Also, never respond to phone, text or online requests for access to your devices or account information. If you want to confirm whether any unsolicited contact is actually from your bank, call the number on the back of your card.As for Brice and Lester, they say they're now taking those extra steps to protect themselves and their nonprofit.\"Now we are utilizing every alert there is,\" Brice said.\"It's a relief,\" Lester said.\"Huge relief,\" Brice said. \"And I really credited a lot of it to WPTV.”Tinker Federal Credit Union did not respond to messages from WPTV.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
