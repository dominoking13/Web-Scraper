By: Ashley Glass Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — As the official media partners of the Palm Beach Zoo, WPTV always has the inside scoop on what's happening at the area's popular zoo. For this behind-the-scenes look, WPTV Morning Anchor Ashley Glass explored the benefits of native plants and trees with Lester Gulledge, the director of horticulture at the Palm Beach Zoo. Exploring the benefits of native plants at the Palm Beach Zoo Native plants and trees can be found throughout the zoo property, including in Tiger Forest. \"Almost 100% of the plants we planted here are native inside the habitat and out,\" Gulledge said.One of Gulledge's favorites, the beautyberry, is a very low-impact and low-input plant. \"They don’t need fertilizer, chemicals and they require less water,\" Gulledge said. \"They also benefit native species. That’s their food source. They’ve adapted with these, so they’re used to having them.”Gulledge added that native plants often outpace weeds and invasive species by way of growth, as another benefit of choosing native plants and trees when planting at home. ; }).then();",

They’ve also cited environmental issues with proposed development of softball fields on Sugar Sand Park and fears over changes to Memorial Park.“There is no reason that the City of Boca Raton needs a private partner to do any government facility. We do not need condos, we do not need apartments, we just need government facilities,” expressed Joe Majhess, a Boca Raton resident:At Tuesday’s meeting, developers announced a scaled-back version of the government campus project with Terra Frisbie Group from 31 acres to seven acres. Officials say details of the revised plan will be available at a future public meeting.Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer says Tuesday’s decision allows all residents to have their voices heard.“I think we allow that process to continue,” Singer said.“The extension is merely a vehicle to allow the public to continue to weigh in, to allow time to consider if we even have a deal and ultimately any deal voted on by the council will be ratified by the residents,” he continued.There is no word given on when council members plan to vote on the actual project. ; }).then();",

City of Port St. Lucie By: Cassandra Garcia Posted PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — A major transformation is coming to a currently undeveloped property along U.S. 1 in Port St. Lucie. The site has been chosen as the future home of a new United Soccer League (USL) team and city leaders say it's more than just a sports venue, but also a catalyst for economic growth.The city has agreed to contribute up to $27.5 million in tax increment revenue toward the construction of a new soccer stadium. These funds will not come from the city’s general budget, but from increases in property tax revenue, known as TIF (tax increment financing), generated over time and used to reinvest in the area.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: How will a new soccer stadium impact the Port St. Lucie economy \"This is absolutely insane for not only my business, I mean local surrounding businesses within a three to five mile radius,\" said Kevin Sapp, owner of Sapp’s Barbershop, located near the stadium site. His business, and others in the nearby plaza, are already anticipating the benefits of increased foot traffic and visibility.\"Looking out my window I’m going to see it,\" said barber Focus Sanders, referring to the 6,000-seat stadium set to rise across the street.Sapp believes the project will transform the area. “Just the thought of the amount of walk-in traffic that it’s going to bring to the area,” he said, expressing hope that the development will bring a steady stream of new customers.At Agape Boba Tea, employee Nicolle Chavez sees the project as an exciting opportunity.“A lot of people since there might be games there. They’re going to come here to this plaza and like buy food and stuff,” she said.City officials describe the project as part of a larger vision. The stadium is one component of the 46-acre Walton & One project, aimed at turning eastern Port St. Lucie into a walkable, mixed-use destination.“We will be able to see the stadium come to life and then we’re going to see the mix of uses come to life as well in terms of retail, commercial, office, hotels,” said Mayor Shannon Martin.Local leaders and businesses hope the investment will have long-term economic impact. The Economic Development Council estimates the project could generate nearly 500 new jobs.“You have to put money in to get money back,” said Sanders. “They’re putting money into this area as an investment with the hopes that it’s going to bring it back and I think something like this is going to bring it back to the city.”Chavez agreed. She said, “this is like a big impact for the community, so I think the money is going to get used right.”The stadium is expected to be built by the time the men’s team, called the Port St. Lucie Sports Club, begins playing in 2027.“Bringing something that huge here is going to bring – it’s going to bring people, it's going to bring revenue, it’s going to bring more businesses,” Sanders added. “This is pretty cool.”Portions of this story were assisted by artificial intelligence tools and reviewed by a WPTV journalists to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to editorial standards. ; }).then();",

Voices from the water At the meeting, boater Matthew Woods, who lives in Lake Worth, expressed his concerns.\"This affects a lot of people,\" he said.A group of boaters who moor in the Lake Worth Lagoon gathered for a first reading, hoping to shift the tide on the push by the town council to remove illegal mooring buoys and other boats anchored without a permit.\"We've always been on the water we've always used the water,\" Martha Gayle, a boater from Lake Clarke Shores, emphasized.\"We're good people, we have the right to use the water for recreation,\" Woods added.The proposed ordinance also targets derelict vessels that have been abandoned on the waterway and have posed a hazard when they break loose. Palm Beach Boat owners frustrated over plan to remove illegal mooring buoys from lagoon Kendall Hyde \"It's always the one bad apple, they're punishing the good citizens, average people like myself who have the right to use our state waters,\" Woods said, criticizing this approach, saying town council has their efforts misdirected.He said he's also in favor of removing derelict boats as they also pose harm his boats.Woods has two boats moored in the lagoon and voiced his frustrations about the lack of options.\"There's nowhere to go, I've checked within a 50-mile radius, there's nowhere that I can take my boat. Nowhere. The marinas are all full, there's no mooring fields,\" he said.He continued, expressing that relocating to distant locations such as Miami or Jacksonville is not a feasible solution, stating, \"that's not going to work, it's not fair.\" A community concern Woods, who is a member of the Palm Beach Sailing Club, explained the ripple effect these regulations could have on the community.\"At the sailing club, we teach little kids how to sail, little 7-year-olds,\" he said. \"But when that kid becomes 17, 19 and wants to buy a 30-foot boat, where's he going to put it? It's not going to happen.\"The town argues that the changes will prevent damage to the seabed, but Woods contests, stating that moors are a safer alternative as they screw into the waterway floor instead of an anchor and chain that can possibly damage marine life when it drags along the ground.Martha Gayle, who relies on mooring as an affordable option, shared her own struggles. \"I can't afford a dock. I'm a retired schoolteacher and I don't have the income to afford that luxury,\" she said.She expressed her fears that the town's initiative would force her to sell a boat that she has kept moored in the lagoon for 15 years.WATCH PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Town announced plan last week to clean up Lake Worth Lagoon Boat owners push back over plan to remove illegal mooring buoys from Lake Worth Lagoon \"What do you hope is the outcome from today?\" Lopez asked Gayle during the gathering.\"I'd like for someone to make a plan so we can stay,\" she replied. \"I'm heartbroken. To throw us all out at the same time doesn't seem fair. It's been like this for decades, all of a sudden I don't understand why all the change.\"Concerns from the community were taken to Mayor Danielle Moore, who declined an on-camera interview.She told Lopez she isn't familiar with costs or availability of marinas and docks, but that state legislature does allow them to make regulations to clean the waterways.\"I'm just praying that things work out and that we're treated fairly,\" said Woods.The meeting was ongoing at the time this story made broadcast. ; }).then();",

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach County Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick sues opponent to stop negative attack ads She's asking the court for damages worth more than $1 million and an order from the judge to stop her primary opponent from attacking her publicly WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is suing her primary opponent, Elijah Manley, in Broward County court over libel and cyberstalking allegations.She's asking the court for damages worth more than $1 million and an order from the judge to stop her primary opponent from attacking her publicly. WATCH: Elijah Manley says lawsuit sends 'chilling message' about free speech Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick sues opponent to stop negative attack ads The congresswoman’s lawsuit claims Manley’s statements and advertisements about her company wrongly accepting millions in COVID-19 pandemic funds are “damaging her reputation and inflicting great emotional harm.\" The dispute centers around a health care company, Trinity Health Care Services, that Cherfilus-McCormick owned before she became a congresswoman. The company, according to state records, received a contract during the COVID-19 pandemic to perform vaccination registration at churches along with other locations, and even going door-to-door.The Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) later sued the company after it claimed the state agency committed a clerical error resulting in overpayments worth $5.7 million then the company refused to payback the state. WPTV’s Ethan Stein obtained documents in July showing the company settled the lawsuit to pay back the state on an installment plan over the next 19 years.According to FDEM records, the company will have to pay around $350,000 each year to the department over the time period, with the first two payments worth $50,000. According to the settlement, neither party will admit wrongdoing or liability and each party will pay their own attorneys.The congresswoman has declined all interview requests about the dispute with the state multiple times since WPTV published its first story about the dispute back in January. WPTV Investigates How state’s attempt to claw back $5M involves Florida congresswoman Ethan Stein Our news team has been pushing for answers, because a “Findings of Fact and Citation to Law” report from the House of Representatives said Cherfilus-McCormick’s salary increased by $6 million from 2020 to 2021. The report was created because Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick (D) is under federal ethics investigation over allegations she exceeded the legal limit by spending more than $2,500 of her own money on her campaign.The report said the congresswoman might have broken House rules and federal law because it alleges a company she owned payed more than $250,000 to a state political action committee called Leadership in Action. Then the group, who was governed by her campaign manager, Mark Goodrich, paid himself for various campaign materials. The report also alleged Goodrich participated in creating official materials while being paid by campaign funds. Elijah Manley, who is running against Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, said he was surprised when he found out the congresswoman sued him. He said he was just connecting the dots and amplifying publicly available information reported by various media outlets, including WPTV.“This is just a very logical look at the situation,” said Manley. “And I can easily say, ‘Well, I mean she got the overpayment for this amount and it somehow ended up in an account and it somehow ended up in her campaign.’ There’s no other source that we can see that could be legitimate and her health care business before that wasn’t making millions of dollars. To me it seems very easy to look at on its face and determine.”He also said he believes the congresswoman is filing a lawsuit against the advertisement to drain his campaign resources while suppressing people’s ability to campaign with negative attack ads about the Trinity Health Care dispute. Elijah Manley for Congress Still from Elijah Manley's campaign ad. The lawsuit accuses Manley of creating a false, malicious ad that is intended to harm plaintiff’s reputation. Michael Pizzi, attorney for the congresswoman, said Manley’s advertisements along with a letter to the editor sent to the Sun-Sentinel were slanderous and created great emotional harm for his client. “The false statements published by Defendant [Manley] exposed Plaintiff [Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick] to distrust, disgrace, hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy by the public,” reads the lawsuit. “They were also targeted to and did cause destruction to her as a citizen and public official.” The attorney also asked the judge for an order asking Manley to stop him from attacking her and destroying her good reputation. FULL LAWSUIT: Manley, who said he’s hired a legal firm to represent himself in court, said he’s frustrated he’ll have to spend campaign resources on the lawsuit rather than the election. But he said he’s also concerned about the congresswoman’s attempts to stop candidates from talking about issues on the campaign trail. “It’s obviously going to cost me a lot of money to defeat this lawsuit,” Manley said. “But I think this sends a chilling message to anyone that their free speech, their voice can be silenced because they don’t like what they’re saying.” Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick has declined WPTV’s requests to answer questions about the situation with the overpayment and her health company multiple times. Her office also declined to make her available to talk about the lawsuit. Her family, according to past WPTV reporting, now controls Trinity Health Care Services.Manley said he believes the voters have the right to know about the issues related to their congressional representative. He said it sends a “bad message” that the congresswoman has stopped answering questions about the overpayment issues. “An elected official, somebody who is tasked with representing our community, can just ignore the press, can just run away from journalists,” Manley said. “It sends a message that she lacks the transparency and the temperament needed to be a member of Congress.” ; }).then();",

The city's proposal — $10,000 a month to use another facility — is simply not possible, according to board member Tom McArdle.\"There literally has not been an inch of progress since,\" McArdle told WPTV.He said the nonprofit has reached a breaking point.\"For The Children is constantly having to tell families, no, we can't take your child, because we're at capacity,\" he said.Since WPTV first reported on this issue, McArdle said communication with the city has led nowhere — and he fears it's the children who will be impacted the most. Lake Worth Beach 'It just gets crowded': Nonprofit asks city for help as space issues grow Vannia Joseph \"The reality is, programs like this aren't just a place for kids to go after school,\" McArdle said. \"There are two girls that were in this program before who couldn't come back this year, because of the lack of space — and they've gone missing. That's what we're dealing with when you talk about at-risk kids. We're talking about the underserved kids, and not just the kids on the south side, all across Lake Worth. We're trying to serve more of this community and the city says they want to help do that but there actions say otherwise.\"Seeking answers, WPTV reached out to the city's Leisure Services Department.

    "content": "NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates Are our lawmakers pocketing paychecks while federal workers go unpaid during shutdown? WPTV investigation reveals mixed responses from Florida representatives as shutdown enters third week AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana A sign that reads \"Closed due to federal government shutdown,\" is seen outside of the National Gallery of Art on the 6th day of the government shutdown, in Washington, Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. By: Dave Bohman Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going without pay as the government shutdown stretches into its third week, but what about the lawmakers who represent you? A WPTV investigation found that while some Florida representatives are forgoing their salaries, others won't say whether they're still collecting paychecks. WATCH: The lawmakers who tell WPTV they're not accepting pay during shutdown Here are the Florida lawmakers who say they're not accepting pay during shutdown I reached out to all seven lawmakers representing Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast with a simple question: Are you taking pay during the shutdown? Four responded, and their answers may surprise you. All four lawmakers who responded say they shouldn't pocket their salary during this government shutdown. It's a move that resonates with constituents who question why air traffic controllers, park rangers and hundreds of thousands of other federal workers must go without pay while elected officials can continue drawing their salaries.\"Is it OK for them to draw a paycheck when the government is shut down?\" WPTV's Dave Bohman asked. No. I don't agree with that,\" Laura Bando said. Sridhar Krishnan echoed that sentiment: \"If government is shutting down, why would we pay senators and congressmen?\" Jamie Dreyfuss-Landerman added: \"Aren't they usually millionaires to start with? OK, yeah, they don't need a paycheck.\" State Federal shutdown puts 95,000 Florida workers at risk as leaders clash over blame Forrest Saunders Four lawmakers commit to forgoing payU.S. Senator Rick Scott says he's not taking a paycheck and posted on X that he'll push his No Budget, No Pay Act, which holds members of Congress accountable for passing a budget or forgoing their pay.Senator Ashley Moody sent out a news release, stating: \"I will be donating my salary to the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay which provides help to vulnerable populations.\" Congressman Mike Haridopolous, whose district includes Indian River County, wrote by text: \"Until the government reopens, I will not be accepting pay.\" Congressman Jared Moskowitz, whose district represents southern Palm Beach County, posted on X: \"As long as the government is in shutdown, I will not take a paycheck.\" National Politics Shutdown drags on as Senate fails again to pass funding bill Scripps News Group Three lawmakers remain silentThe investigation found three lawmakers who wouldn't answer questions about their pay status. The offices of Representatives Brian Mast, Lois Frankel and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick did not respond to emails asking the yes-or-no question: \"Are you taking pay during the shutdown?\" FAU Political Science Professor Craig Burnett said the public won't really pay attention until things get much worse.\"Here we are, it's October 2025, right? The next chance you really have to see what voters think of their elected officials on how this situation was handled is over a year away,\" Burnett said.Constitutional complicationsThe U.S. Constitution is widely interpreted to mean lawmakers cannot legally refuse pay. They can, like Senator Moody, divert their paychecks to charity, or have their pay withheld during the shutdown and either collect or donate that money when the shutdown ends.The investigation will continue pressing these lawmakers to reveal what they'll do with their current pay or back pay when the shutdown concludes.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

Those charges are not defined as sex offenses.As part of a plea deal, the state dropped three other felonies, including possession of child pornography.\"This case should be a warning cry to parents that you need to monitor what your kids are doing, and we really are failing this generation,\" said defense attorney Andrew Metcalf.Under the agreement, Cromer will not have to register as a sex offender, but will be a convicted felon unable to pursue a career in law enforcement.One of the two alleged victims was in court Tuesday but did not testify.Her attorney strongly objected to the plea agreement, saying her client has been significantly impacted by what happened.Since Cromer's arrest, Indian River County Sheriff Eric Flowers has raised his hiring age for deputies to 21. ; }).then();",
