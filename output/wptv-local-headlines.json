By: Zitlali Solache Posted and last updated INDIAN RIVER COUNTY, Fla. — Indian River County Sheriff Eric Flowers is speaking out after county leaders slashed millions of dollars from his budget request.In a four-minute video on social media, Flowers claims county leaders are taking a ‘defund the police’ approach.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Indian River County Sheriff blames county leaders following budget debate “Today we start out, over $5 million short of the money we need to keep our community safe,” said Flowers.He blames county administrator John Titkanich for cutting his request. Flowers said the letter from Titkanich shows cuts made to ammunition, mental health for first responders, and more.“Folks, an unelected bureaucrat has told me, the elected sheriff of Indian River County, that mental health for first responders is not important, that dog food for our canines is not important.”The document shows cuts to uniforms, inmate meals, other investigative supplies, and more.“I never thought that in 2025, in the United States of America, in the state of Florida and especially in Indian River County, that we would ever see the defund the police movement come to our hometown,” said Flowers.Months ago, Flowers originally requested $14.6 million and then reduced his request to $12.2 million for the sheriff's office following debate with county commissioners. However, county leaders cut $5 million from the request, approving a roughly $86 million budget for the 2025/2026 fiscal year.“What they don’t realize is that there are items inside this budget that are directly related to protecting our schools, to protecting our children, and protecting our community ever since day,’ said Flowers. “We will not stop here. We are going to do everything legally possible to ensure that the operations to the Indian River County sheriff are properly funded.”WPTV’s Zitlali Solache reached out to the county for a statement:“Since taking office in 2020, the sheriff has seen his budget grow from $57.82 million to $85.77 million—an increase of nearly $28 million or 48%. The Sheriff’s Office now accounts for 53.6% of the County’s General Fund and is receiving 72% of all new General Fund revenue this fiscal year.” County leaders also added, “The board remains committed to fiscal responsibility and transparency while ensuring that public safety remains a top priority.” ; }).then();",

The combined data could indicate significant challenges ahead for American workers.WATCH BELOW: Searching for a job? Here's how to get your resume noticed Searching for a job? Here's how to get your resume noticed Finding employment in today's market increasingly means navigating computer algorithms that screen applications before human eyes ever see them.\"You're not a person anymore, just a person online,\" job seeker Amber Cusano of Port St. Lucie said.The frustration is mounting for many applicants who feel their qualifications aren't being properly evaluated.\"Clearly, in my instance and maybe more people, it's not about work history. Something else is going on, something is looking at these and kicking them out,\" Cusano said.What's happening involves Applicant Tracking System (ATS) — computers that scan resumes for specific keywords before passing them to hiring managers.\"Don't throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, really have a tailored resume and tailored job search, know what you want,\" said Sam DeMase from job website ZipRecruiter.DeMase said there are strategies to improve success rates with these automated systems.\"The best way to get past that is to get niche down and tailor your resume with a lot of specific keywords that are relevant to the job description, so we're noticing companies are using this AI or ATS to filter resumes, candidates should be using it as well,\" DeMase said.Amy Korn in Palm Beach County discovered a method that worked for her job search.\"For every job listing, I asked ChatGPT to give me hints on how I could revise, tweak those ATS, certain key words, and just by changing your resume to some keywords, you have a better probability of getting contacted,\" Korn said.While her approach succeeded in landing interviews, experts warn about potential pitfalls.\"If you notice a mismatch of keywords, you're probably applying for the wrong job,\" DeMase said.The sluggish job market is particularly challenging for new college graduates. A recent Federal Reserve report indicates that recent graduates are bearing the brunt of current market shifts.Will Luther, an economics associate professor at Florida Atlantic University, acknowledged the concerns among students.\"Absolutely, there are students very much concerned with whether or not they will be able to get a job when they finish here. The good news is that they will. The bad news is it's a little harder right now than it was, say, two years ago,\" Luther said.Luther emphasized the importance of adapting to changing market demands.\"You have to understand the labor market is changing a lot of my colleagues are developing AI courses, AI programs and if you don't have those skills you're not going to do well on the labor market and beyond that you have to find ways of separating yourself from everyone else out there who's trying for the same job you want, whether that's a project in addition to your coursework and internship you have to find way to be different from everyone else,\" Luther said.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

I just feel the streets belong to DOT,\" said Taynor. \"Honestly, I just believe that all the roads should be empty of anything other than the Department of Transportation signs and notifications.\"Taynor expressed that she would prefer to see the next art project on a building, sign, or window of a business that supports the LGBTQ+ community, sharing a wider perspective on where representation could take place.\"What would be your message to the city at this point?\" asked Lopez to Lerner.\"Definitely keep fighting; we need to not give in to our governor, and we need to fight for what we want as a city,\" said Lerner.Suggestions from the public input meeting will be taken to city commissioners at a later date.Read more of WPTV's related coverage below: LGBTQ+ 'We’re fighting back as a city': FDOT sandblasts Delray Beach Pride mural Joel Lopez LGBTQ+ 'Heartbreaking': City removes rainbow crosswalk to comply with FDOT regulations Joel Lopez LGBTQ+ Delray Beach explores Pride intersection replacements Ange Toussaint ; }).then();",

The sheriff's office said the person had already been deported twice, which constitutes an automatic felony under Florida law.WATCH BELOW: Arrest outside grocery store highlights Florida's growing ICE enforcement Arrest outside Okeechobee grocery store highlights Florida's growing ICE enforcement The agency posted on social media Monday to respond to the video, which has been making rounds on the internet, saying in part, \"We want to emphasize that neither the Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office nor ICE are conducting 'raids' at local businesses. This was a lawful traffic stop, handled in a professional and safe manner by our deputies.\"This is one of many arrests happening as ICE increases joint operations across Florida and the U.S. Officials say Florida is leading the nation in these enforcement partnerships.ICE said in a Tuesday news release that it detained more than 400 undocumented migrants across Florida in a five-day operation spanning Sept. 22-26.On social media, federal officials touted the results, writing that \"Florida is leading the nation\" in joint enforcement efforts.The Department of Homeland Security said in a Sept. 23 news release that more than 2 million people have been \"removed or ... self-deported\" nationwide since President Donald Trump returned to office. Officials said they expect another 200,000 removals by the end of this year.The recent joint operation in Okeechobee has sparked different opinions among people who live nearby. State Florida officials announce more than 6,000 immigration arrests Kate Payne \"They're just scared, period,\" said Jessica Gaskim, who witnessed the arrest outside the grocery store. \"I'm minding my own business, and that's when I saw all the undercovers and ICE.\"Gaskim said she understands the effort to remove dangerous criminals but worries about broad enforcement.\"They don't want the drugs, they don't want the rapists, but not all of them are like that. To me, that just is discrimination,\" Gaskim said.Other residents like Alison Dotson are more supportive of the operations.\"I look at it as fairness, honestly,\" Dotson told WPTV reporter Michael Hoffman. \"If I did something illegal, I would get the same punishment. When you do wrong, you get what you deserve. I mean, I work with all kinds of races, and they all think it's fairness. ... It's nothing racial. ...

The average score in reading was the lowest in the history of the nearly 34-year assessment. Only 32% of high school seniors scored below \"basic,\" meaning they are struggling in reading comprehension.WPTV's Christy Waite connected with Nicole Zwibel, a local reading specialist who said the trend is concerning. She also believes that state testing is becoming more difficult.Some educational leaders believe the downward trend goes beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and chronic absenteeism. Zwibel said she is seeing more students come in with processing and learning disabilities like dyslexia, ADHD, autism, anxiety and depression.Waite reached out to our local school districts to find out how students are performing here at home.St. Lucie Public Schools tells us there's been improvement in reading. Freshmen improved by three points, and 10th graders improved by four points, matching or outpacing statewide gains.The district is also seeing gains in math, with algebra and geometry scores on the rise.

Deputies repeatedly asked the man what was going on and why he was blocking traffic.At one point during the interaction, the man appears to take a swing at one of the deputies — but misses. Despite the apparent aggression, deputies remained calm and never escalated the situation.“We’re not charging him with anything,” one deputy is heard telling a bystander. “He’s obviously going through a crisis.”The man was safely taken into custody and transported to a nearby hospital under Florida’s Baker Act, which allows for temporary, involuntary mental health evaluation and treatment. He will not face any charges.CIT Training Credited for Peaceful OutcomeDeputies on scene credited their Crisis Intervention Team training for helping them safely manage the situation.“You guys called it in and asked for somebody that has CIT training. But I think pretty much every deputy goes through that training,” the deputy explained to the family.“You could tell by looking at him and talking to him that he’s not making these decisions.”A Viral Video with Missing ContextWhile the viral video clip captured only a split-second moment — what looked like a violent attack — the bodycam footage shows that deputies acted with patience and professionalism throughout the incident. What could have turned into a dangerous encounter was resolved without injury or arrest.Authorities are using the incident to highlight the importance of CIT training and encourage families to call for help when a loved one is in crisis. ; }).then();",
