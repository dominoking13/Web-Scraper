LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. — A Treasure Coast family is working to ensure no one else experiences the heartbreak they’ve endured.WATCH BELOW: 'We don’t want any other family to go through that,' Melanie Trewyn tells WPTV's Brooke Chau Treasure Coast family fights for change after woman's death At our recent Let’s Hear It community event in Jensen Beach, WPTV reporter Brooke Chau connected with Melanie Trewyn, a mother whose world changed forever on Super Bowl Sunday in 2021.“She had gotten in the car to get a pizza for her family and never made it,\" said Trewyn. Her daughter, Claudia, was killed by a drunk driver on Indian River Drive on February 7, 2021. WPTV Claudia was a new mother at the time.“She and her husband had just had a baby; fortunately the baby was not in the car,” Trewyn said.Out of respect for Claudia’s young daughter, the family chooses not to share photos publicly. However, the family said you don’t need to see a picture to understand the weight of their loss.Claudia, adopted as a teenager from Guatemala, quickly became “the heart of the family.” She pushed through language barriers and a learning disability to achieve her dream of becoming the first in her biological family to graduate from college.“It had been her goal to be the first and she did that in spite of not knowing English and in spite of having a learning disability,” said Trewyn. In the aftermath of the crash, the Trewyn family founded Remember for Change, a nonprofit dedicated to preventing impaired and distracted driving. WPTV Every year on February, they host the Remember for Change Memorial Drive, honoring those lost and urging drivers across the Treasure Coast to think twice before getting behind the wheel impaired.“We don’t want any other family to go through that and that’s why my husband and I are doing this,” Trewyn said. As the five-year anniversary of Claudia’s death approaches, her family hopes sharing her story will spark conversations — and save lives. Claudia’s family and the Remember for Change team are continuing their outreach across the Treasure Coast. For more information on their mission and upcoming events, click here.",

Former Eviction Task Force member describes dangers of serving notices after deputy killed “When the helicopter showed up, plus when the SWAT vehicle, that’s when I knew it was bad,” said neighbor Wes Gordon, who witnessed the response unfold.Gordon said he was stunned to learn the situation began with deputies attempting to serve an eviction notice.“That must have been the last thing that person could handle. And they just snapped,” he said.Law enforcement expert Tim Miller, who previously served on an eviction team, told WPTV that the most routine aspects of police work, like serving eviction notices or conducting traffic stops, can often be the most dangerous.“Things can change in a second,” Miller said. “You always go into an eviction with eyes wide open. These were seasoned officers... But it’s also very apparent that in today's world, gunfire erupts in quarter seconds or half seconds, and that's what occurred here.”Miller called the incident “a tragedy beyond belief.” He emphasized that deputies like Mashkow step into harm’s way daily, fully aware of the risks.“This reminds us of the high-cost law enforcement pays just to do their job,” he said. “When you lose a 25-year veteran that everybody respected, it has a huge impact on the department. Our support and prayers need to be with the families and the department during this difficult time.”Miller added that moments like this highlight the importance of appreciating first responders who routinely put their lives on the line.He said a simple thank you “means more than you realize.”WPTV will continue to follow updates from investigators as more information becomes available.MORE WPTV COVERAGE: Region Indian River County 'She died a hero': Family members mourn deputy's death Ethan Stein Region Indian River County 'Absolute tragedy': Neighbors near Bermuda Club community shocked by shooting Tyler Hatfield",

The decision comes months after the County Commission initially voted in March to move forward with buying the 114-room hotel for $16.8 million.County officials now say the deal is dead after inspections revealed significant structural and safety concerns inside the building. According to the county, the hotel had waterlogged floors and ceilings, mold growth, and multiple other hazards, making renovations far more costly than originally anticipated.Because of those findings, commissioners voted this month to terminate the contract. Officials emphasized that no taxpayer dollars were spent before the decision to withdraw.Commissioner Maria Sachs, who opposed the project from the beginning, said the hotel was never a suitable solution for vulnerable residents.“The most important thing is that when we realized as a county government that this was not going to work, we withdrew from the contract… we were not going to put our people in a place that was not suitable for them,” Sachs said.She previously argued that dignity “doesn’t come from a motel room,” and maintains that the county must pursue better long-term options.With the hotel plan abandoned, county leaders say they are turning their attention to alternative approaches to address homelessness. Sachs noted that tiny homes are among the ideas currently being explored, with more discussions expected in the coming weeks.",
