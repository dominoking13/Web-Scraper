But now, those same beloved trees have become the center of a heated debate over safety and maintenance costs.The homeowners association board is considering removing some of the oak trees due to problems caused by their roots, which are buckling sidewalks and infiltrating sewer lines. The situation has divided both the board and the community.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Village Walk residents debate future of nearly 1,000 oak trees amid safety concerns \"You can see now that they're making this tunnel of trees,\" said Steve Brandes, an HOA board member who chose to live in Village Walk partly because of the trees.However, Brandes and other residents are concerned about what they see as a push to remove many of the oaks.\"We've got concerted effort to basically remove many of our oak trees,\" Brandes said.The board president emphasized that no final decisions have been made and no contracts have been signed. The board brought in Coulter and Harring, the original tree installers, to present options and gather community input.\"We're all here to get educated,\" Board president Bruce Ciarlariello said at the start of Monday night’s meeting.The proposed solutions range from removing or replacing the oaks with easier-to-manage trees to simply increasing maintenance efforts. Despite assurances that options were being explored, many residents arrived at the meeting worried that clear-cutting had already been decided.\"This is a lot of hogwash,\" one resident said during the meeting.However, others left feeling more optimistic about the process.\"I am absolutely delighted. I don't know how you convince this board to actually let you talk about alternatives and to actually present that there are other methods other than just completely eliminating all these trees. That's exactly what we've been asking for,\" another resident said.Regardless of their position on the trees, residents agreed on one key point: community input should drive the decision.\"I think everybody here should have a voice on that and a vote,\" one resident said.decisions are expected to be made soon, but an exact date is, at this time, unclear.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

The goal, they say, is to choose projects that best serve the community’s needs.“Whatever facilities we do, they serve the needs of our constituents and our neighborhood,” district officials said during Monday’s meeting.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Boca Raton considers surf park among four proposals for North Park recreation site Among the proposals under review are plans for the Kemper Golf Course, a new recreation center, and new sports and community facilities. But the project gaining the most attention and the highest ranking so far is the proposed Boca Surf Park.The surf park would bring man-made waves to Boca Raton using Wavegarden Cove technology, a closed-circuit surf lagoon capable of holding between 25,000 and 50,000 cubic meters of water. The project also includes a 40,000-square-foot indoor facility on a 23.8-acre site.At Red Reef Park, one of the area’s most popular beach spots, surfers and beachgoers said they welcome the idea.“I think it’s a great opportunity for more people to come together in the community,” one resident said.Boca Raton resident Damien Lovin said the concept could fill a local gap for quality surf experiences.“It’s actually a pretty cool concept because there’s not really much opportunity to come to the East Coast, especially South Florida, and catch some good waves,” Lovin said.Still, district officials emphasize that no final decision has been made. City officials tell us they’re still waiting on key financial details from each proposal before moving forward. They also say there’s no set timeline for when a decision will be made. );",

By: Kayla McDermott Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A suspicious hunting stand discovered just 200 yards from where President Trump's plane lands at Palm Beach International Airport has prompted a major FBI investigation and raised new questions about presidential security.The elevated perch in a tree line was found by the Secret Service before Trump arrived on Friday, leading to a complete 24-hour shutdown of Southern Boulevard as federal agents investigated the potential threat.WATCH: Security experts noted change in Trump's departure from PBIA Hunting stand discovered near PBIA raises questions about security FBI Director Kash Patel described the structure as a \"suspicious hunting stand\" positioned with a clear view of the airport where Air Force One landed when Trump visited his Mar-a-Lago resort.\"While an inconvenience to the general public, it was the right call,\" said Stuart Kaplan, a former FBI agent.Kaplan provided insight into the extensive investigation now underway behind the scenes. \"They have assets, resources and methodology that is generally not known to the public. The FBI is deploying those assets,\" Kaplan said. \"There is an effort to do a forensic examination. There may be DNA, there may be digital evidence.\" Three sources familiar with the matter tell NBC News that investigators believe the stand was most likely set up months ago. \"If that's the case, it's going to narrow the time frame,\" said Tim Miller, a former Secret Service agent. WPTV Investigates Forensic investigation could determine when hunting stand installed Dave Bohman Miller explained that his former agency works around the clock to protect the president, but the job has become increasingly challenging due to evolving threats. \"We have threats that we've never seen before directed against the president,\" Miller said.The discovery comes after two assassination attempts against Trump, including one that occurred in West Palm Beach. Security experts noted changes in Trump's departure procedures Sunday night, when he used a smaller staircase to board Air Force One. \"You saw him use a staircase that basically is the entrance into the lower body, trying to shield and provide him with added cover,\" Kaplan said.Kaplan suggested that agents may need to restrict Trump's traditionally open interactions with the public. \"The impromptu stops in the motorcade will not happen, I think rightfully so,\" Kaplan said.The investigation continues as federal authorities work to identify who constructed the hunting stand and determine whether it posed a legitimate threat to presidential security.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

WATCH BELOW: Senior jobs program returning amid funding uncertainty Funding restored for senior jobs program The program helps seniors fill financial gaps between retirement benefits and daily living expenses like rent, groceries and medical bills.Patrick Franklin, president and CEO of the Urban League of Palm Beach County, said the organization was informed at the end of September that funding would be released, but the federal government shutdown has injected uncertainty into the process of re-launching. The Urban League administers the program for Broward and Miami-Dade counties.\"The chaotic roller coaster that we're on— we're off today, on tomorrow. Who knows what next week is going to be?\" Franklin said.When WPTV first reported on the program's closure in August, Franklin said the funding was cut at the end of June, and that the national Urban League funded the program for the final two months.The program shutdown forced the Urban League of Palm Beach County to close its Broward County office permanently, lay off staff and donate furniture and equipment to other nonprofits.Maralyn Lewis was among those laid off at the Broward County office.\"I was bombarded with calls. The participants were all disappointed,\" Lewis told WPTV in August.Lewis is a retiree from New York whose job was funded by the senior jobs program.\"Being older, there's so much competition and a lot of people seeking employment,\" Lewis said.\"There are no funds. So we're still in a limbo, but we've been ordered to be ready to go Nov. 1,\" Franklin said. He noted that the program will resume the first weekend of November, regardless of federal funding. \"It's just a necessary component for our seniors. Two hundred twenty-five seniors will have a part-time job that fills the gaps that they have between their retirement, their benefits and their daily needs to live, to pay their rent, to buy their groceries, to pay their medical bills,\" Franklin said.Franklin said the Urban League of Palm Beach County plans to front the money to relaunch the program from Miami.\"We are on a roller coaster that doesn't seem to stop,\" Franklin said. \"And at the end of the day, my goal is to make sure that we're open to serve those in need every day.\"Seniors in Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast can access the program through AARP.\"This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
