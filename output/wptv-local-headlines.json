The streets are big enough and long enough for them to use.” This new rule follows Senate Bill 462, which gives cities and towns more power to regulate these devices.The new rule bans bikes on commercial sidewalks, with violators facing penalties.Some have mixed feeling about the change, and other worry this could make things less safe, since not every street has a bike lane.

WATCH: Sheriff's office reviewing every case where Adamo is a suspect Babysitter accused of poisoning child had similar case in 2014 Hoffman uncovered documents showing this isn't the first time she's been accused of harming a child in her care. We found a complaint against Adamo from 2014. A doctor suspected a child was poisoned, but investigators determined there was not enough evidence to file any charges. Now, more than 11 years later, they're taking a closer look given these new allegations. Investigators in Okeechobee are asking parents to come forward if they've left their child in the care of Adamo.On Tuesday, Adamo faced multiple charges, including attempted first-degree murder, after investigators say she poisoned an 11-month-old she was babysitting with antifreeze.Investigators say they're taking a deeper look into her past.This 2014 investigation into Adamo, obtained through a records request, shows another child in her care was rushed to the hospital after a possible poisoning. Although that case was dropped due to lack of evidence, digging deeper reveals the allegations are nearly identical to each other.In both cases, parents dropped off their kids at Adamo's home in good health. When the parents picked up their kids, they were lethargic and not acting right. Tests at the hospital would prove both children had been suffering from ethylene glycol (antifreeze) poisoning.WATCH: Anna Adamo leaves jail on bond Okeechobee woman accused of poisoning infant with antifreeze charged with attempted murder \"How can lightning strike twice?\" said attorney and former Palm Beach County state attorney Dave Aronberg.I sat down with Aronberg, who tells me that the 2014 case, even if charges were never filed, can still play a role in the prosecution 11 years later thanks to something called Williams Rule.Williams Rule \"allows prosecutors to bring in prior bad acts, not to show that this is a bad person, because that would violate the defendant's right to a fair trial, but to show that the prior conduct was so similar to the thing she's being charged with that it amounts as an MO — it's her pattern,\" Aronberg said. He says a judge would still need to admit it into evidence, but with how unique antifreeze poisoning is, \"I think they'll admit it,\" Aronberg said.The sheriff's office tells me they are going to review every case where Adamo is a suspect.

WATCH BELOW: 'It does seem to track along economic lines,' Edwin Ferguson tells WPTV School board member raises concern over kindergarten readiness He brought up the issue during Tuesday’s Delray Beach Commission meeting, saying it’s time to focus on how to better prepare young learners before they enter school.The presentation only contained data from four public schools within Ferguson’s district.“The issue is what we can do to help encourage, foster and sustain a greater level of preparedness,” Ferguson said.He told me students are entering school without vital knowledge.“There is an assessment that’s done in the kindergarten year where you check to see things such as can a child hold a pen or pencil properly,\" Ferguson noted. \"Do they recognize their name? Do they understand colors, can you count to 50 or 100.” Ferguson said when students fail to meet those metrics, it slows their learning curve.“Things they should be learning going into kindergarten, going into the first grade, they’re not able to learn that just yet,” he said.He said the numbers highlight deeper issues, including what’s happening inside the home before children even reach the classroom.“It does seem to track along economic lines, so in the more affluent areas of the county, you find that there’s a higher kindergarten readiness,\" Ferguson said. \"And in areas where the household income is lower, you see a lower kindergarten score.”Ferguson is urging families to take advantage of local programs that can help bridge the gap. Those include applying for Florida’s Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten (VPK) program and accessing the Birth to Pre-K Literacy Parent Resource Hub.He also encourages parents to read aloud with their children, engage in conversations about books and connect reading to real-life experiences.We contacted the Palm Beach County School District about the decline, a district spokesperson said they are working on providing that data.You can read the full report here. );",

This comes after a fatal crash on Florida's Turnpike this past summer that killed three people in St. Lucie County.The legislation, introduced by U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., comes two months after the Turnpike crash sparked national conversations about commercial trucking safety. Investigators said the driver, Harjinder Singh, made an illegal U-turn, leading to the deadly wreck.WATCH BELOW: US Senate bill targets English proficiency for truckers US Senate bill targets English proficiency for truckers According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Singh was issued a non-domiciled commercial driver's license out of California, but was not proficient in English and failed roadway signage tests. \"That accident brought this to the forefront,\" said Lewie Pugh, executive vice president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association and a truck driver himself. Pugh has been pushing lawmakers on Capitol Hill for stricter regulations. \"Truckers haul everything from toilet paper to bombs,\" Pugh said. \"You need to be able to communicate with first responders; some of that's life and death.\"The proposed bill would strengthen enforcement by mandating immediate \"out-of-service\" orders for drivers who fail English proficiency exams. This would effectively codify President Donald Trump's executive orders from earlier this year.\"The next administration could go back and roll back a lot of these rules and regulations with the stroke of a pen,\" Pugh said. \"So it pretty much strengthens and makes them permanent.\" Feds will withhold $40M from California for not enforcing trucker English requirements However, the Florida Immigration Coalition opposes the legislation, arguing it would harm experienced workers during challenging economic times. \"Enforcing English-language proficiency for commercial truck drivers risks sidelining thousands of experienced workers at the worst possible time,\" the coalition stated. \"With tariffs disrupting trade, the dollar weakening, and unemployment at a four-year high, we cannot afford to shrink our workforce or further strain supply chains.\"The coalition emphasized that immigrant drivers \"at various levels of bilingualism and English-language acquisition have kept America running for decades, safely delivering goods that keep shelves stocked and families fed.\" They argue that individual language issues should be addressed by employers rather than federal government intervention.Pugh maintains that the focus should remain on safety rather than perfect English skills. \"You don't have to speak the King's English to drive a truck,\" Pugh said. \"You just need to be fluent enough; this is completely about safety.\"The bill currently sits on the Senate floor pending committee review, debate and a possible vote.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

By: Tyler Hatfield Posted and last updated PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — WPTV is learning about some pushback to bring a professional soccer team to the Treasure Coast.Hundreds of people have signed an online petition opposing the plan to build a 6,000-seat stadium for a new United Soccer League (USL) team in Port St. Lucie.WATCH BELOW: Petition seeks to stop construction of 6,000-seat soccer stadium Petition seeks to stop construction of 6,000-seat soccer stadium The stadium is one component of the 46-acre Walton & One project, aimed at turning eastern Port St. Lucie into a walkable, mixed-use destination.The city has agreed to contribute up to $27.5 million in tax increment revenue toward the construction of a new soccer stadium. These funds will not come from the city's general budget, but from increases in property tax revenue, known as TIF (tax increment financing), generated over time and used to reinvest in the area.However, more than 700 people signed a petition expressing their concerns about the stadium.The petition points to traffic concerns on Walton Road and U.S. Highway 1 and the $27 million the city is investing in the construction of the stadium.Some people said that money should be invested in parks and infrastructure. How will a new soccer stadium impact the Port St. Lucie economy But neighbors along Walton Road, like Ben and Debbie Wingeier, told WPTV they're excited for the stadium and the impact it will have on the community.\"I like soccer,\" said Ben Wingeier. \"I think it'll do a lot for the town.\"But a few doors down, Timothy Mason said the growth in the city is too much. Mason said the new stadium will add more traffic.\"I feel like we have enough here,\" said Mason. \"We have too much going on, too much building going on, and not enough leaving from the areas for the preserves and things like that.\"WPTV took these concerns to Port St. Lucie city spokesperson Scott Samples.Samples said the soccer team, as part of their operating agreement, will have to work with Port St. Lucie police for traffic mitigation, similar to arrangements with the New York Mets at their spring training facility in St. Lucie West. Port St. Lucie awarded professional soccer team \"We've got some precedent in place on how we can try to minimize the impact of traffic during game days,\" Samples said.Samples added the team will also need to complete a traffic study for development.The $27.5 million investment, Samples said, comes from a pot of money that can only be used for revitalization in the Walton & One CRA District.\"That money cannot be used to build a road in North Port St. Lucie or a park in West Port St. Lucie,\" Samples said.There is no set timeline for when construction on the stadium will begin, but soccer matches are expected to begin in 2027.As of Thursday afternoon, the petition had received 712 signatures.Read more of WPTV's coverage on the announcement of a new professional soccer team in Port St. Lucie: Port St Lucie How will new soccer stadium impact the Port St. Lucie economy?

We all love it,\" said Martha Parker. \"The more cars and density that you have, the more, the harder it is to move around—Less safe for pedestrians and cyclists.\"Parker has called Boca Raton home her whole life and is calling for more shops after Phase II of the project reduced retail space from 37,399 square feet to 8,632 square feet.\"There's no Ulta's, there's no Marshalls or TJ Maxx,\" stated Parker. \"Just the stuff that you would want on a day-to-day basis.\"Phase I of the project brought two eight-story towers with 346 units on 171 W Camino Real.

The plan would’ve also included restaurant, office, and business space, but after discussion, city leaders put those plans on hold.\"I think the retail reduction was a real big issue,\" said Yvette Drucker. \"I think that is an issue because we are trying to create that vibrancy, and I want that downtown, I want that walkability, I want that access.\"Fran Nachals and Marc Widger also agreed to postpone the project and have developers make changes more suitable for their city.\"Is it true to the vision of the downtown? For me right now, it isn't,\" stated Nachals. \"I know that they can come up with something better than this.\"City leaders and developers will meet to discuss phase II next month. );",
