The comments sparked intense debate about free speech and appropriate conduct for elected officials.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Palm Beach County School Board member defends controversial comments at heated meeting \"The last 30 days or so have been somewhat interesting, as evidenced by the heckler in the back. But there is not much that I would change about it. I chose my words at last month's meeting carefully, and I'm choosing my words carefully now,\" Ferguson said.The public comment period drew passionate responses from both sides. Some community members demanded Ferguson step down from his position.\"I'm calling on you to step down,\" Ashley Lebald said.Others defended Ferguson's right to express his opinions and urged him to remain in his role.\"Don't you dare resign,\" one supporter said.Another speaker backed Ferguson's stance, saying he spoke truthfully about protecting school employees.\"He spoke the truth, and I respect him for that. Now, apparently, some people want to punish Ferguson for speaking up for teachers and all people who work for the school board. That is not what democracy looks like,\" the speaker said.Critics argued Ferguson's characterization of Kirk was inaccurate and divisive.\"Ferguson said something that a lot of us felt was not truthful. He had the right to express an opinion. But where the divisiveness lies at this point is we don't believe that his calling Charlie Kirk racist or a bigot is representative of the truth in any way,\" another community member said.After the meeting, Ferguson told me he has no intention of resigning and continues to stand by his previous comments.\"It was never a thought in my mind to step down,\" Ferguson said.Ferguson acknowledged the deep divide in opinions but remained firm in his position.\"It's obvious to me that I'm 100% right in this regard and they believe they are 100% right too,\" Ferguson said. ; }).then();",

We all love it,” said Martha Parker. “The more cars and density that you have, the more, the harder it is to move around—Less safe for pedestrians and cyclists.”Parker has called Boca Raton home her whole life and is calling for more shops after Phase II of the project reduced retail space from 37,399 square feet to 8,632 square feet.“There’s no Ulta’s, there’s no Marshalls or TJ Maxx,” stated Parker. “Just the stuff that you would want on a day-to-day basis.”Phase I of the project brought two eight-story towers with 346 units on 171 W Camino Real. In Phase II, developers wanted to reduce retail to add 394 more residential units.“We are downtown. Without density, and I understand that word causes heartburn for some, but without density, we will never have a vibrant downtown,” said Ele Zachariades, the developers’ attorney.Developers spent more than $3 million to better traffic, including new turn lanes and bike paths. The plan would’ve also included restaurant, office, and business space, but after discussion, city leaders put those plans on hold.“I think the retail reduction was a real big issue,” said Yvette Drucker. “I think that is an issue because we are trying to create that vibrancy and I want that downtown, I want that walkability, I want that access.”Fran Nachals and Marc Widger also agreed to postpone the project and have developers make changes more suitable for their city.“Is it true to the vision of the downtown? For me right now, it isn’t,” stated Nachals. “I know that they can come up with something better than this.”City leaders and developers will meet to discuss phase II next month. ; }).then();",

No. We need to either convert his heart or remove him,” Guardiola added.When asked in an interview with WPTV last month about possible repercussions for his comments, Ferguson doubled down.“I'm not racist. I don't promote racist ideologies or anything like that so based on my understanding on the groundwork, the rules of the road I should say, no I'm not too worried about that,” he said.He asserts that his track record on the board has been commendable. “Being a racist is not a protected group of people,” he said.Dedrick Straghn of the South Palm Beach County NAACP voiced the sentiment of many in support of Ferguson.“We're here today to let opts = {email: em , contactlist: '1108847b-4cd4-4e79-b9d4-f3808dbf02c5'}; }).then();",

    "content": "NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates New bill to repeal Florida's 'free kill' law clears first hurdle but caps are being discussed Families say current law prevents lawsuits over deadly medical mistakes based on age and marital status File By: Katie LaGrone Posted Florida lawmakers took the first steps today to repeal what critics call the state's \"free kill\" law, marking the latest attempt to end legislation that prevents some families from suing over deadly medical mistakes.The effort comes months after lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a full repeal last session, only to watch Governor Ron DeSantis veto the measure amid concerns from the healthcare industry.WATCH KATIE LAGRONE'S COVERAGE BELOW: New bill to repeal Florida's 'free kill' law clears first hurdle but caps are being discussed Republican Representative Dana Trabulsy of Fort Pierce opened Wednesday’s House Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee meeting with a reference to the past, hoping this session lawmakers will once again approve the bill that ends a measure preventing certain families from suing for pain and suffering over deadly medical negligence.\"You should be feeling a little deja vu; you heard this exact bill last year in this committee,\" Trabulsy stated as she presented HB 6003. Families call it Florida's ‘free kill’ law since the exception only applies to those whose loved one wasn't married and at least 25 years old when they died. We’ve been reporting on the law since 2023. \"To discover justice is based on age and marital status is inconceivable,\" said Daryl Perrit, whose 29-year-old son died of a blood clot after what Perrit called a series of medical mistakes.Cindy Jenkins' daughter, Taylor, had just turned 25 when she died in a hospital in 2023 after being rear-ended at a traffic light. Jenkins believes her daughter’s death could have been prevented if doctors hadn’t misdiagnosed a brain injury.“I’ve lost a child to this. The doctors got a free pass. I will forever refer to this as Florida’s free kill law,” she said to lawmakers.Most, if not all, the families who spoke before lawmakers in the state capitol on Wednesday had been there before.Marcie Scheppler has been sharing her son JoJo's story to lawmakers for six years. JoJo, who had Down syndrome and autism, died of septic shock. Scheppler said it happened after she brought him to a hospital, but the staff ignored him.\"We shouldn't be protecting bad actors,\" Scheppler said to lawmakers about how the current exception is not just unfair and discriminatory to families but keeps bad doctors from being held accountable.But those who oppose repealing the law believe eliminating the exception without capping how much families can sue for will wreak havoc on Florida's healthcare system and scare doctors away.\"If this gets approved, I will quietly retire,\" said one Tallahassee orthopedic surgeon who voiced concerns about how the bill paves the way for more lawsuits and higher medical malpractice premiums.“The more we pay out in losses, the higher premiums we have to have,” said Mark Delegal, a lobbyist and attorney for The Doctor’s Company, which is the nation’s largest insurer of physicians.Among the law’s original intents was to keep malpractice premium costs down. Florida currently leads the country in malpractice premium costs. Families argue this is an example of how the exception has failed to accomplish what it was created to do. Opponents believe this is more reason to keep the provision in place and prevent more lawsuits and rising rates.The latest legislative battle comes just months after Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed a similar bill last session, echoing concerns from the healthcare industry.\"It would cause malpractice insurance premiums to skyrocket, the folks that we talked to universally said that,\" DeSantis said back in May during a press conference over the veto. The governor said he could support a repeal if a bill included caps on damages that can be collected.On Wednesday, while the bill moved swiftly through its first committee hearing, a few lawmakers acknowledged the need for a balance.\"I have concerns about making insurance affordable. I hope reasonable limits will find its way,\" said Representative Dean Black of Jacksonville.But what's reasonable remains a question both sides will continue making their case for.A companion bill has yet to be introduced in the Florida Senate.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

By: Jamie Ostroff Posted and last updated The federal government shutdown could impact a lawsuit challenging the construction of a state-run immigration detention facility in the middle of the Everglades, known as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"WATCH BELOW: DOJ seeks pause in 'Alligator Alcatraz,' citing government shutdown DOJ seeks pause in 'Alligator Alcatraz,' citing government shutdown Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice are asking a federal appeals court to stop all proceedings in the environmental lawsuit, writing in a filing that they can't argue the case if they're not getting paid during the shutdown.The lawsuit was brought by Friends of the Everglades, the Miccosukee Tribe and other environmental groups in June. They argue the state of Florida and the federal government broke the law when they built the detention facility in the middle of the Big Cypress National Preserve without first assessing how it would impact the environment.Both governments argue Alligator Alcatraz is a state project and the state doesn't have to follow the National Environmental Policy Act, a statute that applies to federal projects.In August, a district court judge in Miami ordered the dismantling of the detention facility within 60 days. However, the court of appeals paused that order in early September, and the facility remains operational.In response, Friends of the Everglades and their fellow plaintiffs filed a motion urging the appeals court to keep the case moving through the federal government shutdown.\"Real damage is continuing to happen to the Everglades, and we see that the federal government and state government are making Alligator Alcatraz a top priority,\" said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. \"So we would hope that they would allocate attorneys who are working to keeping this moving, so we can have the courts decide.\"Earlier this month, the federal government approved $608 million via the Department of Homeland Security to reimburse the state for Alligator Alcatraz. Questions about how much of that money has been disbursed and whether the shutdown will impact that disbursement have not been answered by DHS.Friends of the Everglades filed a new lawsuit against the State of Florida Tuesday, claiming state officials violated Florida's public records laws by not providing records on the financial arrangements between the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which oversees Alligator Alcatraz, and the federal government.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

    "content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — A Florida House panel on Wednesday received an update on the progress of the My Safe Florida Home program, and also had a few questions about how effective it's been on lowering home insurance premiums. Steven Fielder, the program's director, presented some new data to the House Subcommittee on Insurance and Banking on Wednesday. WATCH BELOW: Lawmakers question effectiveness of My Safe Florida Home program From 2022 to 2025, the program has been funded with over $800 million and has awarded grants for home hardening to 40,719 homeowners in the state. Out of those homeowners, only 20,995 reported a reduction in premiums, with 12,154 saying their costs were stable and 5,520 saying their insurance costs went up. \"It's a billion dollars. That doesn't seem like it's really gone a long way to really help out Floridians,\" said state Rep. Adam Botana, R-Bonita Springs. Fielder responded to questions about the program's effectiveness by pointing out that the grant's improvements also played a role in many homeowners avoiding nonrenewal of policies. \"We were asked to implement this program to drive down the rates,\" Fielder said. \"Our goal and desire is, we're pushing against the flow as best we can.\" He also pointed out that those homeowners who did see lower premiums had an average savings of $938 in 2024. As of Oct. 8, the My Safe Florida Home program this year has approved 4,216 grants under new rules that prioritize low- and moderate-income homeowners.

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyLake Worth Beach Lake Worth Beach residents prepare for another fight over 826 Sunset Drive property The 4-acre property, surrounded by single-family homes, has long been at the center of a debate over how it should be used WPTV By: Vannia Joseph Posted and last updated LAKE WORTH BEACH, Fla. — What looks like an empty stretch of land at 826 Sunset Drive in Lake Worth Beach has been anything but quiet for the past 20 years.The four-acre property, surrounded by single-family homes, has long been at the center of a debate over how it should be used — and tonight, that fight is resurfacing once again.WATCH: Neighbors fear new zoning could set stage for more development Residents prepare for fight over property after 20-year debate reignites Months after city commissioners voted against a plan to build 42 townhomes on the site, the issue is back before city leaders. City staff are now recommending approval of a new rezoning request that would change the property to a single-family and two-family residential (SF-TF-14) district.According to city documents, the rezoning would correct a long-standing annexation error that dates back nearly two decades. The city says the land, annexed in 2005, was never given a proper zoning designation. The proposed change, officials say, would allow for the development of sixteen single-family homes and bring the site into compliance with Lake Worth Beach's comprehensive plan and land development regulations. But longtime residents say they're skeptical — and exhausted.\"We've been fighting this for about 20 years, so I think a lot of us are feeling tired, a little frustrated—that this is the third time that it's come up with the same exact zoning,\" said Amy Mihelich, who lives nearby. Neighbors fear the new zoning could set the stage for denser development in the future, far beyond the 16 homes currently proposed.\"There's a discrepancy with the developer's submission for 16 single-family homes versus the zoning that they are requesting,\" Mihelich said. \"Our concern is that they are just going to flip it and bring in much denser development once the zoning is passed.\" Residents also argue that any high-density project would harm the environment and the character of their neighborhood — citing 100-year-old trees, wildlife like gopher tortoises, and already narrow residential streets that could see more traffic. PREVIOUS STORY: 20-year debate closer to being settled at Lake Worth Beach commission meeting City commission to decide on development on Sunset Drive \"The only way to get in is through this driveway,\" said Ruth Lynch, another resident. \"We're not against development—it's just development with lower density, with the consistency of this neighborhood.\"The site has a complicated history.The land was annexed into the city in 2005, with initial rezoning approvals granted to Sunset Drive Holdings, LLC.In 2006, the city approved a Medium Density Residential land use designation — but that decision was challenged by residents.By 2009, the city reversed its prior approvals.Since then, Lake Worth Beach has updated its comprehensive plan and land use maps, but the Sunset Drive property has remained without an official zoning district.The new rezoning, according to the agenda item, would finally resolve that oversight. But for residents who've fought this battle for decades, there's still lingering mistrust.\"If it's going to be 16 homes, what are the assurances that we have that that's only going to be developed for 16 homes?\" Mihelich asked.The Planning and Zoning Board will discuss the proposed rezoning Wednesday at 6 p.m. at Lake Worth Beach City Hall. Any recommendation from the board will still need final approval from the city commission in a future meeting. Earlier this year, residents rallied against a separate plan that would have built 42 townhomes on the property. That proposal was ultimately voted down by city commissioners after dozens of residents showed up at a public hearing to oppose it.Mihelich says many in the community say they're not opposed to development — they just want a plan that respects the ecosystem, history, and neighborhood character of the area. ; }).then();",

But in recent years, the building has fallen into disrepair. City officials now estimate it needs roughly $250,000 in renovations after sustaining water damage in 2024.“When I found out there was the potential of moving this historic building and spending millions of dollars to move it, when the money wasn’t spent to keep up the programming for it, it was a huge concern for me,” O’Rourke said. WPTV's Ange Toussaint In 2024, the Boca Raton City Council voted to relocate the Singing Pines and Rickard’s House Cottages, to Meadows Park for $1.1 million. That decision was meant with pushback.“Why spend millions to move something really so important and not know what you’re going to do with it,” O’Rourke said.The museum site sits within the footprint of Boca Raton’s proposed downtown government campus project, a plan that has drawn strong opposition from residents.Under the updated proposal from developers Terra and Frisbie, the Singing Pines Museum would remain at its current location.However, the city says no restoration work will begin until the question of relocation is fully settled.“I do think it’s the responsibility of the city to keep these special activities that are so important to the community,” O’Rourke said. ; }).then();",

Trump is returning to Washington after visiting his Mar-a-Lago resort. By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — Several federal and local law enforcement agencies are preparing for President Donald Trump's return to Mar-a-Lago this Friday.It's his first visit to Palm Beach County in a few months. The president's visit comes as multiple government agencies performed security exercises this week, as well as warnings about road and airspace closures around the property.WATCH BELOW: NORAD prepares for Trump's return to Mar-a-Lago, possible airspace violations NORAD prepares for air space violations during Trump's visit to Palm Beach County Most notably, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is warning pilots about the temporary flight restrictions in effect over the president's property during his visit. Those flight restrictions include a ban on all aircraft within a 10 nautical mile radius around Mar-a-Lago, with the exception of approved law enforcement, military aircraft supporting the Secret Service, approved air ambulance flights or regularly scheduled commercial airline flights with proper Transportation Security Administration clearances.WPTV reporter Ethan Stein previously reported on a trend of private aircraft violating those rules, causing fighter jets to scramble across Palm Beach County to intercept various planes. NORAD said it intercepted about 25 planes this year that broke the temporary flight restrictions in place over Mar-a-Lago. However, a spokesperson told WPTV the number of interceptions dropped significantly after it invited WPTV to Homestead Air Reserve Base to show its capabilities in March.Lt. Colonel Robert Ice, whose job at NORAD is to watch planes that violate the airspace and then help select the resources used against the potential threat, said he wants pilots to continue checking temporary flight restrictions released by the FAA called Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs). He said he's concerned pilots get complacent, which causes mistakes to happen that then involve his agency.\"Nine-nine times out of 100 it works out just according to plan,\" Ice said. \"But the day you don't check, and there's something that would have affected your route of flight. Now you're going to end up in a situation where you've got a helicopter or fighter jet off your wing.\"Airports like the one in Lantana have signs and warnings posted all over the runway and hangar with information about Mar-a-Lago flight restrictions. But, Ice said he's concerned because the amount of air traffic in South Florida increases the probability that one pilot could make a mistake.The only visible change that WPTV saw at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday is that the parking lot closer to Trump's residence has been moved further back. However, the town of Palm Beach said this week that its police department is performing security exercises with the United States Secret Service.\"Members of the public may hear simulated gunfire and see increased law enforcement presence in and around the Mar a Lago Club during these exercises,\" a notice from the town said.The town of Palm Beach said it will close roads around Mar-a-Lago starting Friday until further notice. That includes South Ocean Boulevard (State Road A1A) between South County Road and Southern Boulevard on Friday morning. Those road closures will remain until further notice, town officials said.South Ocean Boulevard will be closed between South County Road and Southern Boulevard beginning Friday at 5 a.m. ; }).then();",
