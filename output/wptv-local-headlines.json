    "content": "MoneyConsumer Dining out becomes the new Thanksgiving trend for families OpenTable data shows Thanksgiving dinner reservations increased 13% compared to last year WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted DELRAY BEACH, Fla — Thanksgiving may be rooted in home-cooked meals and family gatherings, but a growing number of Americans are celebrating the holiday in new ways. This year, many diners opted for restaurant reservations and takeout instead of spending hours cooking at home.WATCH BELOW: New trend? Numbers show more people dining out on Thanksgiving Dining out becomes the new Thanksgiving trend for families Downtown Delray Beach was packed on Thanksgiving night, reflecting a nationwide shift. Several families said convenience, cost and lifestyle changes are reshaping how they approach the holiday.\"We chose to go out on the town,\" said diner Briana Lutzi. \"Dining out is a good option,\" diner Kelsey Lutzi added. \"It's affordable, you can get any meal you want.\"Christopher Bonilla, who is originally from New England, says the difference is striking. \"Up north, we do the traditional home family, home cooking, stay at home, traditional Thanksgiving dinner,\" Bonilla said. Celebrating in Florida feels different. \"I think it has something to do with the weather because it's warmer, people want to be out, 'Look at me, it's Thanksgiving, I’m biking; I just came from the beach,' It's a whole different environment,\" Bonilla said.The trend extends well beyond Florida. WPTV Restaurants in Delray Beach were busy serving diners on Thanksgiving. Popmenu, a restaurant technology company, reports that 53% of U.S. consumers planned to order takeout for Thanksgiving this year. OpenTable data shows Thanksgiving dinner reservations increased 13% compared to last year.Restaurant owners are seeing the shift firsthand. Rahein Jones of True Vegan restaurant said this Thanksgiving was one of his busiest nights.\"In a four-hour time frame, we made more in that four-hour time frame than we've done on days we've been open all day,\" Jones said. With fewer restaurants open on the holiday, demand grew quickly. \"People don't want to cook; people want good food, and they want someone to cook for them,\" Jones said.OpenTable listed 216 restaurants open in Delray Beach on Thanksgiving, underscoring how many families are moving away from traditional home gatherings.Some diners say the changes reflect deeper shifts in family life and culture. \"It's an interesting generation now. A lot of people aren't around family,\" said resident Briana Lutzi.Still, others believe the heart of the holiday remains unchanged. \"At the end of the day, what matters is you are with the people you love, and that love you, and you celebrate our country and our tradition together,\" said Bonilla.Researchers expect these trends to continue as younger generations take the lead on holiday planning and as food prices remain high.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fl. — Thanksgiving is a day of gratitude — a moment to recognize what and who carries us through the year. This year, people across South Florida spent that day serving others, handing out hot meals, warm smiles, and a little hope to those who need it most.At the corner of Atlantic and Fifth avenues in Delray Beach, Thanksgiving dinner looked a little different than most. There were no table settings or warm homes, yet gratitude was felt, and it was real.WATCH BELOW: Volunteers serve hope alongside Thanksgiving meals Volunteers in Delray Beach serve hope alongside Thanksgiving meals Hot meals came in Styrofoam containers — homemade and hand-delivered by Bill Caesar, a retired teacher who started the nonprofit Coming Back to Give Back. \"My mom, she was always a giver, and my aunt, they used to always give and help out,\" said Caesar. \"So we started this thing where we fed the homeless every Thursday, my mom and my aunt, and so when my mom, my aunt, they passed on, we just kept the tradition going. And, you know, we were always taught (that) if you have a chance, give back.\" Now he comes for them — the people who know what it's like to live without life's essentials. They've gone without food, without shelter, without safety or stability. Here, a hot meal isn't routine — it's relief. A warm conversation isn't background noise — it's someone finally seeing you— and that wasn't taken for granted. \"I love to see them happy, you know, and they see me coming, and they know they're gonna get a hot meal. So I'm bringing delight to them. They bring joy to me. I'd say it's a blessing for both of us,\" said Caesar. For people like Fred and Paris, who are down on their luck, it wasn't just about the meal. It was connecting with a familiar face.Robert, now sleeping on that street, worked for 35 years. His disability checks no longer cover the cost of living. A hand-delivered plate he received on Thursday may be his first hot meal in a long time. It could be his last for a while, too.Sam once relied on SNAP benefits to keep him steady. Now he's not sure when or if the next meal will come.Rudy simply couldn't keep up with rent. The Delray Beach native was priced out of his own town.For people like Rolle, who is jobless and frustrated, sometimes someone just showing up can be enough to save.These are the stories we often don't hear. These are the moments we often don't see — moments of humanity both raw and inspiring. Moments of kindness that can both touch a life and transform it.Moments that teach us: when we pause and just listen, we hear fear, sure, and hunger, yes, but also resilience, humor and hope. We hear stories that put faces, voices and dignity back into a problem too often reduced to numbers.Sometimes just listening is the first step toward giving us all a reason to be grateful again.So as volunteers took their seats beside the people they call family, their Thanksgiving meal began.Though it may look different than others, every bite carried gratitude — and somehow— felt fuller than anything found at traditional tables.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

Sweeting-Mashkow’s.“What makes it so special is just the fact that she was given that sergeant rank for giving her life in the line of duty,” said Castro. “Her selfless service and her heroism.”Sgt. Sweeting Mashkow was shot and killed Friday while serving an eviction notice in the Bermuda Club Community off A1A. Castro ties in his roles as a police officer and forensic composite artist into his work.“You’re constantly working, constantly drawing facial features, so about 10 years ago, coming up on 10 years, I did my first one and everybody seemed to enjoy it,” said Castro.He said after learning about Sgt. Sweeting Mashkow’s tragedy, he was deeply moved. He learned about it on social media and immediately began sketching.“It’s sad to think that she was on the job for 25 years,” said Castro.He also created a portrait for the three fallen Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies last year.“What do you hope loved ones say or feel when they see this portrait that you created?” asked WPTV’s Zitlali Solache.“I hope they know there are people like me all the way up in Pennsylvania and as far west as California that are praying for her family and wishing them the best during this tragic time — especially around the holidays,’ replied Castro.The goal is for the art to be a piece that the family holds dearly. Castro said he will also begin sketching David Long’s piece on Tuesday. Long is the locksmith also involved in the fatal eviction call.“I think that’s what makes it special, just because she doesn’t have any photos. She will never have a photo as a sergeant,’ said Castro. “This may be the only one, so I just hope to know the family enjoys it and they hang it proud on their wall.”Castro says he will be in touch with Sheriff Eric Flowers to ship the painting over.",
