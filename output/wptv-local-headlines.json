She’s preserving her heritage and sharing it with others.WATCH: Julissa Hernandez says dance is about preserving a legacy How one local woman shares her roots through movement “A piece of my heart stays with West Palm Beach because I just love the people and how open they are to wanting to experience Latin culture from my perspective,” said Hernandez.Originally from New York, Hernandez moved to South Florida bringing her two-time Salsa Summit champion experience to Palm Beach County.“It’s gotten so diverse so much so that I’ve met so many people through dancing, so many people that I’ve connected with because they just want to learn about our culture,\" she said. Hernandez leads a class full of dancers in salsa, merengue, and bachata. She also explains when her passion first started.“Music was a part of our lives. My parents used to dance in New York,” said Hernandez. \"They loved it so it just kind of transitioned into our family.”Now, she is guiding younger generations to embrace their roots while inspiring a broader audience.“They don’t have to speak the language, they don’t even have to understand the music. As long as long as they can feel the rhythm, I’m able to guide them through it so that they can enjoy it in any part of the world they’re in.”For Hernandez, dancing is more than just movement, it's about preserving a legacy, passing it down one step at a time.“This month just kind of shines more, but I really enjoy doing that every month of the year,” said Hernandez.Hernandez holds a four-week Latin Dance Course for $130 and also teaches private lessons. ; }).then();",

Ian Hodges, a 16-year-old junior, is one of six winners chosen out of hundreds in the ENOUGH! Plays to End Gun Violence national competition. His original 10-minute play, 'Nobody Cares About Death,' explores the emotional and societal toll of gun violence through the lens of an unusual narrator. WATCH: Hodges says his play is 'very much about apathy' Teen playwright’s work on gun violence selected for national stage “My play 'Nobody Cares About Death' follows the literal personification of death, a grim reaper-like character as he’s written a book and doing a TV interview quite like this one,” Hodges said. “And he’s talking about the horrible, horrible sense of gun violence in this country.” The play focuses on what Hodges describes as a growing indifference toward the staggering number of children and teenagers who die from gun violence.\"'Nobody Cares About Death' is very much about apathy,” he said. “Death is exhausted, he’s tired of this and a large portion of the play is him discussing the children.” Hodges said the idea was inspired by an experience in fourth grade when he was accidentally locked out of of his classroom’s designated safe space during an active shooter drill.“You realize during those moments when it seems all too real for me... that death doesn’t discriminate. When faced with a gun, anyone has an equal chance of death,” Hodges said. “Gun violence is a terrifying thing that most people my age are constantly thinking about. It is the number one cause of death of children and teenagers in America.”The play has resonated not only with the judges, but also with his mother, Wendy Hodges. She said the subject matter strikes a chord for parents.“It really makes you think and it makes you feel, and as proud as I am of him, this subject is very painful,” she said.Still, Wendy Hodges explained she is proud of her son for using his voice to address a difficult topic and spark conversation.On Monday, Hodges’ play will be performed during a nationwide reading event. “I want the audience to come away and realize, students like me, lives are in their hands,” Hodges said. “We don’t get to vote, they do.\"The ENOUGH! initiative encourages young writers to use creative expression to address the issue of gun violence in a 10-minute play. The national project seeks to raise awareness through art and amplify youth voices in a pressing national conversation. All six winning plays will be staged in more than 30 states, three countries and more than 70 theaters. One of those performances will be at StarStruck Theatre in Stuart at 7 p.m. Tickets can be purchased online here. ; }).then();",

When asked what message she would send to county leaders, Rashke simply stated, \"Help me correct this problem.\"\"I don’t have any background on any of this, I guess be held by the hand a little bit,\" Rashke explained, reflecting the confusion many homeowners face in similar situations. \"I did have somebody from the county come out to my property, he wasn't able to tell me that day where the problem is with it and what I needed to do to correct it. He was going to go back to the office, read the file and get back to me but I have not heard back from him and that's the answer that I need.\" Bringing attention to the issue In response to her concerns, WPTV took her situation to Palm Beach County Code Enforcement.We got a response that uncovered her driveway extension now conflicts with the right-of-way for traffic.County staff informed WPTV that she might need to remove a portion of the driveway extension, but they also offered their support, proposing to assist her step-by-step in creating a compliance plan.\"This is good news, I need it to go farther than 'fill out this application, pay this fee.' I need to know exactly what in my driveway is in violation\" Rashke said, hopeful about the proposed plan.WPTV pressed the county about what would happen with fines if the issue isn't resolved in time.They responded with: \"Once she has corrected the violation, if she does not meet the magistrate's compliance deadline, and there are assessed fines, staff will also assist her with submitting an application for a fine modification that is also adjudicated by a magistrate.\" “I’m anxious to get this done with and put it behind me and make the county happy and me happy and everybody's happy,” she expressed. \"You do great work in helping the community.\" ; }).then();",

PBSO says in a social media post that between September and October, five incidents of vandalism were reported. They posted video of the suspect, who's described as a thin white male wearing a baseball cap, spray-painting the side of a building.

They say the vandalism has occurred between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. The graffiti comes weeks after the killing of political commentator Charlie Kirk, and as Jews commemorated Yom Kippur, a sacred holiday. The suspect’s latest target was a Walgreens. By late Thursday, cleaning crews were removing the graffiti from the building. Emails to Walgreens’ media department were not immediately returned. ADL Lake Worth residents strongly condemned the acts.“It’s just wrong! People don’t need to be seeing that.

Ron DeSantis nears property tax proposal, floats special session amid rising calls for reform Any change would require voters' approval on November 2026 ballot Gov. Ron DeSantis, Rumble Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at a news conference held in Jacksonville on Oct. 1, 2025. By: Forrest Saunders Posted and last updated TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida's debate over property taxes is entering a new phase, with Gov. Ron DeSantis signaling his administration is close to unveiling a sweeping reform plan. He's even hinting that a special legislative session could be called to push it forward.Speaking this week, DeSantis said his team is finalizing a proposal he wants \"big\" enough to survive court challenges, legislative hurdles and voter scrutiny.WATCH BELOW: DeSantis nears property tax proposal, floats special session Gov. DeSantis nears property tax proposal, floats special session \"I'm focusing on the Florida resident. I'm focusing on people being able, you know, to own their own home without being squeezed by the property tax,\" DeSantis said while outlining a vision that would shield homesteads from property taxes while keeping levies in place on investors, snowbirds and short-term rental owners.The governor suggested new restrictions could also force local governments to direct property tax revenue strictly toward core services such as schools, police and fire — not what he described as \"equity officers or other programs.\"Any change would require voters' approval on the November 2026 ballot, where constitutional amendments need at least 60% support to pass. But first, lawmakers would need to approve the plan with a two-thirds majority. This is a hurdle DeSantis acknowledged while floating the idea of a summer 2026 special session.\"Right in the middle of the Republican primary season in July or August. Imagine that. I don't think a lot of these guys would want to vote the wrong way then,\" DeSantis said. Legislature Still in Early Stages The House Select Committee on Property Taxes, led by Reps. Vicki Lopez, R-Miami, and Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart, have been gathering testimony statewide but have yet to produce a concrete plan. Both chairs have emphasized the complexity of the issue, noting the state's 67 counties face vastly different fiscal realities.\"Any reduction in property taxes may, in fact, and probably will impact the level of services that they receive,\" Lopez said.Overdorf added that while options like rolling back values to 2022 levels and expanding exemptions are under discussion, no proposals have been finalized.\"Right now we're looking strictly at the property tax, and then proposals are going to be start rolling out here in the next month and a half month,\" he said.Lawmakers are expected to release proposals later this fall, potentially advancing more than one constitutional amendment along with companion bills. 'Republican math' or real relief? Lawmakers debate future of property taxes Skepticism From Experts Not everyone is convinced real reform is possible. Former GOP Sen. Jeff Brandes, now president of the Florida Policy Project, has criticized state leaders for offering rhetoric without substance.\"What in the world are we really going to do on property taxes? There's been no real proposal put out there. I keep challenging people … great, show me the real plan,\" Brandes said in a July interview.He warned that eliminating or significantly reducing property taxes would require difficult trade-offs, such as raising the sales tax or funneling state dollars into rural counties to replace lost revenue. That, he argued, could create political fights and threaten essential services like fire and police. Political Stakes Rising Despite the uncertainty, Republican leaders say action is overdue. Former House Speaker Paul Renner — who launched his campaign for governor last month — called for meaningful relief but urged caution.\"You have to balance it. You have to give people real relief. You also have to get 60%. And so if you go too far in a direction and you can’t get 60%, it's not going to pass,\" Renner said.For now, Floridians are left with more questions than answers: What form will relief take? Who will pay for it? And will lawmakers reconvene next summer to fast-track DeSantis' plan?What is clear is that property tax reform has become one of the hottest political issues in Florida, one that could shape not only the 2026 ballot — but also the next governor's race.

By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — A longtime Martin County teacher could be fired after calling conservative activist Charlie Kirk a “racist, misogynistic, fear-mongering neo-Nazi” on Facebook following Kirk’s assassination.WATCH BELOW: 'It's toxic for our democracy, and it's deeply unfair,' Lee Rowland tells WPTV Teacher faces firing over Charlie Kirk comments Superintendent Michael Maine has recommended the termination of Matthew Theobald, a 17-year educator at Spectrum Academy and president of the Martin County Education Association. It marks the perhaps first permanent disciplinary action of its kind in Florida since state officials began targeting teachers over online comments about Kirk.According to an investigation report obtained by WPTV, Theobald admitted writing the comments but said they were posted on his mother’s private Facebook page “within a discussion among personal acquaintances” and were not intended for public view. He also said he was not celebrating violence.Still, administrators concluded Theobald’s firing is warranted, citing “community concern,” loss of confidence in the profession and “the potential for students or families to feel unwelcome.” National News Social media posts on Charlie Kirk shooting cost jobs, business deals Justin Boggs Free speech advocates argue the decision crosses a constitutional line.“My God, this is unconstitutional, as all get out,” said Lee Rowland, executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship. Rowland is pointing to a Supreme Court ruling in 1987 that protected a law enforcement officer who faced discipline over comments about the Reagan assassination attempt.Supreme Court Justices then ruled her firing was a violation of her First Amendment Rights. \"Look, no matter how uncomfortable this makes you, it's protected speech under the First Amendment,\" said Rowland. \"There are very narrow categories of words that the government has any power to censor or limit, and they usually have to reach the level of something like a threat, right, a direct threat of violence.\" WATCH: Florida education commissioner issues warning to teachers over comments Florida leaders react after assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk Adam Goldstein, vice president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the district must prove Theobald’s words did more than upset the community.“The real question is what evidence does the school have that what they said prevented them from functioning in their role, or prevented the school from functioning in its role,” Goldstein said.Martin County is one of seven Florida districts WPTV has identified where teachers have been removed for comments about Kirk, following a directive from Florida's Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas. In a memo to superintendents, Kamoutsas warned he would investigate “every educator” who engages in “vile, sanctionable behavior,” adding that First Amendment rights “do not extend without limit into their professional duties.”WATCH BELOW: Florida fallout after Kirk assassination raises First Amendment concerns Florida fallout after Kirk assassination raises First Amendment concerns \"We do not want to give government the power to pick and choose, you know, the right ideas to express,\" said Rowland, criticizing that directive. \"This isn't how public employment is supposed to work,\" added Goldstein. The Martin County School District declined to answer questions on camera, but spokesperson Derek Lowe previously told WPTV's Joel Lopez, “I would say to leave their comments and thoughts off social media.”Lopez pressed back, asking the district about a Facebook post it made in tribute to Charlie Kirk and his family the day of his assassination. \"Do you think that was appropriate considering the conversation that we’re having now?\" Lopez asked. \"I think so, you know, we had two tragedies in addition to what happened to Charlie Kirk, there was also a shooting in Colorado that day,\" replied Lowe. \"We’re aware and mindful of the sentiment and, of course, feeling for people’s frustrations and disappointments.\"WATCH BELOW: 'I still believe in free speech but not hate speech,' Don Taddoni tells WPTV Martin County teacher removed from classroom after post about Charlie Kirk \"It's obviously a decisive topic whether you supported him or not, so should the conversation be why are we not taking a more neutral stance?\" Lopez pressed. \"I think it has to do more with the way people say things, the word choice that they are using,\" another district employee responded. Yet, Goldstein and Rowland still feel it crosses a legal line. \"It's unconstitutional. It's toxic for our democracy, and it's deeply unfair,\" said Rowland, \"for particularly public service servants, who are generally underpaid, to worry any neighbor, anyone who might have seen their Facebook page is going to call the principal.\" Theobald’s termination is not final. A pre-determination meeting will give him a final opportunity to present evidence, before the superintendent makes a decision.

    "content": "NewsTreasure CoastRegion Indian River County 'DEFUND THE POLICE MOVEMENT’: Indian River County Sheriff blames county leaders following budget debate Sheriff Eric Flowers shared a video on Youtube, voicing his frustrations about denied budget requests IRCSO Sheriff Flowers blames county leaders for cutting his request. By: Zitlali Solache Posted and last updated INDIAN RIVER COUNTY, Fla. — Indian River County Sheriff Eric Flowers is speaking out after county leaders slashed millions of dollars from his budget request.In a four-minute video on social media, Flowers claims county leaders are taking a ‘defund the police’ approach.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Indian River County Sheriff blames county leaders following budget debate “Today we start out, over $5 million short of the money we need to keep our community safe,” said Flowers.He blames county administrator John Titkanich for cutting his request. Flowers said the letter from Titkanich shows cuts made to ammunition, mental health for first responders, and more.“Folks, an unelected bureaucrat has told me, the elected sheriff of Indian River County, that mental health for first responders is not important, that dog food for our canines is not important.”The document shows cuts to uniforms, inmate meals, other investigative supplies, and more.“I never thought that in 2025, in the United States of America, in the state of Florida and especially in Indian River County, that we would ever see the defund the police movement come to our hometown,” said Flowers.Months ago, Flowers originally requested $14.6 million and then reduced his request to $12.2 million for the sheriff's office following debate with county commissioners. However, county leaders cut $5 million from the request, approving a roughly $86 million budget for the 2025/2026 fiscal year.“What they don’t realize is that there are items inside this budget that are directly related to protecting our schools, to protecting our children, and protecting our community ever since day,’ said Flowers. “We will not stop here. We are going to do everything legally possible to ensure that the operations to the Indian River County sheriff are properly funded.”WPTV’s Zitlali Solache reached out to the county for a statement:“Since taking office in 2020, the sheriff has seen his budget grow from $57.82 million to $85.77 million—an increase of nearly $28 million or 48%. The Sheriff’s Office now accounts for 53.6% of the County’s General Fund and is receiving 72% of all new General Fund revenue this fiscal year.” County leaders also added, “The board remains committed to fiscal responsibility and transparency while ensuring that public safety remains a top priority.” ; }).then();",
