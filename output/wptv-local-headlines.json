It’ll affect more than 160,000 people in Palm Beach County alone.WATCH: 'We're the ones that have the kitchens,' says Rodney Mayo Local business owner to offer free meals to SNAP recipients It’s pushing one local restaurateur to step in and lend a helping hand in a big way.Rodney Mayo, owner of Subculture Group and Hospitality Helping Hands, tells us starting Monday, each of his nine restaurant locations — and each of the Subculture coffee shops across Palm Beach County — will be offering one free meal a day to SNAP recipients. He says he’ll be launching a website on Saturday with detailed information like times, locations and how to get your meal if you need one. Mayo says while it doesn’t fix the problem, it’s a step in the right direction. He says with more than 30% of recipients being children — hopefully it’s a step that inspires other restaurant groups to jump in. “We can't count on the government or the city to do that,” said Mayo. \"They're not going to ramp up. But we're the ones that have the kitchens. We're the ones that know how to produce a lot of meals.

WATCH: Cyclists say they don't feel safe on Boca Raton roads Cyclists speak up for safer roads at Boca Raton town hall Ginger Phillips was one of several who attended, and said has seen the world on her bicycle.“I’ve ridden all over the world and I’ve been riding for decades,” said Phillips. “But in Boca Raton, I ride my bicycle on the sidewalk. First place in the world I’ve ever ridden on a sidewalk.” Phillips and others said the roads just don’t feel safe anymore and they’re pushing for changes on roadways. They add it’s a mix of unfollowed rules and lacking infrastructure that brought them to the town hall.“As these devices become more common, and they have, it’s essential that we all understand how to use them safely,” said Deputy Mayor Fran Nachlas. Layne Hollander rides the 11-mile El Rio trail daily but said it can feel dangerous.“The reason why we showed up today is because we’re a little saddened by when we cross the intersection, we don’t feel quite as safe,” said Hollander. Boca Raton 'IT SCARES ME': Electric bike safety concerns grow in Boca Raton Zitlali Solache Riders said it’s not just other cyclists; it’s reckless drivers and speeding that add to the risk. They’re calling for more enforcement and safety upgrades to roadways. “We have accidents all the time and they’re really not accidents, they are really caused by the high speed of cars,” said Phillips. “Right now, we just don’t have the infrastructure that people feel confident to be on the road with cars.”WPTV requested data from Boca Raton police officials, who said there have been four e-bike related crashes since April 2025. The city’s town hall included conversations, free helmets, giveaways, and a tour of a new bike safety intersection on NE Mizner Boulevard and NE Second Avenue — all an effort to create safer roadways.

Local organizations and individuals are rallying to provide much-needed aid.WATCH BELOW: 'We thank everyone for their overwhelming support,' Lincoln Lewis tells WPTV Nonprofit providing relief supplies to those in Jamaica after Hurricane Melissa On Wednesday, WPTV's Ange Toussaint spoke with Jamaican business owner Doug Gore, the owner of a shipping company on the island. As of Wednesday, he shared the grim reality. \"I'm just sitting here wondering when our ports are going to open back up to even receive goods,\" he said.With ports closed as of Wednesday and local airports also flooded and damaged, he worries what this will mean for the flow of aid at a time when it is desperately needed.He said areas like Reading and Montego Bay are facing significant challenges, with downed power lines blocking roads and causing extensive power outages.\"Right now we have our generator running for the last two days, we're all out of water, nobody has water out here,\" Gore said. “As much help as we can get from our neighbors is going to be needed.”Local organizations like Free Spirit Outreach have been stepping up to collect donations and provide assistance.

As soon as these items arrive, they’re ready to start distributing,\" he said.However, the organization is also facing significant financial challenges in getting these supplies to the people who need them most. Lewis explained they need tens of thousands of dollars to pay for a shipping container and a crew to deliver the donations.The urgency is palpable, as every moment counts for those on the ground. During a visit to the nonprofit's office, WPTV observed their dedicated team sorting through food, clothing, and other essential supplies.WATCH BELOW: 'It was very stressful; we just had to continue to pray,' Lakeesha Hawthorne tells WPTV Jamaican families reunited after losing contact during Melissa Stories of resilience are emerging from families affected by the hurricane. Simone Clarke-Cooper, a Kingston resident, said her area didn't receive much damage but parts of the island are unlivable.\"Everybody is saying we are ready to rebuild, we are down but we are not out, because we have proven before that we are a resilient nation, and we will be again,\" said Clarke-Cooper.Such determination shines through even as she acknowledges the catastrophic damage experienced by many.\"There are people here who have nothing but the shirts on their backs, so it's going to be really hard on them to rebuild,\" he said.Free Spirit Outreach is preparing to send donations as early as Friday, but they are urging businesses to join the cause.

Teachers at the now-defunct school weren't paid for about a month's worth of work at the private school in Fort Pierce. Each teacher has unpaid wages ranging from around $1,000 to $5,000, which they tell us is making it difficult to pay bills.WATCH: Former teacher at Fort Pierce school says she's struggling to get anyone on the phone Government shutdown affecting teachers from closed Fort Pierce private school “It just felt like I was just doing that [teaching] for no reason,” said Tayla King, a former preschool teacher at the school. “Like all that time that I put into working, like all of that was for nothing. Like I just wasted my time.\" King said she left her job at a different daycare to work at the preschool because she believed in owners Chris and Balanga Madison's vision to create a Black-owned school for underprivileged children. She said she loved the kids and the other staff members, but she thinks it all fell apart when the school couldn’t make payroll back in August. Education WPTV learns this school's teachers are working without pay Ethan Stein “I’m very in financial debt,” King said. “I had to try to borrow money, try do something so I can borrow rent, try to pay bills and everything. I personally feel like they owe me more… now that they put me in a financial struggle.”King said she had to borrow money from family and friends to make ends meet. She said she can’t afford a lawyer and since Florida dissolved its Department of Labor in 2002, she now has to file a complaint with the United States Department of Labor. King said she’s struggling to get a response or anybody on the phone during the government shutdown.“You can’t even call anyone,” she said. “I call the line. They hang up on me. It’s just very frustrating.”King said she’s also frustrated she didn’t get paid after spending money to decorate her classroom.The school, according to Step Up for Students, received about $44,000 from taxpayer-funded scholarships from students attending the K-12 school. WPTV reached out to the St. Lucie County Early Learning Coalition about funds the preschool received and didn’t hear back by publication. Education Teachers report no background checks at this Fort Pierce school Ethan Stein Multiple teachers also told WPTV earlier this month that they didn’t receive legally required background checks before they started working at Creative Learning Lab Academy. However, King said she did receive a background check. State law requires teachers and any other school employee to get a level two background investigation. Those investigations include sending fingerprints to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which did tell WPTV it had some prints on file for the Fort Pierce private school. However, multiple employees told WPTV they didn’t receive any background checks before entering the school even though offer letters said a successful “background screening” was required for employment.The Florida Department of Children and Families said it is still working to get our news team information about any possible investigation or regulatory action against the school’s owners for more than a month.

Although some officers voiced support for the police chief, a majority of officers said she created a \"hostile\" work environment. Fort Pierce Police Department Acting Deputy Chief Caleb Gillette Rick Reed, who owns a diner in town, said he believes the former chief's leadership led to a divide in management.\"She didn't have experience,\" Reed told WPTV on Monday. \"The police department was very dysfunctional, and it was reflected in her inability to serve our community.\"A spokesperson for the city of Fort Pierce told WPTV the city will spend about $25,000 on a search firm to hire the next police chief.

Rob Van Winkle — best known as Vanilla Ice — is transforming the historic Masonic Lodge behind City Hall into a one-of-a-kind brewery and pop-culture museum.WATCH BELOW: Vanilla Ice Brewery nears completion in Lake Worth Beach Vanilla Ice Brewery nears completion in Lake Worth Beach Commissioner Anthony Segrich said the project is exactly the kind of investment the city's Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) has been hoping to attract.\"We expect to get some good tourism traffic, bring in some traffic from the other cities, as well as kind of extend our downtown past Dixie Highway,\" Segrich said.The century-old building had sat empty for years, deteriorating.Segrich said the city is thrilled to see an investor take on its revitalization — calling it a major win for redevelopment.While Segrich didn't have exact figures for the project's potential economic impact, he believes it will serve as a strong anchor for the area, one that can draw visitors, jobs and long-term stability.\"They are doing things the right way, getting all their necessary permits, all the licensing, working with the city at every step,\" Segrich said. \"Now, that is a longer process.\"That process — the permits and approvals — was the main reason the project stalled after its initial 2022 announcement. But now, Van Winkle says the brewery has the official green light.\"We will be open in 2026,\" he said. \"As you can see, we're making a lot of progress here.\"The future Vanilla Ice Brewery, located at 1000 Lake Ave., will include much more than just beer on tap. Plans call for a rooftop bar, outdoor venue, speakeasy and a pop-culture museum featuring memorabilia from Van Winkle's decades-long career.\"This is much more than just a brewery,\" Van Winkle said.When asked if a project of this size could take away business from nearby restaurants and bars, the \"Ice, Ice, Baby\" singer said it will have the opposite effect.\"This is going to help everybody — are you kidding me? You need traffic here. There isn't any,\" Van Winkle said.He said once open, the brewery will create more than 50 jobs in Lake Worth Beach and help attract tourists from across South Florida.\"Honestly, if I would've known that it was going to be this difficult, I would've never done it,\" Van Winkle admitted. \"But I promise you this, we'll get there.
