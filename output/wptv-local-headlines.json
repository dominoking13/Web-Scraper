    "content": "NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyDelray Beach Delray Beach parking pilot program draws criticism over meters and rate increases Employees and residents say the new program is taking time to get used to WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Delray Beach’s new paid parking rates and time limits in the downtown core continue to frustrate residents, visitors, and business owners, who say the rollout has been confusing and inconsistent. The changes, part of a pilot program that began Oct. 1, raised prices in garages and surface lots and introduced new limits on how long drivers can stay. WATCH: Frustrations mount over paid parking pilot program Delray Beach parking pilot program draws criticism over meters and rate increases For visitor John Durr, simply paying to park became its own challenge. “It’s confusing, I don’t want to say it could be easier, but it’s not so easy for me right now,” he said after struggling with a meter. Earlier, he tried to use a kiosk that displayed an error message. “The machine here is out of paper over here, I couldn’t get it to work,\" he said. Inside Silverball Retro Arcade, general manager Vincent Messera said his customers have been voicing similar frustrations. Employees who work downtown can pay $10 a month for parking permits, but he says that is not sitting well with staff. “It’s taking some time for employees and guests to get used to—they’re so used to free parking for how many years. I think awareness needs to increase so people know and they don’t get ticketed,” he said. WPTV A sign inside Silverball Retro Arcade in downtown Delray Beach. Longtime Delray Beach resident Rick Reeder criticized the city for what he sees as poor maintenance of the meters and a lack of preparation. “The cost of the parking is reasonable but when they give you a machine that begins the conversation with you by telling you the printer has no paper so you can’t get a receipt—that is miserable management of the parking facility system.” The city’s Public Works Department oversees the meters and upkeep. The issue of increased rates and public frustration was raised at a recent commission meeting, but city leaders agreed to keep the new structure in place until the pilot program ends in April. Delray Beach Parking price hike has local businesses worried about community impact Vannia Joseph In October, Mayor Tom Carney told WPTV reporter Joel Lopez, the city will be evaluating usage data before making any long-term decisions. “The city needs the revenues, the residents need to make sure their assets are being monetized properly,” he said. For those who rely on downtown parking, the hope is that the system becomes easier to navigate in the meantime. As Reeder put it, “If we’re gonna have these laws to collect these parking fees—which are reasonable, I don’t have a problem with that—then manage your system to facilitate it being done in a manner that’s professional and reflects well on the city.”",

    "content": "NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates Citizens Insurance judges funded by insurer they rule on, court records show WPTV Investigative Reporter Kate Hussey is digging into records that show the insurer is funding the salaries of judges who decide policyholder disputes, raising constitutional concerns about fairness Kate Hussey, WPTV Records show the judges presiding over Citizens' arbitration cases are funded by the insurer By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated VERO BEACH, Fla. — Florida homeowners forced into arbitration with Citizens Insurance face judges whose salaries are funded by the very company they're ruling against, court records obtained by WPTV reveal.WATCH BELOW: 'What are we going to do,' Glorida and Jason Nitch tell WPTV''s Kate Hussey Citizens Insurance judges funded by insurer they rule on, court records show In 2023, the state-run insurer added mandatory arbitration clauses to policies, forcing policyholders into a process where administrative law judges — not juries — decide claim disputes. A contract between Citizens and the state's Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) shows the insurer funds these judges' salaries at about $250,000 per year, set to increase to $266,000 next year. The Florida Legislature approved the agreement in House Bill 799. \"I don't think it's constitutional at all,\" said insurance attorney Aaron Bass, who has no cases with Citizens but was shocked to learn of the arrangement. \"Judges take an oath to uphold the law, to follow the law and to be impartial, but judges are human. I don't see how they can divorce their humanity from the fact that most of these administrative law judges need to pay their mortgage, pay for groceries.\"According to a Citizens Board of Governors meeting, more than 1,000 claim disputes had been sent to DOAH over the past two years. About half of those, 517, were fully resolved. Data from Citizens shows 37% of those cases ended in \"favorable settlements\" for the policyholder. Just 11% went to a final hearing. WPTV read through a full year of final hearing cases from May 2024 to May 2025 and found that of the 54 cases that weren't settled and went to a final hearing — with both sides presenting evidence — judges sided with Citizens in 53 out of 54 of them — 99%. \"You would think it would be 50-50, but it isn't,\" Bass said. \"It is almost an existentially disproportionate number of losses for homeowners versus wins for homeowners. Just absolutely crazy.\" Kate Hussey, WPTV News The State-wide insurer added a mandatory arbitration clause into their policies in 2023, forcing homeowners to go to arbitration before hitting the courtroom. In one motion to vacate WPTV reviewed, a Pembroke Pines couple who sustained damage from Hurricane Milton claimed the administrative law judge presiding over their case restricted their ability to present testimony and evidence, depriving them of a full and fair hearing. Additionally, an analysis by nonprofit ProPublica found DOAH judges issued similar rulings in at least 20 other fact finding phases of disputes. Citizens is Florida’s state-run insurer — a last resort for many homeowners who can’t find coverage elsewhere.The company now holds the third-largest number of policies in the state, down from its 2023 peak, when it held 15% of the market and ranked number one. Homeowners caught in limbo Glorida and Jason Nitch of Vero Beach have been waiting more than a year for a final decision on their insurance claim after an EF-3 tornado damaged their home ahead of Hurricane Milton. Their roof has been leaking ever since, with the ceiling separating and creating gaps along the walls.Citizens denied their claim in a May 15 letter, blaming \"wear, tear, and age-related deterioration.\" But a private engineer's report the couple paid for found the tornado caused more than $65,000 in damage.WATCH BELOW: Florida OIG subpoenas firm over Citizens Insurance allegations Florida OIG subpoenas Palm Beach Gardens firm over Citizens Insurance allegations \"We gotta fix this! Or it's going to crumble down around us and we're not going to have anywhere to go,\" Glorida Nitch said.The couple hired attorney Meredith Truen with HL Law Group, but their case went straight to arbitration — a process they had no say in choosing.\"I didn't know that until you told me,\" Glorida Nitch said, when learning Citizens funds the judges. \"I think it's extremely unfair.\"\"Did you have any idea this clause was in your policy?\" reporter Kate Hussey asked the couple.\"No, no!\" they responded. Constitutional challenges emerge The arbitration process is now facing legal challenges. In August, a circuit court judge issued a statewide injunction halting all Citizens arbitrations, siding with a Hillsborough County lawsuit that argued policyholders don't have a choice in the matter.Attorney Joey Padilla, who is suing Citizens on behalf of his Delray Beach clients, denied coverage for damage last October, said the process strips away fundamental rights.\"I think they're stripping the Citizens insurance policy holders of their rights,\" Padilla said. \"They have a right to a trial by a jury, and this is forcing their hand.\"Nearly 400 Citizens cases are now on hold while courts question the arbitration clause's constitutionality. Citizens defends the process Citizens defends its arbitration system, saying it saves time and money, while cutting down on frivolous lawsuits. The insurer's data shows arbitration costs average about $7,600 compared to more than $20,000 in state court, with resolution times of 85 days versus 622 days in court.A Citizens spokesperson said policyholders \"impacted by the new arbitration clause\" were \"notified of those changes before renewal\" and noted Florida law \"prohibits any adverse employment action\" based on a judge's decision.The insurer also noted that while one judge is questioning its constitutionality, many other judges have previously ruled Citizens' arbitration process is legal and should continue. WATCH BELOW: Citizens Insurance rate of paying claims questioned Citizens Insurance rate of claim denial questioned Citizens CEO Tim Cerio said in a press release that 90% of claims sent to the Division of Administrative Hearings since 2024 were settled voluntarily.However, court documents suggest policyholders may feel pressured to settle. In cases where homeowners lose, Citizens can demand reimbursement of attorney fees and costs that could reach $10,000 to $20,000, Bass said.Of the cases that were resolved, Citizens data shows more than half of policyholders settled with \"nominal or no payment.\" \"Usually with Citizens, it's $500,\" Bass said. \"We'll pay you $500, you have 30 days to accept this. If you do not accept it in 30 days, and we go to trial and we will prevail.\" Waiting for resolution For the Nitchs, the legal limbo means continued financial strain. Jason is on disability with a fixed income, and they can't afford out-of-pocket repairs.\"What are we going to do?\" Glorida Nitch asked. \"I'm on disability. I'm on a very fixed income.\"Their attorney, Truen, said the case is \"stalled indefinitely.\"\"Unless they have lots of money stored away to go ahead and make those repairs, they're in the waiting game,\" Truen said.Citizens tells me their claims team is taking another look at the Nitchs' case. But for now, the couple continues waiting as their home deteriorates around them.\"We can't do it out of pocket,\" Glorida Nitch said. \"And we can't win. How are you supposed to win?

WATCH: An additional 12 arrests are expected Attorney general announces child sex crime arrests in Martin County Other arrests include Igor Ravinsky, a Russian national, accused of sexual battery on a 14-year-old girl, and Egyptian national Mohamed Kamal-Mostafa Mesregah, for trying to meet an underage girl to engage in sexual acts. \"These cases highlight that there are individuals from around the world who are willing to travel to little Martin County to take advantage of the youth,\" Martin County Sheriff John Budensiek said. The operation, called “Operation All Tricks, No Treats,” was a three-day online investigation conducted in October. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office said eight undercover officers from local, state and federal agencies posed as underage children online to identify potential predators.“Eighteen individuals took the bait. Eighteen individuals interacted with our detectives, half of which sent sexually explicit photos of them doing inappropriate things to our 14-year-old undercovers and tried to engage in some kind of sexual activity,” said Budensiek. Six people were arrested and are being held at the Martin County Jail for allegedly traveling to meet minors for sex. Authorities said an additional 12 arrests are in the works.“They are prolific. You need to understand that,” said Thomas Bakkedahl, state attorney for the 19th Judicial Circuit. “This is a message that I’m sending not to families, but I’m sending to them — that we’re watching.”WATCH FULL PRESS CONFERENCE BELOW: Attorney General Uthmeier announces string of child sex crime arrests in Martin County Body camera footage released by the sheriff’s office shows several of those arrests as suspects arrived at agreed meeting spots.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who was in Stuart on Wednesday to discuss the operation, said the cases send a clear message to would-be predators.“These individuals, they thought they could hide behind a screen and get away with it. They were wrong,” Uthmeier said. “If you are a child predator here in Florida, we’re coming after you like never before.”Budensiek said in the age of social media, cases like these are becoming increasingly common. It’s why law enforcement officials are urging parents to monitor their children. “Parents, please be involved, ask questions, look at the devices, and then partner up with law enforcement, so we can jump on these cases quickly,” said Stuart Police Chief Flamur Zenelovic.The sheriff's office said the following suspects face charges in the operation:Isaias Chaman Coy, 40, Guatemala, who the sheriff's office said was in the country illegallyCharges: Use of a computer to seduce, solicit, lure or entice a child; travel to meet after using a computer to lure a child.ICE detainer placedDavid Desormeaux, 39, CanadaCharges: Use of a computer to seduce, solicit, lure or entice a child; travel to meet after using a computer to lure a child; use of a two-way communication device to facilitate a felony.

    "content": "NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyPort St Lucie Police: Dispute between suspect, victim dates over a year before Port St. Lucie double homicide One victim attempted to get an injunction of protection against the suspect, which the court denied Port St. Lucie Police Department By: Samantha Roesler , Tyler Hatfield Posted and last updated PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Port St. Lucie Police Chief Leo Niemczyk provided more details Thursday morning on what led to the double homicide in the Tropical East community earlier this week. Police say Mark Douglas Golden, 54, and David Walter Gasik, 75, were shot during a neighbor dispute by Paul Maraio, 62, who then turned the gun on himself and died from his injuries.WATCH: Police chief says motive tied to civil dispute with HOA board Dispute between Port St. Lucie gunman, victim dates back over a year before double homicide Maraio also held a neighbor, identified as 77-year-old Suzanne Rothermel, hostage for almost three hours after killing the two men. Chief Niemczyk said the motive appears tied to a civil dispute with the Tropical East HOA board, where Golden served as treasurer and Gasik’s wife was the secretary. However, Niemczyk added that tensions originally stemmed from clashing political beliefs. \"The two are on opposite ends of the spectrum, so their views conflicted, so they were not fond of each other out of the gate early in the relationship, and I think that the HOA issue just further exasperated the situation,\" Niemczyk said. According to police, the HOA served Maraio an eviction notice on Oct. 21. \"They had deemed him to be a disruptive resident and somebody that made other people uncomfortable,\" Niemczyk said. WATCH THE FULL PRESS CONFERENCE BELOW: Port St. Lucie Chief Leo Niemczyk gives update on double homicide Police had responded to three prior complaints involving Maraio before the shooting.The first was on June 13, 2024, when Golden requested that Maraio to be trespassed from his home. The trespass was valid for six months. \"The second incident was on March 12 of 2025, between the suspect and the victim (Golden), regarding harassing, antagonizing comments,\" Niemczyk said. \"And during that incident, allegedly, the suspect had made a gesture of allegedly slashing the throat.\"Maraio was then issued another trespassing. The most recent incident before the shooting was on Sept. 22, when Golden alleged that Maraio was using binoculars from the back of his home to view the victim and his partner inside their home. At this time, the second trespass was still in order. \"(Maraio) was known to be law enforcement friendly, liked dealing with law enforcement, and he always had a quick answer, always had an explanation for the behavior, and just nothing ever brought him to the point where he was considered an imminent threat to anybody,\" Niemczyk said. \"Although I would think that (Golden) would certainly say that he felt that he was in fear enough so that he asked for him to be trespassed from his home.\" Niemczyk said that Golden then attempted to get an injunction of protection against Maraio, which the court denied.Lieutenant Daniel Herrington said that neighbors saw Maraio walking down in the neighborhood on the way to Golden's house the day of the shooting. \"(Maraio) walked right up to Mr. Golden's residence and shot him,\" Niemczyk said. \"The one employee who was working on a neighboring house said he turned around and sees our suspect leaving with a handgun in his hand, just walking away, he then went to our second victim's home, Mr. Gasik and shocked him, and then proceeded to go across the street to our third victim's home, where he entered her home and then eventually took her as a hostage.\"WATCH: WPTV speaks with neighbor held hostage WPTV speaks with woman held hostage by neighbor in Port St. Lucie Police say Maraio shot Golden twice in the back inside his garage and Gasik once in the abdomen through a screen door with a semiautomatic pistol. Afterward, he entered Rothermel’s home through her garage, telling her that “something bad had happened outside.” She initially believed he was fleeing from an incident, but later realized he was responsible.Niemczyk said the department is working to determine if there was something they could have done to prevent this deadly incident. \"There's just no way for us to have known,\" Niemczyk said. \"We don't have a crystal ball. We deal with neighbor disputes all the time. We deal with people who are a little odd all the time. We deal with people who are under stress all the time. And it's very difficult to know what people are truly capable of.\" Police are still looking into how Maraio obtained the pistol used to kill the two men.",
