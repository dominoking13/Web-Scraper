The occasion, filled with song, prayer, and tears, signaled the first major turning point in a peace agreement two years in the making.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: ‘It’s a great day to be Jewish’: Jupiter family celebrates release of hostages in Israel For Warren Rochmaker, the moment was deeply personal. His two children, Talia and David, were in school in Israel when the attacks happened on October 7, 2023. With flights grounded, they were trapped for days, unable to return home.“It wasn’t until that moment that [the hostages] were first on TV… that’s when you knew everything was going to be okay,” said Rochmaker.Though his children were not taken hostage, the fear and trauma of those uncertain days left a lasting mark. Once they returned home, the gravity of what happened began to surface.“The horrors of everything started coming out then,” said Rockmacher. “What had happened on October 7.”Now, nearly two years later, Rochmaker says the release of the final hostages feels like a turning point.“It’s a great day,” said Rochmaker. “It’s a great day to be Jewish,” he said. “It really is. It’s a very prideful day and especially falling on this holiday the way it is — it’s pretty amazing.”The holiday he’s referring to is Simchat Torah, which marks the completion of the annual Torah reading cycle and the start of a new one. Coincidentally, the original attacks in 2023 also fell on Simchat Torah, giving today’s release a profound, symbolic meaning for many.“You could see it that way, as divine intervention,” said Rochmaker.He also credited former President Donald Trump, saying, “This would not have happened without him.”Still, amid the joy, he remains clear-eyed about what comes next.“We’ve got to keep what happened alive,” said Rochmaker. “We have to remember.

Police said it’s a part of Boca Raton School Zone Safety Program. Speeding drivers will be automatically issued $100 fine if driving 10mph above school zone limits. WPTV’s Zitlali Solache spoke with students and parents from J.C.

WPTV Lee Walker and his son, Wesley, expressed their concerns on speeding drivers. Police said since the warning period began on Sept. 2, more than 1,300 warnings were given, with over half coming from J.C. Mitchell Elementary. They say the fines won’t add points or impact insurance.“I guess my concern is mainly someone just getting hit you know,” said nearby resident Don Thompson. It’s been plenty of close calls.”Thompson is now pushing for change in hopes it will slow drivers down. He adds he has a 2-year-old son plays outside in the neighborhood. “Hopefully we can get a speed bump on this street because this is the main game,” said Thompson. “This is like NASCAR down the street. It gets pretty bad.” WPTV Thompson said he's urging the city to add speed bumps or a roundabout in his neighborhood. The enforcement comes from House Bill 657. Under the law, the use of cameras is authorized to enforce speeding violations throughout the school day. “I hope that people start to realize that there’s repercussions for the way that they drive,” said Lee. ; }).then();",

In 2018, Anixa Biosciences CEO Dr. Amit Kumar learned of their research and partnered with Cleveland Clinic to move the vaccine from lab testing toward FDA approval for human trials.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's Meghan McRoberts' speaks Anixa Biosciences CEO Dr. Amit Kumar Promising breast cancer vaccine could be available by 2030, researchers say Kumar said the FDA approved testing in women in late 2021, leading to the start of the first trial phase in 2022. Since then, 35 women—including one from Florida—have participated.“The data is looking incredibly promising,” Kumar said. “In fact, the data that we have seen is more promising than any other cancer vaccine data that has ever been tried before. That’s one of the reasons we’re very excited.\"Phase 1 focused on safety and early effectiveness. “We found it to be perfectly safe, with no side effects. The only side effect women saw was irritation at the injection site,” said Kumar.Participants were divided into three groups:-Women who had triple-negative breast cancer and feared recurrence. “We chose those women because we wanted to test safety on women who had already gone through breast cancer,” said Dr. Kumar.-Women carrying the BRCA gene mutation who had not been diagnosed but were at high risk. They received the vaccine before voluntary mastectomies. \"After they have their mastectomy, then we have a chance to get a look at their purportedly healthy tissue. But what we think we’re going to find is that the vaccine has induced their immune systems to surveil the tissue to look for micro tumors that we believe might exist in these women,” said Kumar.-Women who had undergone treatment for triple-negative breast cancer but still had residual disease. “We’re trying to develop a vaccine that kills the cancer cells themselves,” Kumar said.According to Kumar, all participants showed a positive immune response—75% with a “good” response and the rest with a “moderate” one.Phase 2 will involve a larger, more diverse group of newly diagnosed patients to further evaluate effectiveness. Half will receive the vaccine and half a placebo. “We want to be able to show the vaccine trains the immune system to try to reduce the cancer tumor, the size of the tumor, the number of cells, and the strength of the tumor,” Kumar said.Phase 2 is expected to begin early next year and last two to three years, followed by Phase 3. Kumar hopes continued success will bring researchers closer to making breast cancer “a diagnosis of the past.”“The holy grail is to prevent breast cancer… and maybe do to breast cancer what we’ve done to polio and smallpox,” Kumar said. “We’re not trying to treat or cure a small number of women. We’re trying to eliminate this as a disease.”WPTV’s Meghan McRoberts asked if this research could lead to vaccines for other cancers. “Yes,” Kumar said. “We already have another program with Cleveland Clinic on ovarian cancer and that is being funded by the National Cancer Institute. And then we’ve just initiated programs in lung, colon, and prostate cancer. Based on the success we’ve seen in the breast cancer situation in human women, we feel this approach could be used for multiple other types of cancer.” ; }).then();",

The ongoing civil rights lawsuit against the state of Florida and federal government alleges that First Amendment rights of immigration attorneys and their clients are being violated because they cannot meet in a timely and confidential manner.Attorneys, like Anna Weiser, have previously pointed to a detrimental three-day waiting period between requesting a client visit and receiving one.\"There's a very detailed form, unlike at some you know, most other facilities, that needs to be filled out, they also have to review every legal document that we intend to bring into the visitation room,\" Weiser told WPTV in August. \"As soon as that visit has been confirmed and scheduled... in about a couple of days, the client gets moved out.\"A 66-page declaration from Mark Saunders, vice president of The Nakamoto Group, Inc., the private company that helps operate Alligator Alcatraz, seeks to discredit those complaints. Saunders claims many complaints come from \"prior versions of the visitation and mail policy (that) incorrectly represented that attorneys must submit the documents required to schedule a visit at least three business days before a visit is scheduled.\"Saunders included a copy of the current policy, which he says contains the correct language.Nicolas Aguado, an immigration attorney who has had clients in Alligator Alcatraz, acknowledged some improvements have been made since the facility opened over the summer.\"I do believe that every single day is an opportunity to get better,\" Aguado said. \"Yes. It has improved. It has improved. Anybody saying otherwise, I believe would you know, not be to the truth. The problem is, is that enough?\"Emails from Aguado's law firm were included in Saunders' declaration as evidence that attorney-client visits are being arranged without a three-day waiting period. However, the emails from early September still show the facility asking Aguado's assistant to fill out a visitation request form.Saunders said the request form was part of language included in the previous visitation policy as a mistake, along with the direction to \"attach copies of legal documents you tend to bring for approval. All items are subject to inspection and must be pre-approved.\"\"I think excuses are excuses,\" Aguado said. \"We need to really get on and properly, start getting this to work properly.\"As far as Aguado is concerned, things still are not working properly.\"They do hinder the due process and the ability to render legal advice to our clients, and it does affect the fact that there are many clients that I simply now won't take, because I can't effectively represent them in that Alligator Alcatraz situation,\" Aguado said.Regarding allegations that clients were deliberately getting moved out of Alligator Alcatraz before their scheduled meetings, Saunders wrote that transfers are at the sole discretion of federal authorities, which do not operate the facility.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

Together, they're turning underused public land into 41 affordable homes: 22 townhomes for low-income buyers and 19 single-family homes for moderate-income families.Vice Mayor Woodrow Hay said the goal is simple — to give workers a chance to live where they work.\"You work in Boynton, you ought to be able to live in Boynton,\" Hay said.Each single-family home is part of Palm Beach County's Workforce Housing Program, which helps ensure long-term affordability. The homes are priced around $301,000, with a required deposit of just over $10,000. They range from 1,400 to 1,800 square feet, featuring three bedrooms and two-car garages.\"This property has been sitting vacant for a long time,\" Hay added. \"Now it's turning into opportunity.\"The registration for a homebuyer lottery to purchase one of the Cottage District homes opens Monday, Oct. 13, and runs through Oct. 17. To qualify, applicants must have:A valid Workforce Housing Certificate from Palm Beach CountyA lender pre-approval letterProof of down payment fundsA lottery for the townhomes will open at a later dateThe BBCRA said the project is part of a broader strategy to revitalize the Heart of Boynton — an area rich in history and culture — while ensuring residents aren't priced out of their own community.Since launching its affordable housing initiative, Boynton Beach has invested more than $13.5 million in completed projects, adding 37 affordable for-sale homes and 247 low-income rental apartments. Another $17.9 million in housing projects are currently underway, with more planned in the years ahead.\"There's a line so long — you can't imagine the amount of people trying to qualify for these homes,\" Hay said. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg.\"City officials said the Cottage District reflects Boynton Beach's vision to create a model neighborhood — one that preserves community character while providing pathways to homeownership for the people who make the city thrive.For more information on the housing development visit: https://www.liveatcottagedistrict.com/community/ ; }).then(); HOUSING RESOURCESCounty-by-county resources for renters facing evictionOUR Florida - Emergency Rental Assistance Relief ProgramPalm Beach County Department of Housing and Economic DevelopmentPalm Beach County Community ServicesBoca RatonSt. Lucie CountyMartin CountyIndian River CountySEEKING SOLUTIONS'Priced Out of Paradise' town hall'Coverage Collapse' town hall'Coverage Collapse' special - March 11, 2024'Coverage Collapse' special, WPTV asks CEOs tough questions - June 27, 2024WPTV hosts live town hall in Port St. Lucie on Florida's insurance crisis - Sept. 17, 2024",

Local Jewish community celebrates historic hostage release deal The emotional day marks the end of a two-year ordeal for families whose loved ones were taken hostage and held in Gaza. Under President Trump's ceasefire agreement, 20 hostages have been freed in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. \"We are thrilled beyond words,\" said Rabbi Jack Moline of B'nai Torah Congregation.Community traditions come to an endRabbi Moline said his congregation had been lighting a second set of candles for the hostages who were being held in darkness, a tradition that is no longer needed now that the hostages have been released. “When we have services here, when we light candles to initiate Shabbat, we've been lighting a second set of candles for the hostages who were being held in darkness. We are just thrilled that we no longer have to observe those two rituals,\" Moline said.The synagogue had also kept chairs in the back representing the remaining hostages, which will be removed during their next worship service.Leaders praise deal beyond politicsBoth Alterman and Moline said the deal transcends political divisions, with credit due to those who made it possible.\"There needs to be a credit given where it's due. It's the Trump administration that was able to bring it to the finish line. \" Alterman said.

The Al-Awda Palestine Right to Return Coalition in Broward County posted a statement online expressing concerns about the agreement.\"It is clear to us that Trump and Netanyahu are engaged in tactics intended to normalize colonialism and dispossession aimed at undermining the near-complete global isolation of Israel, to recover strategic grounds,\" the group said. They added: “The genocide continues because it is armed, funded, and shielded — indeed, directed — by the United States and its imperialist allies.\"To read the group's full statement click here.Looking ahead with hope and remembranceDespite the celebration, community leaders acknowledge there is still work to be done and lives lost to remember.\"Let this not be taken away from us. There is so much more to be done moving forward, but today we celebrate,\" Alterman said.Especially as not all of those killed while under Hamas’ control have been returned to Israel, an agreement in Trump’s deal. \"We're still, of course, saddened by the loss of life, and particularly by the remains that have yet to be returned to Israel,\" Moline said. “We don't know what the future holds for them and for those families that will not be able to have a closure and have a proper Jewish burial process.

The number represents about a third of budgeted positions for sworn officers.WATCH: City says it will cover medical costs for officers West Palm Beach to cover medical costs for police officers sickened by mold According to records obtained from a public records request, around 41 different areas of the West Palm Beach Police Headquarters building need mold or malodor remediation. The mold was found throughout all three floors and the building's basement, as well as multiple senior command staff offices and hallways across the building. A survey conducted by the Fraternal Order of Police for West Palm Beach found the most common symptoms officers reported are respiratory and pulmonary issues like chronic cough, sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, chest tightness and asthma-like symptoms. The survey also found other main symptoms included cognitive complaints, skin issues and other general health complaints like fatigue. Some officers reported serious health conditions due to mold in the police station like strokes, autoimmune conditions, hypertension, blood disease and cardiovascular problems. West Palm Beach Report: Mold or foul odors found in 41 areas of West Palm Beach police station Ethan Stein West Palm Beach’s chief human resources officer, according to an email WPTV obtained, shows the city will offer medical evaluations and possible treatments.“…we will continue to provide any impacted employee appropriate medical evaluation and any necessary treatment at their request,” said Renee Govig, chief human resources officer.The notice comes after union officials complained the city wasn’t responding to the human resources paperwork earlier this month. Then Adam Myers, the police union's president, expressed frustration that the city hadn't initially responded to officers filing injury claim paperwork called \"First Reports of Injury/Exposure.\"\"Despite the volume of reports submitted, employees have yet to receive any known response from the city,\" Myers wrote in a letter dated Oct. 2. \"This lack of acknowledgment or follow-up is unacceptable… These employees deserve immediate medical evaluation, proper treatment, and the assurance that their health and safety are being prioritized by their employer.\"PREVIOUS COVERAGE: More than 100 police officers file injury reports More than 100 West Palm Beach police officers file injury claims related to mold exposure Geoff Bichler, attorney for the police union, said the acknowledgment is essential because it's the first step in getting benefits for work-related injuries.\"What you have here is something that is really unusual in my experience,\" he said. \"Because the reports of injury are made, there's no official acknowledgment of it and nothing has been done.\"Kat Joy, a spokesperson for the city of West Palm Beach, said the building is safe while it spends $6 million to address long-standing maintenance issues, critical upgrades and extending the life of the building. She also told WPTV all officers have the opportunity to seek medical treatment for their injuries.\"Every individual who files a Report of Injury has the option to seek medical treatment, and the city remains committed to ensuring their health and safety throughout this process,\" Joy said. ; }).then();",

The My Safe Florida Home program, managed by the Chief Financial Officer's office, offers grants to help homeowners make storm-related repairs and improvements. Genduso said the income calculation isn't fair since his son doesn't contribute financially to the household and is planning to move out. \"I wrote back to them and said, 'That's not fair. My son is moving. He doesn't contribute financially to the house,'\" Genduso told WPTV.

Investigations cleared Nathaniel of any wrongdoing, but the father says the school and Palm Beach County School District failed to handle the matter appropriately, leaving his family shaken and searching for answers.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Father demands answers after 9-year-old questioned over threatening school note “When my son requested for me to be notified, or for his parent to be notified, two times at least they denied that request,” said Yunior Dopico.With tears in his eyes, Yunior says the Palm Beach County School District and Panther Run Elementary failed his son.“Many things have been violated, and I think that justice should be done,” he added.Nathaniel, a fourth grader at the school, says he was questioned for hours over a note he didn't write. “The principal kept telling me, I kept telling her that it wasn’t me. And the principal kept telling me be honest with me because I have cameras,” he said.Nathaniel says he was then questioned by police with his older sister present while his parents were away.“He starts reading me the Miranda rights and asked if I need a lawyer, I said ‘No.’”Yunior says his son admitted to writing the note out of fear. He says their rights were violated.“That’s a clear violation of parental rights.”Nathaniel says the incident left him shaken.
