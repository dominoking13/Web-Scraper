    "content": "NewsPalm Beach County Arden residents oppose massive AI data center proposal near their community WPTV's Caleb Holder By: Michael Hoffman Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A handful of Arden community residents have raised concerns about a proposed massive data center that could transform hundreds of acres next to their quiet neighborhood into millions of square feet of servers and warehouse space.The project, called Project Tango, would convert more than 200 acres into what developers describe as a \"modern hyperscale AI facility\" spanning 1.8 million square feet, along with 1.9 million square feet of warehouse space. The proposed location sits between Southern Boulevard and the 20 Mile Bend, directly adjacent to protected environmental land.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Arden residents oppose massive AI data center proposal near their community Residents fear the development could disrupt their peaceful community with noise pollution while posing environmental risks. The area currently houses families, the new Saddle Brook Elementary School, and maintains close proximity to a National Wildlife Preserve.\"You should not put a data center next to homes AND a school and a natural National Wildlife Preserve,\" Ben Brown said.Brown, along with neighbors Josh Miller and Corey Kanterman, chose to live in Arden specifically for its quiet, nature-surrounded atmosphere. Now they worry that tranquility could disappear.\"Under the cover of darkness and a code name, they decide, we're actually going to modify this into a giant, you know, power sucking data center that will negatively affect us,\" Brown said.The controversy stems from a site originally approved by the county in 2015 for warehouse construction. However, 10 years later, developers are seeking to modify those plans significantly.According to a county staff report, the massive data center operation would require substantial power consumption and large amounts of water for server cooling. The disposal of that water raises additional environmental concerns for the community.The report specifically notes that \"Data Center use has been attributed across the Country to creation of noise\" – a primary concern for residents like Kanterman, who lives just a few thousand feet from the proposed location.\"My child goes to the school. Ben's child goes to the school a couple 1000 feet away. I live a few 1000 feet away from there. There's an equestrian community nearby. There's wildlife that lives here. There's the environmental impacts of what this is going to bring us,\" Kanterman said.Beyond environmental and noise concerns, residents express frustration over the lack of transparency surrounding the project's development.\"We, most of all want transparency. We're not having we're not getting any of it right now,\" Kanterman said.The Arden community hopes to gain clarity about the project during today's planning and zoning meeting, where they expect to receive answers to their mounting questions about Project Tango's potential impact on their neighborhood.",

And they were just not listening and just, you know, [they were in a] 26 to 28 foot boat [with] twin engines.”Ingles said the boaters passed them several times. They later discovered a viral TikTok video that appeared to make fun of the encounter.“What I was appalled with was the situation as it happened, how they handled themselves,” Ingles said.The Sheriff’s Office confirmed the video is part of its ongoing investigation. Ingles said the behavior created dangerous conditions for rowers.“She’s sitting in a skinny shell so one wake for her is this big, big deal,” he said, explaining that a large wake could cause a rowing shell to tip or sink.Falkner described the instability created by the boaters’ wake.“It feels like the floor just got taken out from underneath you any stability that you’ve held by holding the ores in the middle and the ores out to port and starboard just kind of falls away,” she said.Both Ingles and Falkner said they hope the incident encourages greater awareness around boating etiquette and safety.“The parents that own the boat that bought the boat, I think they’ll think twice and maybe we get more than that, maybe we get consequences,” Ingles said.",

It comes as their coach battles an ongoing medical emergency.A few weeks ago, their head coach, Myles Russ, had to step away from the team.WATCH BELOW: 11-0 Keiser chases another championship for sidelined coach Keiser football team united in championship quest despite coach's medical absence \"We play for him, and we play for us always. Knowing that he's fighting just as hard as we are every day, it's just that much more motivation to go out and do our best every single day,\" said Keiser quarterback Shea Spencer.Russ' absence is felt throughout the team, but his squad is playing every snap in his honor.\"It just brings more fire. I feel sorry for the opponent a little bit more; it just brings that type of heat to the table,\" said defensive tackle Tai Lologo. The word culture is what players and coaches use when describing the winning mindset instilled in the team.In fact, that culture has defensive coordinator Peter Davila effortlessly stepping in for Russ.\"It's just another day at the office. Everything I do as the coach is about these players; personal accolades really mean nothing to me. I'm more concerned with the enrichment of the players,\" said Davila.That mindset is what has Keiser in the midst of history.Their next playoff game is against No. 6 Marian University, Indiana, on Dec. 6 at 1 p.m. If they win, they will be in the semifinals.They are seeking their fourth straight trip to the NAIA national championship game, winning the title in 2023.\"That's all we've done all year is focus on ourselves. We never play for the opponent; we play for ourselves. It's not going to be a hard task,\" said Lologo.At 11-0 on the season, the Seahawks are the No. 2 team in the playoffs and are using the sour taste of a 2024 national championship loss to propel them to soar into new heights.\"It's exciting. It's playoff football. A lot of teams aren't playing. It's a blessing to be out here every day to serve the lord with the abilities he's blessed us with,\" Spencer said.The NAIA football national championship game is Dec. 20 in Fort Worth.",

The first happened nearly two weeks ago in Indian River County, when Sgt. Terri Sweeting-Mashkow was shot and killed while serving an eviction notice.WATCH: WPTV tries out shooting simulator Police shooting simulator shows how fast situations turn deadly The second took place Monday night, when Sgt. Erik Levasseur with the Port St. Lucie Police Department was responding to a dispute between neighbors and was shot twice in the face.To try and understand what officers face in the field, WPTV's Kayla McDermott went through a simulator that agencies use for training at Palm Beach State College to get as close to a real scenario as possible. The simulation is very stressful and is supposed to be high stakes, causing some cadets who go through it intense anxiety.\"This job isn't cut out for everybody,\" said Rick Morris, a retired deputy chief who now runs the police academy at the school.The training exercise puts officers in scenarios where they have mere seconds to decide what to do when a suspect refuses to lower their weapon. In one simulation, an officer had to pull the trigger during a scenario where a suspect wouldn't comply. \"Officers don't have a chance to react. They're attacked within seconds,\" Morris said. Palm Beach County Former detective on 4 recent shootings: 'I don't believe they had a choice' Kayla McDermott The simulation offers 400 different scenarios based on real-life situations. \"Hostage situations, domestics, mental health situations,\" said Randy Hoffer, an adjunct professor at PBSC and former police captain who runs the simulator.Trying for herself, McDermott went through a scenario involving a disturbance in a home where a man would not leave. It quickly turned violent with no time for her to react when a man in a wheelchair suddenly drew his gun, shooting everyone in less than a second. \"In that particular case your partner got killed, you got killed, and so did the homeowner. That's how fast that happens,\" Hoffer said. WPTV photographer Jackson Gaylor, after watching McDermott fail the scenario, tried for himself. Even though he knew what was going to happen, he still was unable to save his partner — there was just not enough time.In another situation, when a man was reaching for a gun during a traffic stop, McDermott could not unholster her weapon before a suspect fired. It's something Morris said, \"Happens, it happens a lot,\" as officers have to release a safety strap before they can draw their weapon. In the last scenario, McDermott was hit by an unseen suspect in the tree line when responding to a home invasion. It all happened in a matter of seconds. \"It's very stressful, it becomes very difficult to determine what the situation is going to be,\" Hoffer said. He went on to say the simulator is one of the best ways officers can prepare for what it's like out in the field. \"If somebody's already made a decision that they're going to shoot, they have a distinct advantage over us,\" Hoffer said.When asking Morris what he hopes the general public takes away from seeing this experience, and how little time officers truly have out in the field, he emphasized the complexity they face. \"It's not a police officer going with a gun to shoot somebody. It's a police officer reacting to something that could be fatal to himself or others,\" Morris said. \"Officers aren't going in with the intent to kill people. Once that does happen, it affects them emotionally. For us, their life, it's something that never goes away. No one wants to take a human life, no one.\" This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

I miss the rainbows, but what can you do? This will help.\"A representative from the city of West Palm Beach said the crosswalk was installed by a developer as part of their project requirements.The goal of the red paint is to bring attention to the crosswalk for safety purposes for both pedestrians and drivers.The city said the color is permitted from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and that there are plans to paint additional crosswalks along Flagler Drive to allow for mid-block pedestrian crossings.Meanwhile, questions remain about FDOT's enforcement consistency. In a June memorandum, FDOT issued that non-compliant traffic control markings currently installed are to be \"immediately\" remedied, modified, or replaced.A nearly mile-long road mural along Rosemary Avenue featuring various designs remains intact, despite FDOT's swift and persistent action to remove the Delray Beach mural. “It’s not safe to be honest; I almost got hit crossing the street,” Kerby Dorvil stated about the mural along Rosemary Avenue.He observed how the designs have complicated the lines of traffic, creating confusion for drivers.\"I've noticed cars in the middle of the road going crazy,\" said Dorvil, who said he's seen cars misidentify the music staff painted on the road for traffic lanes and drive on the wrong side of the street.FDOT has not responded to requests for comment about the discrepancy since September.The city said they plan to repave the roadway of Rosemary Avenue, but has not set specific dates for the work.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

WATCH BELOW: West Palm Beach can't afford $100M for new police station amid mold issues West Palm Beach can't afford $100M for new police station amid mold issues City commissioners started discussing the possibility of buying a new police station after Commissioner Christy Fox proposed in November to sell the downtown police station rather than spending more than $6 million to repair and refurbish the building.The city said it's spending the money after WPTV reported in August that a contractor found about 41 different areas of the building needing mold or malodor remediation.Johnson said the city started looking into constructing a new building after being approached multiple times by unnamed individuals about a land swap. But she said the financial commitment would require financing.\"If we were to look at all of the reserves that we have within the city, it would deplete everything that we have in terms of reserves,\" Johnson said. \"It will completely deplete them, wipe them out and then we would have to borrow.\"She also said the city didn't put in a financial plan in the past for a new building, and these current repairs have a 10-year warranty. But, commissioners have become concerned because officers expressed concerns about their safety working in the building while other employees have been moved to other areas.More than 100 West Palm Beach police officers have filed injury claims related to mold exposure, according to an attorney for the police officers' union that WPTV spoke with last month. However, Mayor Keith James has dismissed those concerns as not based on facts or data.\"I think it's important for those who sit in these seats to make decisions upon actual facts and data,\" James said last month. \"Not information propagated from parties with specific agendas. No, the police building is not infested with mold. Are there instances with mold that is being addressed? Absolutely, and we are addressing that. But, everything you hear isn't true and consider the source.\"City officials said the contractors they’ve hired, Belfor and the Mold Inspector, tell them it's still safe for people to work in the building.\"There is no employee that is being forced to work in an area of the building that has had an abnormal air reading,\" said Assistant City Administrator Jose Luis Rodriguez.Police Chief Tony Araujo has reiterated the city's claims about the building being safe, even if people are being moved out of places needing remediation or being sent to other departmental facilities for various activities. He also said the current building has enough space for the department.",

By: Vannia Joseph Posted BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — As the year wraps up, Boynton Beach officials are sharing the first detailed look at how the city's red-light camera program is performing — months after expanding the network and drawing criticism from some residents. Two new cameras at the intersection of Congress Avenue and Miner Road became active in March, bringing the city's total to 18 cameras. Police Chief Joe DeGiulio said more cameras are planned and on hold due to ongoing roadwork.WATCH: City releases data on red-light cameras Boynton Beach releases year-end update on red-light cameras as crash numbers decline \"There's two, three cameras still pending at Seacrest and Woolbright but those are being delayed by a roadway project,\" DeGiulio said.At a recent commission meeting, DeGiulio presented a year-end update showing what he described as encouraging trends.\"We're having decreases in crashes, decreases in serious bodily injury crashes, as well as fatalities — and our notice of violations are roughly remaining the same,\" he told city leaders.When the program expanded earlier this year, some residents voiced opposition, calling the additional cameras excessive or unnecessary. Others argued that drivers following the law shouldn't be concerned.Boynton Beach remains the only city in Palm Beach County with a red-light camera program. Despite criticism and some calling the program a \"money grab,\" police say the data supports its continued use. Traffic volume in the city has grown by roughly 3 million vehicles, according to police. Yet crashes at intersections monitored by red-light cameras have dropped, from 143 last year to 117 this year. The department also says there have been zero fatalities at those intersections.\"And we're maintaining zero fatalities at these intersections,\" DeGiulio said.The majority of drivers who receive violations are not Boynton Beach residents. Police say 69% of violators live outside the city, while 30% live within city limits. A red-light camera violation costs $158, but increases to $264 if left unpaid for more than 60 days. The violation does not appear on driving records or add points to a license.While additional cameras are still pending, the police department says it is now looking to expand its traffic efforts beyond red-light enforcement.\"We are having conversations internally about a speeding and aggressive driving vehicle like we had maybe 15 years ago. I definitely think there's a need for it,\" DeGiulio said.",

WATCH BELOW: 4 bills aim to cut property taxes in Florida Debate over Florida property taxes heats up in Tallahassee Lawmakers contend that cities and counties in Florida have driven up property taxes by as much as $18 billion in the last three years.\"I'm not sure we've seen an $18 billion increase in services,\" state Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart, said. \"In fact, the collections are outpacing inflation as well as outpacing population growth, so I think there are some requirements for better management overall.\"Overdorf is the co-chair of a select House committee that has come up with several bills, four of which just cleared the State Affairs Committee.The bills are as follows: HJR 201 HJR 205 HJR 209HJR 211They range in policy from eliminating non-education taxes for all homesteaded homeowners, homeowners 65 and older and increasing the homestead exemption for homeowners carrying insurance.\"All bills protect school funding, every single one of them, and the second part is law enforcement is also protected,\" Overdorf said.His committee and the state CFO spent the summer talking with counties and cities about their tax revenue and spending.\"Cutting hundreds of millions of dollars and billions of dollars statewide is an incredibly significant impact,\" Bonlarron said. \"I think the one thing we've told a number of people first and foremost, an overwhelming area where we have spent our dollars are public safety.\"Bonlarron said Palm Beach County is already looking at ways to make their budget leaner, but maintaining services after a property tax cut may require raising fees and finding other revenue streams.\"People want to know in this community (that) when they pick up their phone and dial 911, there will be a 911 operator to pick up the phone and quickly.
