City commissioners voted unanimously this week to install the cameras at 21 school locations, including South Olive Elementary.Parents at South Olive tell WPTV it’s a change that’s long overdue.“It’s just the best place to take her,” said Taylor Scott, who visits South Olive Park regularly with her daughter, Daisy. She and her friend Faye say they often notice speeding during their strolls around the neighborhood.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: ‘Benefits are worth the cost’: West Palm Commission votes to install speed cameras in 21 school zones “I mean, people just drive so fast,” Taylor said.“For our children, I think any precaution is good,” Faye added.The new speed enforcement cameras will issue $100 citations to drivers caught going at least 10 miles per hour over the posted school zone limit. The fines will not add points to a driver’s license, similar to how parking tickets are handled.Under state law passed in 2023, the city must provide at least 30 days’ notice before ticketing begins. In some cases, cameras will first issue warnings during a grace period before citations are mailed.Parents like Taylor and Faye say that if the new cameras help make their children’s walks to school safer, the cost is worth it.“There’s nothing I wouldn’t do to keep her safe,” Taylor said.“I think school zones are one thing where the benefits are worth the cost,” Faye added.The cameras are expected to be installed across all 21 West Palm Beach school zones in the coming months:1. Bak Middle2. Bear Lakes Middle3. Belvedere Elementary4. Conniston Middle5. Dreyfoos School of the Arts6. Egret Lakes Elementary7. Ephesus Adventist Academy8. Grassy Waters Elementary9.

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach Former West Palm Beach police officer faced multiple internal investigations before termination Within 9 months on the job, Officer Justice Feeley-Carim was the subject of 2 criminal investigations WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — New records WPTV obtained from a public records request show a former West Palm Beach police officer faced three internal affairs investigations within his first seven months of employment at the city's police department.WATCH BELOW: 'This is the first time I’m hearing about it,' Attorney Ian Goldstein tells WPTV Officer faced multiple internal investigations before termination Those internal investigations appear to have occurred before an incident where a woman claims Justice Feeley-Carim asked a woman to touch him inappropriately over his uniform while on duty in March 2025. The police department announced Feeley-Carim was terminated after his arrest, for false imprisonment and battery, became public in September 2025.According to records found within Feeley-Carim's personnel folder, he was terminated as a probation employee on April 16. The department justified his termination citing three different internal affairs investigations.\"Since March 11, 2025, several complaints have been received in reference to Officer Justice Feeley-Carim #2374,\" reads his termination note. \"The complaints have been captured under IA #25-048, 25-071, and 28-081. Two of the complaints allege serious misconduct and are being criminally investigated. These complaints show a pattern of misconduct.\"WPTV's Ethan Stein obtained a copy of the last internal affairs investigation report, which described an incident where a woman complained about Feeley-Carim illegally searching her car at a Studio Six motel in West Palm Beach. The report found a preponderance of evidence doesn't exist to support that he violated department policy, rules or regulations related to conduct toward the public. However, the report did find a preponderance of evidence does exist to support that Officer Feeley-Carim violated the department's policy related to field reporting related to Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD) reports.WATCH BELOW: West Palm Beach police officer arrested, fired West Palm Beach officer arrested on charges of battery and false imprisonment \"Officer Feeley-Carim failed to properly document the call for service in the form of a CAD report,\" the internal affairs Investigative Summary and Recommended Findings reads. \"...When the call for service was cross-referenced in VisualMCT, nothing to that extent was contained in the notes section. The only information was from a West Palm Beach Police Dispatcher who was updating the call for service and what had happened.\"The report said it recommended a written reprimand for report violation, but he was terminated before the conclusion of the internal affairs investigation. However, WPTV was unable to obtain copies of the other two internal affairs investigations, as the department cited \"active criminal intelligence\" in its response to our public records request.The report for IA25-081 is dated as opened on March 14, 2025. However, the criminal complaint for Officer Feeley-Carim's arrest related to the incident at the Wal-Mart was almost 12 days later on March 26, 2025. The other two internal affairs reports case numbers, IA25-048 and IA25-071, indicate those investigations also happened before the Wal-Mart incident.WATCH BELOW: Department issues statement regarding fired officer Former West Palm Beach police officer arrested months after misconduct complaint The attorney for the victim told WPTV she filed her citizen complaint around April 6, 2025. She told WPTV’s Ethan Stein she didn’t have an internal affairs case number for her clients case at this point.Neither Feeley-Carim nor his attorney, Ian Goldstein, was aware about the internal affairs investigations being cited as the city’s justification for his termination. Goldstein said he didn’t even know Feeley-Carim was involved in three internal affairs investigations.“This is the first time I’m hearing about it,” he said. “It was certainly implied that the reason was that it was his arrest.”A spokesperson for the city of West Palm Beach said it will not comment on open internal affairs investigation. A spokesperson for the state attorney’s office said it’s office had no involvement in internal affairs investigations.Goldstein said the department didn’t need to give a reason for the termination, because Feeley-Carim was in his probation period. He also said Feeley-Carim had fewer procedural rights, because he was a probationary employee.Regardless, Goldstein said his client is not guilty of the crimes alleged in the criminal complaint related to the Wal-Mart situation in March 2025. He said he was surprised the state even filed charges since the states case is solely the witnesses account and nearby surveillance camera.“I mean I was very surprised,” he said. “Particularly, once I got the evidence and I saw there was no evidence that proves anything other than the fact that he was there, which we all knew.”Read more of WPTV's related coverage below: West Palm Beach Police officer arrested on false imprisonment, battery charges Michael Hoffman West Palm Beach Former West Palm Beach police officer arrested months after misconduct complaint Kayla McDermott ; }).then();",

It’s very high in price,' Manager Antonello Bux tells WPTV's Joel Lopez The Breakers to spearhead affordable housing project for temporary staff The 8-story project is called the Breakers Employee Housing Campus.It’s a first-of-its-kind employee-based workforce housing project in the city and the county specifically designed for the hotel’s temporary workers.Paul Leone, the CEO of The Breakers, revealed that they’ve been subsidizing staff housing for over 30 years and felt compelled to do more.The project is located off of Australian Avenue and Palm Beach Lakes, which will house over 200 of their seasonal staff with an affordable place to live.The planning to create an affordable apartment complex is in collaboration between the Breakers, VDG Partners Limited and the city of West Palm Beach. “This is low income, high quality. This is Breakers affordable housing,” said Leone for its temporary employees. “Why? Because employee satisfaction is our number one priority; it’s the key driver to our success.”The project aims to provide housing for seasonal, international, and other temporary workers, featuring 155 units. The units will have private bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and laundry.Beyond living spaces, the project will also include a pool, sports field, and more amenities. The initiative has garnered positive feedback from the community. “You can go anywhere to eat, but The Breakers is all about the service,” said Oliver Copley, who was walking down Worth Avenue on Palm Beach Island. “I think that more companies should do that; most people can’t live in Florida, because of the rent and the expense of living here.”Rents for the new apartments will range from $1,228 for a studio apartment, rising to as high as $3,000 for a two-bedroom unit. This initiative is part of The Breakers’ effort to address the future housing needs of the resort’s temporary workforce and its labor strategy to support staffing needs.Additionally, the project will include a shuttle service for these workers to commute to and from the resort, addressing traffic concerns and parking limitations on Palm Beach.“There’s a problem with parking, especially, so people have to drive here and pay for parking,” said Antonello Bux, the manager of Bice Ristorante on Palm Beach.“They have to pay until 5 o'clock in the afternoon, so if they have to do a split shift, it’s very costly for them. During the season, it gets very busy, so it’s very difficult to find parking space,\" said Bux. \"That is a second nightmare for them; everywhere you come from, you’re also going to find a lot of traffic.” Bux believes The Breakers' project is a great idea, as his restaurant has also felt the strain of the housing cost for their staff.“It’s the same problem for hospitality on all the island,” he noted. “We are an Italian restaurant, so sometimes we hire Italian people, and we need to find a place for them to sleep. There’s nothing affordable. It’s very high in price.”This affordable housing initiative represents a significant commitment from The Breakers to enhance the living conditions for their temporary workforce while contributing to the overall community well-being in West Palm Beach. ; }).then();",

Redding's conservation nonprofit focuses on sea turtle survival.\"So this was the original stake,\" Redding said, pointing to markers used to track nests. \"So we put in an extra stake so we can still tell where it is,\" Redding said.This has been a record-breaking year for sea turtle nesting in Indian River County. As of this week, more than 11,400 Loggerhead, Green and Leatherback nests have been counted.Rough surf has taken chunks out of the beach and brought waves crashing near nests, creating potential problems for the developing eggs located just north of Humiston Park.\"Some washover can cool down a nest, more males hatch. But if there's too much washover, it can drown the eggs,\" Redding said.There is still one more month in sea turtle nesting season, so if you'd like to do your part, keep your distance from adult turtles and hatchlings, and make sure to comply with sea turtle lightning ordinances in your area. ; }).then(); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego WPTV takes a look back at historic tornado outbreak Surfing Blog Pair of storms to bring swell this week James Wieland",

Turcios was one of several students describing the “packed” lunchroom.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's Ange Toussaint sits down with special education teacher Lorraine Olson Lake Worth High School's single lunch period raises safety concerns after pepper spray incident Special education teacher Lorraine Olson believes the single lunch period is to blame for what she feels is an increase in fights at the school, including the Sept. 18 brawl that led to pepper spray being used by a school resource officer. More than 30 people went to the hospital, most for irritation.“I saw it coming and nobody listened to me,” Olson said.In five separate emails sent to the school’s principal days before the fight, Olson warned school and district officials of possible dangers ahead.“I said that there is going to be something catastrophic that is going to happen if we did not stop having only one lunch,” she wrote.In a Sept. 13 email, Olson told school Principal Elena Villani, “There have been multiple fights. Staff is left outside burning in the sun. Students are burning the sun,” the email said.“They deserve to be taught graciousness, pride, and civility. This is not being done,” Olson added.The Palm Beach County School District acknowledged in a statement that there is only one lunch period for all 2,517 Lake Worth High School students.The district said a school resource officer is always on campus at district schools, with multiple officers assigned to high schools.But Olson feels that’s not enough. She said she has been on leave since the incident because she was traumatized.“I can’t imagine how someone can agree to have 2,400 students at lunch with two resource officers, four other behavioral specialists—all wonderful, all do a great job—how they could?

At the same time, the city is launching a new Downtown Employee Parking Permit Pilot Program. For $10 a month, employees and business owners working in the city's Central Business District can park at any city-managed lot in the district or beachside areas — with the exception of Atlantic Avenue and A1A.For employees at Brandy Melville, it's a cost they said is hard to justify.\"I think that there's a good amount of girls here who would reconsider their positions if they knew they had to pay to show up,\" said store manager Arianna Norberto. \"No one should have to pay to park where they work.\" Two of her employees agree, telling WPTV they worry the change could drive workers away from city-managed parking.\"They don't have to add the monthly rates, that's a choice they are choosing to make,\" said employee Alexa Gaumond.\"When I first started working here, one of my primary concerns was having to pay for parking,\" added employee Alara Ataman.Beyond the cost, others worry about convenience.\"And also renewing it every month, that's a little much too,\" said employee Savanah Pienaar.To participate, workers must renew their permits in person each month at the Park Delray office and provide a driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of employment.City Manager Terrance Moore tells WPTV the program is still in its early stages.\"This is merely a pilot program at this point and time,\" Moore said.The city said it will use the six-month trial to evaluate how popular the permits are among both downtown businesses and employees. Officials plan to track the number of permits sold, changes to downtown parking use, and feedback from both groups before making a final decision.\"Given the recommendations offered by previous parking plans of the city of Delray Beach via consultancy and other services, these considerations are not at all unreasonable,\" Moore said.If the program is found to negatively impact businesses or workers, Moore said the City Commission will ultimately decide how to move forward.As for why Atlantic Avenue and A1A were excluded, the city explained those spaces are considered prime parking for visitors to downtown and beachfront businesses and are being reserved for customer convenience.Moore also noted the city has reviewed potential revenue outcomes — estimating anywhere from $500,000 to more than $1 million — but stressed revenue is not the driving factor instead how this pilot plays out for workers and businesses alike and how the city will move forward.The program will run through April 1 as the city collects data and weighs its long-term future. ; }).then();",

By: Freida Frisaro Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — A commercial truck driver accused of making an illegal U-turn that killed three people on Florida's Turnpike last month waived his first appearance hearing Monday and entered a not guilty plea, court records show.Harjinder Singh, a 28-year-old native of India, is being held in the St. Lucie County Jail after being denied bond on three counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. Singh lived in California and was originally issued a commercial driver’s license in Washington before California issued him one. Semi truck driver pleads not guilty in St. Lucie County Fallout from the crash led to a war of words between the Trump administration and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and new, stricter rules for non-citizens to obtain commercial drivers licenses. That policy was announced Friday by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.The Florida Highway Patrol said Singh attempted to make a U-turn Aug. 12 from the northbound lanes of Florida's Turnpike near Fort Pierce. A minivan that was behind Singh's big rig couldn't stop and crashed into the truck, killing its driver and two passengers. Singh and a passenger in the truck were not injured.In a news conference last week, Duffy said an audit conducted after the Florida crash showed the previous rules weren’t strict enough and that a number of states weren’t following them consistently. Driver in fatal Turnpike crash will be extradited back to Florida He said Singh should have never received a commercial license because of his immigration status.That review found that commercial driver’s licenses were improperly issued in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington. But Duffy said the problems were so egregious in California, where Singh's license was issued, that he is threatening to pull $160 million in federal funding.Neither Singh's attorney, Natalie Knight-Tai, nor prosecutor David Dodd responded to emails seeking comment on the case.

She actually looked like (actress) Hedy Lamarr,\" Fisher said, describing her mother with a laugh.WATCH: WPTV gives a voice to survivors of brutal abuse at Florida reform schools Victims of abuse at Florida School for Boys at Okeechobee reckon with state's dark past According to investigators, Jones attempted to rob the Nestors on Dec. 19, 1990, stabbing Dolly and taking her purse before confronting Jack in his office.\"He opened the door, and Mr. Jones stabbed him. So there was quite a fight. My father was a big man, and they fought for about 20 to 25 minutes. That's what I was told,\" Fisher said.During the struggle, according to court documents, Jack Nestor managed to shoot Jones in the forehead.\"They were really good, good people,\" Fisher said. \"Loved each other very much, and had a long life to live. They had at least another 25 years.\"Jones' attorney, Marie-Louise Parmer, acknowledges her client's guilt but argues that crucial mitigating evidence was never presented to the jury that sentenced him to death in the early 1990s.\"He did commit a crime, and two people died, and that's wrong. And no one here is trying to say that's right,\" Parmer said. \"The law is clear that when a jury doesn't get to hear relevant facts that undermine the integrity of the proceedings, then the defendant should have a new trial with an opportunity to present those facts to the jury.”Those facts center around Jones' time at the Florida School for Boys at Okeechobee, where he suffered severe abuse at the hands of state employees.\"He said that he was beaten with the leather strap. He described the same leather strap that numerous other Okeechobee boys have described,\" Parmer said. \"He described what he called 'blanket parties,' which were when older boys in the dorm would target new or younger boys who were confined and gang raped them under a blanket. He also described being placed in solitary confinement.\" WPTV Irene Fisher speaks with WPTV chief investigator Jamie Ostroff about the scheduled execution of Victor Jones, who was convicted of killing her parents in Miami in 1990. The State of Florida didn't officially acknowledge this systematic abuse until 2024, when it passed legislation to compensate survivors of both the Okeechobee school and the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in the Panhandle town of Marianna. Documents provided by Parmer confirm Jones was at Okeechobee in the 1970s and has been deemed eligible for compensation.Maria Deliberato, the executive director of Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, finds Jones' case particularly troubling.\"The state of Florida acknowledges the everlasting trauma that the state inflicted upon these boys and men, and then, at the very same token, with like a just complete lack of understanding empathy, is signing off on the execution of one. And I find that level of cruelty and hypocrisy especially troubling in Victor's case,\" Deliberato said.\"The death penalty is supposed to be for the worst of the worst, the most aggravated, the least mitigated,\" she added.Fisher, who plans to witness the execution with her family, was unaware of Jones' history of institutional abuse until our interview.\"A lot of people had rough childhoods,\" Fisher said. \"A lot of people went through traumatic things as a kid. You just pick yourself up. You've got to do something about it.\"She remains unmoved by Jones' past. \"He had an opportunity. Had he been decent, he would have had a job with my father,\" Fisher said.As the execution date approaches, she is ready for closure. \"I kind of can't wait 'til it's all over with, if you really want to know, and it will be over with soon,\" Fisher said. \"That's another chapter in my life that ends.\"Jones' attorneys have also argued he should be spared execution because he is intellectually disabled, with IQ scores peaking in the 70s. Florida’s courts, including the state Supreme Court, have rejected those arguments and are allowing the execution to proceed as scheduled.Over the weekend, Jones' legal team filed its final appeal with the United States Supreme Court.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

They argue the project would privatize public land and diminish access for residents. Boca Raton 'Save Boca' petition advances after collecting 3,616 verified signatures Ange Toussaint Last week, the Supervisor of Elections verified the Save Boca group has enough signatures to put this issue on the ballot. The city of Boca Raton must also verify the signatures.The mayor says the goal is to have everyone on the same page by the next election.“Ultimately, residents, if this proceeds, will have a vote in March,” Singer said. “They’ll have their say in it. We want to make sure everyone is fully informed.” Boca Raton to begin series of open house events to discuss redevelopment The mayor says the developer made several changes opponents wanted to see, including respecting the city’s height limit and making the project less dense/more green spaces.Jon Pearlman, the founder of Save Boca, is happy with their recent victory in getting this issue on the ballot.“It means that all the hard work and all the communication and the Save Boca movement that swept through the city, we're finally seeing a law that’s gonna come to fruition,” Pearlman said.Pearlman said another victory following petition signatures, is an ordinance limiting the sale or lease of public land. This is set to be reviewed by the city council. Boca Raton More than 5,000 residents rally to block Boca Raton's new development plan Ange Toussaint Boca Raton city staff have published a lot of information and updates about the project on the city’s website. WPTV asked the mayor about this effort to inform people directly from the administration.“I understand people are concerned,” Singer said. “Change is concerning. But I think everyone recognizes that our city hall, community center, and the public spaces we have don’t fit the needs of the community today.”Open house dates: • Monday, Sept. 29, 2025, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Studio at Mizner Park, 201 W. Plaza Real• Monday, Oct. 6, 2025, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the 6500 Building, 6500 Congress AvenueEach session will feature project boards outlining ideas and concepts from the proposal, with team members from Terra & Frisbie Group will be on hand to answer questions.
