LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. — A man charged with killing a woman and their unborn child in St. Lucie County seven years ago was found guilty Friday.It took the jury only about an hour to find Jose Antonio Soto-Escalera of Port St. Lucie guilty of two counts of first-degree murder.\n    \n        Man arrested for murder of pregnant St. Lucie County woman: Sheriff\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n\nIn August 2018, the body of Tania Wise, 23, of Port St. Lucie, was found face down in a ditch off a rural road in northern St. Lucie County.Soto-Escalera, who was 41 years old at the time of the killing, was arrested 28 days after Wise's body was discovered.During the week-long trial, the jury was shown autopsy photos where Wise suffered trauma to her head and throat.Prosecutors contended Soto-Escalera killed Wise so his wife would not find out that he and the victim were involved in a relationship.DNA evidence confirmed Soto-Escalera was the unborn baby's father.The state is also seeking the death penalty in the case. The jury will reconvene on Wednesday for the sentencing phase.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

PETERSBURG, Fla. — A Florida federal judge on Friday tossed out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times.U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that Trump's lawsuit was overly long and was full of \"tedious and burdensome\" language that had no bearing on the legal case.\n    \n        Trump floats revoking licenses for networks critical of him\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\"A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally,\" Merryday wrote in a four-page order. \"This action will begin, will continue, and will end in accord with the rules of procedure and in a professional and dignified manner.\"The judge ruled that Trump has 28 days to file an amended complaint that should not exceed 40 pages in length.The lawsuit named a book and an article written by Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig that focuses on Trump’s finances and his pre-presidency starring role in television's \"The Apprentice.\"Trump said in the lawsuit that they \"maliciously peddled the fact-free narrative\" that television producer Mark Burnett turned Trump into a celebrity — \"even though at and prior to the time of publications defendants knew that President Trump was already a mega-celebrity and an enormous success in business.\"The lawsuit also attacked claims the reporters made about Trump's early business dealings and his father, Fred.Trump also cited an article by Peter Baker last Oct. 20 headlined \"For Trump, a Lifetime of Scandals Heads Toward a Moment of Judgment.\"\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    (Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

His family estimates that during his 41 years as a practicing physician, he helped deliver more than 7,000 babies.\"It wasn't a normal life,\" he said. \"I almost never had a night's sleep uninterrupted. If I did, I woke up thinking there must be something wrong with the phone.\"\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\nBut ask Gerson about his biggest accomplishment, and he won't mention the countless deliveries or medical procedures. Instead, he focuses on something more personal – the relationships he built with thousands of families over the decades.\"What I'm proud of is the great number of people that I had as patients who felt that I had done a good job,\" he said. \"It was something I never dreamt I'd ever feel, but it was a warm feeling. It was like having a giant family in one town.\"\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

The accounts are usually new and often post multiple times on the same date, deputies said,  and victims are asked to send money up front, then pressured with additional “fees” for transport, boarding, or veterinary care.In some cases, they threaten that the animal will be euthanized if the money is not sent.\n    \n    \n\n\n\nThe Martin County Sheriff’s Office advises those interested in buying or adopting an animal to do the following:• Research breeders, shelters, or rescue groups thoroughly before sending money.• Be cautious of new social media pages with little activity or identical posting dates.• Because a pet is such a large investment, always ask to see the animal in person and meet the breeder before making any payments. If the seller refuses or makes excuses, consider it a red flag and do not move forward.• Never send payment through gift cards, wire transfers, or peer-to-peer apps to people you do not know.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc.

According to police, the word “SWAMP” was spray-painted at several locations. Surveillance footage linked Connor Stromoski, 28, as the primary suspect and Samuel Lawson, 28, as a second suspect.Police say that in one incident on April 29, Stromoski and Lawson climbed a rear gate and went to the rooftop of 313 Datura Street at around 11 p.m. to spray graffiti on the building. Stromoski was located by police on Aug. 22 while carrying spray paint, can caps, marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He confessed that \"SWAMP\" was his tag and affirmed being in the surveillance video. Stromoski faces two counts of burglary of an unoccupied structure, three counts of criminal mischief, one count of marijuana possession and one count of possession of drug equipment.Lawson was found on Sept. 6 and is charged with one count of burglary of an unoccupied structure and one count of criminal mischief.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc.

On Dec. 2, 2024, Boca Raton High School was placed in Code Red for two and a half hours after an anonymous phone call stating there was a bomb in the bathroom. The caller, later identified as Bullard, also said he had an AR-15 rifle, threatened to kill someone and would shoot responding police officers. During the investigation, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO) learned that Miami-Dade School Police had experienced two to three false bomb reports that day with similar threats. In April 2025, authorities traced the threats to a residence in Leesburg, Florida. The Leesburg Police Department seized electronic devices from the home and shared the findings with PBSO, linking the case to the December threats. Investigators later identified Bullard as a suspect.Detectives said Bullard, who was 17 at the time, admitted to making the false threats to Boca Raton High and three Miami-Dade schools, none of which he had attended. He told investigators he was on Discord with multiple people coaching him on what to say. Messages from Dec. 2 showed the group planning the calls and later mocking media coverage of the police response.Bullard is scheduled to make his first appearance in Palm Beach County on Friday, and appeared in front of a judge in Miami in July.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc.

Since then, two other professors at the school have also been put on leave for their social media posts in the wake of Kirk’s assassination. WATCH: Dr. Karen Leader speaks to WPTV \n    \n        FAU professor placed on leave over Charlie Kirk posts breaks silence\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n\nDr. Leader, an associate professor of art history, confirmed to Hoffman she was the professor referenced in the university’s announcement. The school said in part, “Our focus remains on our academic community’s responsibility to promote civil discourse, conduct healthy debate, and treat one another with respect.”“I wanted to have a chance to speak to my community and have them see what I'm trying to say,” Leader said. Leader said she has received death threats and had her home and work addresses leaked online. She told Hoffman this was the first time she left her home in nearly a week. “I don't know if I'll go right back home after this and then stay there for another five days,” she said.WATCH: 'That's what so striking to me, the violence'\n    \n        FAU professor Karen Leader on free speech\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n\nLeader showed Hoffman the posts she shared on X that called Kirk “racist, transphobic, homophobic and more.” In those posts, she added the words, “This was Charlie Kirk.”She said she has since deleted a post alleging Kirk used a racial slur after finding it was not true, but left the other posts up, saying she wanted to start a discourse about what she called the “whitewashing of a controversial figure.” “What I did is posted or reposted a lot of content that offered proof that he had said vile things and targeted populations and demonstrated his bigotry, and I was mostly reposting evidence,” Leader said. Hoffman asked how she she responds to people saying the posts were out context.“Yeah. I would say that if you have a preponderance of evidence, one thing taken out of context does not cancel out the preponderance of evidence. The concerted effort to present him as moderate, as uncontroversial, as just wanting to ask questions, just wanting to have conversations. That's not who he was.”WATCH: Dr. Leader says she is open to pursuing lawsuit to defend free speech \n    \n        Professor says she is open to pursuing lawsuit to defend free speech\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n\nBut the discipline from FAU does not appear to fall along partisan lines. Two other professors, Dr. Kate Polak and Dr. Rebel Cole, were also placed on leave for social media posts following Kirk’s assassination. One, Dr. Cole, was placed on leave for conservative leaning posts. Hoffman reached out to both for interviews. Dr. Cole declined, and Dr. Polak has not responded. Leader said she believes all three professors now share some common ground.“Constitutionally, we're on the same side, and so we have a collective responsibility to, you know, force our university to follow the law,” said Leader.

Ferguson cautioned his colleagues on the importance of their public speech and spoke on policy. \"I’m thinking unless you as a parent or you as a teacher feel bad because, I, as a teacher don’t miss a racist, a racist bigot at that, I don’t see how you are going to be at risk of losing your teaching certificate,\" Ferguson remarked.Ferguson's comments went further as he drew alarming comparisons between Kirk and Adolf Hitler.“When we talk about the Holocaust, I have yet to hear a person of the Jewish faith say, ‘I miss Adolf Hitler.’ He said a lot of toxic things that were very undermining to society at large, and we want to never forget that and we want to be better than that. The things that I have heard from this gentleman, Mr. Kirk, as it relates to the Black experience in this country are definitely things that would make me say I am sorry he passed away, but he did not use his voice effectively.” said Ferguson.This commentary quickly sparked controversy among Kirk's supporters.In an interview with WPTV's Joel Lopez, Ferguson was asked whether he was concerned about potential repercussions from his comments.\"I'm not racist. I don't promote racist ideologies or anything like that so based on my understanding on the groundwork, the rules of the road I should say, no I'm not too worried about that,\" Ferguson responded. \"Whatever happens, will happen but my record since I've been on the board has been pretty exceptional and so I'll stand by that at all times. Being a racist is not a protected group of people.\"Ferguson, who has been the District 7 board member for three years and plans to run for reelection, emphasized that while he does not condone Kirk’s assassination, he believes Kirk's remarks about Black people and his opposition to affirmative action, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives merit scrutiny.The West Palm Beach NAACP voiced their support for Ferguson in a statement:\n    \"This is truly a tragedy for all involved; no one deserves to be murdered. We find all murders inexcusable. With that being said, a person's record, deceased or alive, speaks for itself. If you were a racist before you died, why would you be considered anything other than that after death? The means by which you die do not change who you are, what you represent, or the things you did while you lived. All that I know leads me to say Charlie Kirk was a racist.\" - Alfred Fields, West Palm Beach NAACP.\n    \n    \n\nSome have questioned Ferguson’s assertions about Kirk, particularly noting that he admitted he was unaware of Kirk prior to his assassination.When Lopez inquired if Ferguson had enough time to evaluate Kirk's message, Ferguson replied with the following:\"Yes. If I look at five videos, and in those five videos you say things that seem to be biased to the point of being a racist or bigoted how many more videos do I need to see before I make a conclusion? If you're trying to elevate all people, no one can say Mr. Kirk did that and that's what I was getting at.\"Guardiola countered Ferguson’s claims, arguing that Kirk's stance on DEI and affirmative action was not racist.\"It's a merit system,\" he stated, adding that while Kirk didn't make too many appearances at Black colleges and universities, he welcomed discussions from people with all perspectives. \"He wanted the younger 18, 19-year-olds to have their own minds and say, 'Speak for yourself and talk and speak the truth.'\"When asked what message he would send to Ferguson, Guardiola encouraged him to \"go back and watch Charlie Kirk and learn about him. I believe in free speech but when you're talking about hate speech without knowing the background, you can't be doing that.\"However, Ferguson stood firm in his position.\"Anybody who wants to have an honest dialogue then have an honest dialogue, but I won't be bullied by anyone as far as that goes,\" he said. \"I'm going to always advocate for our children here. I'm definitely not stepping down.\"WPTV has reached out to the Florida Department of Education and the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis for further comments, and we await their response.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

However, they weren't allowed to introduce it to the jury because it wasn't related to the alleged assassination attempt.Prosecutors argued these attempts at creating a makeshift gun months before his arrest showed Routh's intent to commit violence months before his arrest.The jury on Thursday heard from a former sniper. He served as an expert witness for the prosecution to show Routh had the intent to create violence at Trump International Golf Club.The sniper said Routh's decisions are similar to the training techniques he learned in the military.This included going on operations at night, hiding in the bushes, using a scope, using a fence to help aim a weapon. The sniper testified that Routh's selection of Trump's golf course to conduct a shooting was similar to predicting movements for a target.Prosecutors also showed a list that included a green poncho, bug spray and diapers — all objects the sniper said are useful when hiding.Routh is representing himself in the trial.Routh's federal charges include:Attempted assassination of a major presidential candidatePossessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violenceAssaulting a federal officerFelon in possession of a firearm and ammunitionPossession of a firearm with an obliterated serial numberThe trial is expected to run for two or three weeks.Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch fuse.More of WPTV's coverage of Trump assassination attempt below:\n    \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n

His husband suffers from severe lung disease. Sanford said it’s gotten to the point where they are now talking about traveling to another state just to get the boost.“Yes, of course! I don't need to have my husband die on me from not being able to get a vaccine,” he said.Local pharmacies are also finding themselves in a COVID vaccine bind.The Health Matters Pharmacy in Tampa is waiting for its supply of COVID vaccines but isn’t sure it will ever arrive.“It’s very frustrating,” said Tiara Ross, a nurse practitioner there. “We want to get people vaccinated as early and as quickly as possible, but these barriers are going to make it a little bit more difficult.\"The Food and Drug Administration recently approved updated COVID-19 vaccines, but with limits. The shots are currently limited to people at least 65 years old and those younger with certain health conditions and a prescription from their doctor.The restricted new rules have prompted a wave of confusion among medical professionals and pharmacies, with some of Florida’s most popular drugstores holding off on offering the shot.At Publix, the COVID-19 vaccine is “currently not available” in Florida, according to its website. Same with Walgreens, where the chain is waiting for the official recommendation from the CDC before offering the shot to Floridians. On Friday, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunizations will vote on who can get the COVID shot and if insurance will pay for it. The vaccine is the only agenda item for advisory council to discuss on Friday with a final vote expected in the afternoon. \n    \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        National News\n    \n    \n    CDC vaccine advisory panel changes its recommendations for MMRV vaccines\n\n\n    \n  \n    \n      Maura Barrett\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe meeting is expected to be controversial given the influence of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., a staunch vaccine critic.While states can set their own rules, Florida’s Department of Health appears to be deliberately evasive about the topic. The agency has refused to provide any clarity despite weeks of our emails seeking answers.But in a podcast over the weekend, controversial Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, a vocal critic of the COVID-19 vaccine, announced his hope to shut it down in Florida. “The MRNA, the goal for that is not to be available to anyone because no one should be using that one,” he said during the podcast.Despite all the uncertainty, some Floridians have been successful in getting the shot.“I feel lucky,” said Mark Lebow of Port Charlotte. Lebow is over 65 years old and has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He recently got the booster at a CVS in Venice but had to wait until he had a prescription from his doctor.“I think she wanted the prescription just because she's afraid of corporate backlash, or something like that,” he said.A vaccine that was once encouraged and available to all, now up in the air and fueling some concerns in Florida that it will become out of reach.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    Copyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc.

Ryan Chamberlin, R-Belleview, told WPTV that he has a plan.The first part of the plan, which he calls \"Freedom 1,2,3\", involves a rollback of property tax rates to numbers in 2023, putting revenue projections at $43 billion. Then he proposes a 5% transaction fee on real estate sales.Chamberlin said he wants to wipe out property taxes, reel in expected revenue and replace the dollars with a combination of fees and sales taxes, starting with an upfront payment when buying a home.\"Right now, there currently is no sales tax when you buy a home; you just get billed the rest of your life,\" Chamberlin said. \"I brought that to a 5% transaction fee, which could be incorporated into your amount financed; it equates to a much, much smaller amount.\"Another 5% sales tax would be imposed on travel-related transactions such as hotels and rideshare trips. The final part of the plan is a three-cent sales tax to benefit school districts.\"The state is not going to spend it however they want; it is specific for schools and three cents will generate $20 billion,\" Chamberlin said.\n    \n    \n    \n        \n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        Real Estate News\n    \n    \n    Ending property taxes?

Ron DeSantis or the committee co-chaired by state Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart.\"There are a tremendous (number) of ideas coming forward, everything from either a monetary straightforward homestead exemption to a percentage associated with it,\" Overdorf told WPTV earlier this month.\"I believe we can wipe out pretty much statewide property taxes with this plan if we come to a conclusion that we only want to deal with homestead exemption taxes,\" Chamberlin said.Chamberlin said he expects some opposition to his plan, but it will be discussed among lawmakers when the special committee on property taxes meets Monday.\"I expect to be fully debated,\" Chamberlin said about his plan. \"If somebody comes up with better ideas, bring them on.\"\n    Matt Sczesny is determined every day to help you find solutions in Florida's coverage collapse.
