The plan includes 781 residential units, 150,000 square feet of retail space, 68,276 square feet of office, 2,729 parking spaces, and a 185-room hotel. Residents push back on massive 77-acre development near I-95 in Boca Raton Some neighbors, including Greg Koslowski, who live adjacent to the site, are raising concerns about traffic, noise and impacts to wildlife.“There’s coyotes back here, there’s fox, turtles, all kinds of wildlife that I don’t know where they’re going to go,” said Koslowski.Koslowski’s main concern is congestion in the neighborhood, as Torah Academy across the street, is already expanding.The project will also include restaurants, a grocery store, a transit center, and park space.“It’s going to be Mizner Park x7. In this little patch of area,” said Roxanna Trinka. “We don’t have the infrastructure to support it.”WPTV’s Zitlali Solache also heard from some neighbors who support the plan but others questioned if high-rise buildings near the flight path of airport planes would be impacted.“They come in very low, right over the treetops,” said Koslowski. “I can’t image what kind of buildings or structures they can put in there without impeding on that airspace.”According to the master plan, developers said mixing housing with retail and office space would reduce traffic. They add the site’s location, between I-95 and a residential neighborhood, make it ideal for development. It includes 53% open space, which is above the city's requirement of 25% and is within walking distance from Florida Atlantic University and Yamato Road Tri Rail station.Still, many fear the project will erase what's left of the city’s green space.“I hope that whatever land is left in Boca, that maybe we can hold onto it, and leave something for the future,” said Koslowski.The project heads to a public hearing on Tuesday, November 18, before the Planning and Zoning board. The public hearing is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Boca Raton Community Center Annex Building 260 Crawford Boulevard.

    "content": "NewsEducation Teacher facing charges was rehired despite previous misconduct allegations A new lawsuit claims multiple employees observed Pierce’s excessive attention to female students at Tradewinds Middle School WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — The School District of Palm Beach County hired a man as a substitute teacher even though he resigned from another school for inappropriate behavior with students, according to a new federal lawsuit.Students would later complain about the teacher, Corey Pierce, being seen kissing students from Woodlands Middle School. Pierce is now facing two counts of lewd or lascivious battery by authority figure of a school after his arrest in March. Teacher facing charges was rehired despite previous school misconduct claims The documents WPTV’s Ethan Stein reviewed over the last month related to the case create new questions about why Pierce was allowed to leave his original job at Tradewinds Middle School, then get a job at another school within the school district as a substitute teacher. According to a Title IX investigation report, Pierce was “let go/fired” from teaching at Tradewinds Middle School. However, the detail contradicts his personnel file showing he resigned from his job as an employee within the school office in January 2024. Payroll records WPTV reviewed show before his resignation, Pierce suddenly started having days where he was marked as “without pay,” starting in October 2023. However, emails WPTV received show no district internal investigation was open until Pierce’s arrest.This new lawsuit claims multiple employees observed Pierce’s excessive attention to female students at Tradewinds Middle School and it reached the level where Pierce had to resign from his position at the school. However, the school didn’t investigate the employee nor did employees report those behaviors to school administrators, which in turn allowed the employee to get another position within the same district. Education 2 school district staffers accused of inappropriate relations with students “School Board knew or should have known that Pierce was not fit for service as a school employee and that he never should have been permitted to be around children,” the lawsuit reads. “Pierce has concerning behavior patterns were observable to multiple employees yet school board failed to properly investigate, failed to take corrective action and ultimately made the catastrophic decision to rehire him after his resignation, directly enabling the continuation of his abuse of (VICTIM) and multiple other students.”Pierce would get a new position at Woodlands Middle School as a substitute teacher in February 2024. The teacher, according to a Title IX investigation report, was then accused of trying to lean over and kiss a student in March, then trying to touch the student’s butt along with messaging students on social media and other inappropriate touching in March 2024.The lawsuit also claims district investigators didn’t follow protocol when interviewing their client, who is a minor. Attorneys called it “traumatic and unprofessional” to conduct the interview without a counselor present and in a manner that was insensitive to a victim of sexual abuse. This included the investigator laughing about the teacher having “a type” when discussing other victims, which is supported in the body camera footage reviewed by WPTV.The School District of Palm Beach County said it can’t comment on pending litigation in an email. Pierce’s trial, which was supposed to begin on Monday, was rescheduled after a scheduling conflict. His public defender told WPTV they are unable to provide a comment to the lawsuit at this time because the criminal case is ongoing.",

By: Vannia Joseph Posted and last updated BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — A Little Free Pantry and Library that has quietly served neighbors in Boynton Beach for nearly five years is now at the center of a community fight.In the Forest Park neighborhood, Ace Tilton Ratcliff and their partner, Derek Calhoon, opened the small outdoor pantry in 2021 to help families in need — offering free food, toiletries, and books, no questions asked. WATCH: Single complaint could lead to loss of neighborhood resource Community fights to save neighborhood pantry after code complaint But after a single complaint filed with the city's code enforcement office, their community resource could soon be removed. \"We've literally had people knock on our door and tell us the little free pantry is the only reason they got to eat that day,\" Ratcliff said.The pantry was built with the help of the B'nai Torah Congregation's TLC Charlie Fund and didn't require permits or special permission at the time. But earlier this year, the city cited the pantry and library for violating rules related to accessory structures.Ratcliff and Calhoun say the complaint came from someone outside their neighborhood and they are now being forced to consider removing the resource — unless city leaders change the rules.\"Sometimes it really is the difference between getting to eat that day and not,\" Ratcliff added. What started as a small project to support neighbors has grown into a thriving hub for community care. Inside, you'll find canned goods, whole milk, toilet paper, and pasta just steps away from free books for kids and adults. Palm Beach County Delays on SNAP funding putting strain on local food banks Ange Toussaint More than 600 people have signed a petition asking the Boynton Beach City Commission to revise its land development regulations, similar to what nearby cities like Lake Worth Beach and Delray Beach have done. Those changes would allow Little Free Pantries and Libraries to safely remain in front or side yards — like a mailbox. \"It's obviously good — why isn't the city just as excited that people are trying to help their community?\" said Calhoun. The couple and many of their neighbors showed up to the most recent city commission meeting to make their plea. So far, they've been granted a six-month extension — but they're hoping for a more permanent fix.\"What we're looking for is a code amendment that will not only allow Little Free Libraries and Little Free Pantries to safely exist within Boynton Beach… but also set standards for how they're built,\"Ratcliff explained.WPTV reached out to the city of Boynton Beach to ask:Whether the city is exploring ways to accommodate or support community-run pantries and librariesIf commissioners are considering future changes to the land development rulesHow residents can work with officials to resolve this issueWPTV is still awaiting a response.Supporters of the pantry have launched a petition urging city leaders to protect these small community structures.

By: Dave Bohman Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — While Congress and President Donald Trump appear ready to make Jeffrey Epstein investigative files public, the Justice Department's announcement that it will investigate Democrats listed in the files could create more delays. Attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents nine Epstein victims, said ongoing investigations may prevent full disclosure of information victims have long sought. WATCH: Lawyer for Epstein victims has concerns about lost or destroyed info Epstein files release faces potential delays despite congressional support \"That means that there may be a quote ongoing investigation that would prevent them from releasing information that is part of that ongoing investigation,\" Kuvin said. \"So that could put a little bit of a wrench into the full disclosure of what the victims have always wanted, which is full disclosure, except for the identity of the victims.\" Kuvin represents women who say they were sexually abused as high school teenagers at Epstein's Palm Beach estate. Years after the abuse, the women continue demanding justice. In multiple interviews, Kuvin has consistently said some of his clients' abusers include some of the most wealthy and politically powerful people in America. WPTV Investigates How much did Trump know about what went on at Epstein's home? Dave Bohman When asked about concerns that information may have been lost or destroyed, Kuvin expressed serious reservations.\"This information has been sought after for going on 20 years at this point,\" Kuvin said. \"And if they got rid of, destroyed, or lost information that they knew was integral to an investigation, then I wouldn't then hesitate to say that it was intentional.\"The measure calling for the release of the Epstein files is expected to pass the U.S. House on Monday, then the Senate later this week, before heading to Trump for approval.However, even with congressional and presidential support, there is no timetable for the files' release, and several potential reasons for delay remain.President Trump, who opposed the release of Epstein investigative documents, reversed course and called for the files to be released. Area Congressman Brian Mast, who is one of President Trump's staunchest supporters in Congress, released this statement about the release of the files: Jeffrey Epstein was a vile and abhorrent human being who committed terrible atrocities to so many. Congressman Mast has always supported full transparency on this matter while keeping the wellbeing of the victims front and center.

By: Kayla McDermott Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — Airlines are resuming their normal schedules as the FAA lifts flight restrictions that affected 40 major airports during the recent government shutdown, bringing some relief to travelers just days before Thanksgiving.The lifting of restrictions comes as a relief for people flying over Thanksgiving weekend, which is the busiest air travel period of the year, according to TSA data. However, while the government has reopened, many TSA workers are still struggling financially after going without pay during the 43-day shutdown.WATCH BELOW: TSA workers await paychecks after government shutdown ends TSA workers await paychecks after government shutdown ends TSA agents across South Florida said they won't see a paycheck for another week, leaving many still scrambling to pay bills and basic expenses. \"There's still a lot of struggles,\" said Mickey Alston, a union official with the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) who represents TSA workers from the Melbourne Airport to Fort Myers and Key West.Workers have gone so long without pay that Alston says some workers were unable to pay rent on the first of this month.\"People are threatening with an eviction notice,\" she said.When asked how many people have received eviction notices, Alston said one agent has already received an eviction notice, while two others are working out arrangements with landlords.Alston said she and other agents expected things to improve once the shutdown ended, noting that during previous shutdowns, workers typically received paychecks within a week of reopening. But this weekend, Alston and fellow TSA agent Damian De'Leonardo received a notice from the Department of Homeland Security saying paychecks won't be issued until Monday.\"We've been borrowing from banks, you know, taking out loans,\" Alston said. \"I'm not even entirely sure how they break everything down. I don't know if they're going to just give it to us all in one lump sum, or if they're just going to give us something, you know, maybe a paycheck, and then work out the rest later.\"\"TSA officers, they live paycheck to paycheck, so it'll be difficult,\" De'Leonardo said.The delayed paychecks mean money will hit their bank accounts for the first time in weeks just days before the holidays. \"Thanksgiving is going to be tough for a lot of federal employees,\" Alston said.The Department of Homeland Security has promised to give all agents who continued working during the shutdown a $10,000 bonus, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stating they would be \"handing out bonus checks.\" However, Alston said none of the agents at airports he represents have heard anything concrete about the $10,000 bonus.When asked how the bonus money would help if it materializes, De'Leonardo said it would be \"tremendous.\" But until that happens Alston believes, \"the officers would just be satisfied, at least just getting their paycheck because we don't have anything right now.\"To get through the next week, agents say people are still relying on food banks and donations, especially ahead of Thanksgiving. Those who want to help TSA workers can contact Alston directly at meak77@msn.com.\"We do need hygiene products such as soap, deodorant, lotions. You know, we need baby Pampers. We need baby formulas. So anybody that wants to help out with that, we need gas card. We definitely need gas cards, because we have to get to and from work. So whatever anyone can do and food products as well.

But for a group of high school students, their path to success has hit a snag.We found out the written portions of their AP exams from May 2025 were damaged by the carrier while on its way to the College Board. Sixty-five students from Seminole Ridge High School were affected.

By: Zitlali Solache Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Residents are weighing in as the city of Delray Beach is preparing to launch a multi-million dollar project to rebuild its eroding shoreline.City officials say the beach renourishment effort is set to begin this winter, costing an estimated $19.2 million.WATCH BELOW: Delray Beach set to begin $19M shoreline rebuild project Delray Beach set to begin $19M shoreline rebuild project Commissioner Juli Casale said it will add 325,000 cubic yards of sand to eroded areas from rising sea levels.\"Over time with storms, and what have you, the beaches wash away and you have less beach than what you should have or what you normally have,\" said Casale.The last nourishment project was completed in 2020. According to city leaders, it will be funded by the federal government, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Palm Beach County and the City of Delray Beach.\"It's costly and you know, we don’t expend this kind of money unless it’s necessary,\" said Casale.City leaders said beach access will remain open throughout the project, although some areas in the south end may see temporary impacts.WPTV reporter Zitlali Solache spoke with beachgoers as the project comes with concerns about its environmental impact, cost and timing.\"We read about adding more sand. We didn’t understand why because there’s enough sand here,” said Isak Cozen. \"Wouldn't you be better off doing it in June, July, August, September, when fewer people are here?\"Since others cited concerns for coral reefs, Casale stated she is working on discussing long-term solutions to rebuild them on coastal nourishment projects.City leaders say the project is not only necessary for the shoreline but also important for tourism. The project is expected to be completed by early 2026.",
