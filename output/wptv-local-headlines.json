President Donald Trump, alongside top health officials, is pointing to a possible connection between taking acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — during pregnancy and rising cases of autism and ADHD.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Doctors urge caution as Trump admin links Tylenol use in pregnancy to autism spike Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used medications in the United States, often recommended to treat pain and fever — especially for pregnant women who are limited in what medications they can safely take.But now, federal officials say new research raises concerns about its potential impact on fetal development.\"With Tylenol, don't take it. Don't take it,\" President Trump said during a news conference Monday night.The administration's position was backed by FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary, who cited a major Harvard study backed by Mount Sinai.\"To quote the dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, there is a causal relationship between prenatal acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders of ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder,\" said Dr. Makary.Study Cited Finds Association — Not Proof of CauseThe study referenced during the announcement found an association between prenatal acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental conditions. However, it did not prove causation.“Ultimately, there was strong evidence of an association between prenatal acetaminophen use and increased risk of other NDDs in children,” the study’s summary read.Health Experts Urge Caution in Interpreting ResultsIn response to the announcement, WPTV’s Michael Hoffman spoke with Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a professor at Johns Hopkins Medical School who specializes in medication use during pregnancy. She says the White House may have overstated the findings.\"It's not as black and white,\" Rasmussen said. \"One study does not make causation. I don't think the evidence is there. I'm not saying that it's impossible. The evidence right now is not as clear as it was presented in the news conference today. And I think that's the important thing.\"National Medical Groups Disagree with AdministrationNational organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), continue to emphasize that no proven causation exists between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. Despite that, officials say we may soon see new warning labels on acetaminophen-based medications — and possibly updated dosage guidelines from physicians.Florida Lawmakers RespondIn Florida, State Senator Lori Berman, who serves on the Health and Human Services Committee, says the state needs to let opts = {email: em , contactlist: '1108847b-4cd4-4e79-b9d4-f3808dbf02c5'}; }).then();",

I recently visited the Esperanza Community Center in West Palm Beach — a true beacon of hope, not only for Hispanic families in the Northwood area, but for anyone striving to lift future generations.“Esperanza means hope, hope in our community, hope in our future, hope in each one of us, ”said Maricela Torres, co-founder and executive director.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's Janny Rodriguez's conversation with Maricela Torres Esperanza Community Center brings hope to West Palm Beach families during Hispanic Heritage Month Maricela Torres proudly showed me around the community center in its new location and talked with me about some of the critical needs they are meeting.“We don’t want the parents to not participate because they don’t have childcare,” said Torres.The childcare space allows working parents to access resources — without the extra cost of a babysitter.They keep their “catch-all room” stocked with diapers for their monthly distribution, currently supporting 98 babies.“Families are struggling, although they are working and they’re making such an effort to put food on the table and have shelter, there are those other necessities like baby diapers that may go unpurchased,” said Torres.They also keep an emergency food pantry. She told me it’s to meet families where they are. “Sometimes we may have a family that is in desperate need of food and they can’t wait for that one-month distribution that we do.”Right now, between 65 and 70 families are registered to receive food.“For me it is so important to provide the resources that they need right now so that they can then focus on what they need to do to improve their life,” said Torres.Improving the lives of the families they serve is the foundation of the Esperanza Community Center.Equipped with computers, a printer, and a smart board, their lab is open to anyone in the area who needs access.In their new location, there’s also space for workshops, adult literacy classes, and even a summer art camp for kids.“Many of those kids had never been to camp before and it was an experience, it was an art immersive program with a schedule from beginning to end, then they had an exhibit,” said Torres.The center runs on donations to keep its doors open. But they also need volunteers.“If you have a skill or something that you like to teach, call us,” said Torres.In fact, she told me there’s a huge need for a night English class, but they need reliable volunteers who can commit.“Come to the Esperanza Center, we welcome everybody, you don’t have to be Hispanic, you don’t have to be Spanish speaking,” said Torres. ; }).then();",

However, Michelle Franklin, the St. Lucie County Property Appraiser, explained why homeowners will still pay more.\"Most property owners will see an increase in their taxes, because the value increased, the value that we assessed on January 1 increased more than the reduction of the millage rate,\" Franklin said.Port St. Lucie's rapid growth is driving the tax increases.

By: Kayla McDermott Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A family is still grieving the loss of a man who police say was shot and killed by his own daughter last month outside a middle school in West Palm Beach. Leroy Scott was allegedly shot in the back by his daughter, Leah Scott, during a confrontation outside his home along Haden Avenue, not far from Bak Middle School. \"He was a phenomenal man, phenomenal. He basically raised all of us,\" said Carmonia Campbell, Leroy's niece. WATCH: Grieving family says getting justice for Leroy is paramount Family reels after teacher allegedly kills her own father Looking through the archives of photos from various vacations and moments, Leroy’s nephew, Adrian Moncrieffe, says, \"I have a lifelong list of memories. He'll never be forgotten.” He and his cousin are still coming to grips with the fact no new photos of their uncle will be added to the albums. As is Leroy’s sister, Uvarline Scott, who says Leroy had been by her side almost every day since she was two. “He was the kind of brother that any sister wants to have,” Uvarline shared. According to police, Leah Scott admitted to the shooting. Investigators say she confronted her father outside his home, telling him to stop bothering her. When he reportedly replied, \"Get out of my face\" before walking away, police say Leah shot her father in the back. \"It was very shocking and hard to believe,\" Moncrieffe said. \"It's like my whole world shattered, your whole body just crumbles.

It might be somebody in my family, it might be somebody else,\" Dale told WPTV reporter Jon Shainman during our \"Let's Hear It\" event in Juno Beach.We visited her North Palm Beach home a few weeks ago and saw the line for ourselves, which was about 8 feet off the ground.We reached out to some agencies and gave Dale their numbers to contact.She discovered the wire in question was not a power line but instead a utility cable.\"I didn’t know. I thought someone would get electrocuted, but they assured me no one would get electrocuted,\" Dale said.There are guidelines on how high both power lines and utility lines have to be placed in Florida.WPTV reached out to the Florida Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities.A spokesperson replied, \"There is not a single uniform height requirement for power and utility lines in residential neighborhoods.\"They referred us to the National Electrical Safety Code, which outlines multiple clearance standards. The code recommends that electrical lines in residential neighborhoods be 15 and a half feet high. Communication lines for cable, phone and internet are usually placed lower on power poles and need at least a 10-foot clearance depending on the voltage.After several weeks of waiting, Dale sent WPTV a video of a contractor for the cable company fixing the wire.\"I feel terrific because I'm not worried that some limb is going to fall on it,\" Dale said. \"You know it's always good to know somebody.
