Deputies say a drunk man came to the store with a gun, threatening to kill one woman, leading her into the store and telling everyone else to get out.WATCH: Worker tells deputies man was going through 'mental health crisis' Store worker pulls gun on armed man, wrestles weapon away in parking lot The worker behind the counter decided to take action, reaching into her purse and pulling out her own gun. Surveillance video shows the worker pushing the suspect out of the store.The suspect was identified as Calvert Allen. The employee pointed a gun at Allen's face, and deputies say she began wrestling him for his gun in the parking lot.Investigators say the woman fired two warning shots at Allen, then hit him with her gun until she was able to get control of his handgun, which she turned over to a responding deputy.\"I have the gun,\" the deputy can be heard saying in the video.Allen is a frequent customer who the worker knows.\"He's going through a mental health crisis, he just got out of the behavioral health center,\" the worker said.Once in custody, Allen told deputies in an interview that he contemplated shooting the worker in what \"he believed would have been self-defense,\" but says he decided against it because \"he liked her.\" The worker, who did not want to go on camera, said she wants to put the incident behind her but told WPTV she still carries her concealed weapon at all times.Allen is a convicted felon and is now facing new charges, including aggravated assault, possession of weapon/ammunition by a convicted Florida felon, and improper exhibition of firearm or dangerous weapon.

Sixth-grader Mia Hurtado from Sunlight Christian Academy said the hands-on approach made a lasting impact.“We measured the phosphate in the water. We measured the alkalinity, the salinity, and we measured the nitrate in the water,” she said. “Really measuring that and like trying to find ways to lessen the pollution in the water really means a lot to me.” The event is organized by ORCA, the Ocean Research & Conservation Association, and brings environmental science to life for over 500 students, from Palm Beach to Volusia counties, through hands-on learning. “The issues are so complex and different up and down the lagoon, so it’s really great to get the students in their area to go to the lagoon,” said Lauren Tracy, director of marketing for ORCA.Educators say engaging students in real-world science reinforces what they learn in the classroom. “You can sit in a classroom environment and you can try to learn and hope that it sticks, but really getting them out into the environment — it’s a better experience,” said Slattery. These educational encounters inspire students like Mia Hurtado, who is passionate about preserving the waterways she cherishes. “If we don’t have the ocean then it can kill, like, our ecosystems and like the fish and the plants in the river and the lagoon,” she said.With every test tube of data collected, these young advocates are learning what it takes to protect their environment.Portions of this story were assisted by artificial intelligence tools and reviewed by a WPTV journalists to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to editorial standards. ; }).then();",

    "content": "NewsEducation Teachers, parents concerned over grading policy in Martin County School District WPTV's Tyler Hatfield is hearing from teachers and school board members and the executive director of curriculum and instruction on the policy WPTV By: Tyler Hatfield Posted and last updated MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — A grading policy in the Martin County School District is creating concern for some teachers and parents. Math teacher John Speck spoke at the school board meeting on Tuesday, sharing his concern about the way Martin County grades its students.WATCH BELOW: 'We are talking about students learning,' Daniel Moore tells WPTV Teachers, parents concerned over a grading policy in this school district Under the policy, the lowest score a student can receive is 50%, even if they don’t complete assignments.“This policy sets a dangerous precedent,” said Speck. “It tells our students that effort doesn't matter and that failure will be erased for convenience, rather than corrected through learning.”School board members also raised concerns.“I do not think it's a good idea for us to be giving a 50% to students that turn in nothing,” said Marsha Powers.“If they're just not working, I don't believe we should be giving them the opportunity when they are not putting in any effort at all,” said Amy Pritchett.WPTV went looking for answers from the school district.Daniel Moore, executive director of curriculum and instruction, said the policy isn’t new and has been in place since the 2023-24 school year, after a committee of administrators, union members and teachers, decided to switch from a 100-point scale to a 5-point scale: A, B, C, D, and F.Moore said 50% is still an “F” grade, but it does give students an opportunity to rebound with improved scores.“When you give a student a zero, it has a significantly higher impact on their overall grade,” said Moore. “Ultimately an F being an F, the weight really is on the quizzes, tests and assessments.”It’s an issue now, Moore said, because teachers are just starting to change the way they grade.“Even though it has been policy for almost three years, we have teachers that have not been in compliance with policy, and our school administrators have been requiring them to be in alignment,” said Moore.Moore said the grading system puts the district in line with the state’s grading scale. He adds it can also help students succeed. Giving students scores below 50, Moore said, serves no purpose.“We are talking about students learning,\" said Moore. \"If a students get a 10 or 15, and your intention as a teacher is to leave that in a grade book, you are failing that student.” However, Speck sees it differently.“Grades are not just arbitrary numbers,” said Speck. “They represent what a student has learned and mastered. To artificially inflate them, in effect, is to falsify them.” ; }).then();",

Boca Raton plans to lease public land and in exchange for new government campus, developers are also proposing a mix-used hotel and retail space.Save Boca said it has collected more than 7,000 signatures from Boca Raton voters who are against the development.The complaint said no data or public poll was conducted to determine whether the majority of voters in Boca Raton want this amendment, as Save Boca suggests.READ FULL LAWSUIT: Jon Pearlman, founder of Save Boca, which has been against the development, said the complaint is baseless.“Every single person and the city and also the supervisor of elections adhered to every law throughout this process,” Pearlman said. “There is an affidavit on every single petition that was signed by the collector of the petition saying they witnessed every single signature.”The complaint also suggests that if the referendum goes through, it would “paralyze” the city’s ability to use public land to donate to nonprofits, affecting more than just big developers.WATCH PREVIOUS COVERAGE BELOW: Save Boca group advances petition against controversial downtown government campus development In a previous interview with Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer, he discussed the implications of a future referendum.“It would imperil the city’s ability to convey any sort of land including for property owners; nonprofits,\" Singer said. \"It would dramatically impact the way we do business with nonprofits.\" In a statement to WPTV about the complaint, Supervisor of Elections Wendy Satory Link said the following: \"We’ll do as the courts and the city clerk direct us.\" Boca Raton has until Oct. 31 to finalize an interim agreement with developers on the project.Read more of WPTV's related coverage below: Real Estate News Mayor looks to clear up confusion ahead of possible city makeover Kendall Hyde Real Estate News Boca Raton to begin series of open house events to discuss redevelopment Victor Jorges Boca Raton Boca Raton leaders agree to referendum on Government Campus project Ange Toussaint Boca Raton 'Too important': Residents, veterans push to save this historic park Kayla McDermott Real Estate News 'We don't want it': Residents call for pause on Boca Redevelopment Plan Ange Toussaint Boca Raton Developers present 'revised' plan for downtown campus Audra Schroeder Real Estate News She was 'perturbed' by our story, so we wanted to get her side Matt Sczesny Boca Raton 'Save Boca' petition advances after collecting 3,616 verified signatures Ange Toussaint Boca Raton More than 5,000 residents rally to block Boca Raton's new development plan Ange Toussaint ; }).then();",

The Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office (OCSO) says that the accident, which occurred Monday at the intersection of 128th Avenue and Highway 70 West, was caused by another driver crossing into the school bus' lane.

They say the investigation, led by Traffic Homicide Investigator Corporal Adrian Rogers, confirmed his initial findings: \"That the passenger vehicle crossed over the center line by several feet.\" Investigators say the bus driver attempted to avoid collision, but the other vehicle continued into the lane. The accident sent eight students and the bus driver to the hospital, though they did not sustain serious injuries. OCSO also addressed \"speculation and misinformation\" around the crash, as to who was at fault: \"To be clear, the investigation has confirmed—without doubt—that the passenger vehicle crossed into the bus’s lane, and the school bus driver acted swiftly and appropriately to protect the students on board and avoid a more serious collision.\" ; }).then();",

By: Kate Hussey Posted WATCH BELOW - The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later Sitting at a rental property with her husband, Charley Dahlonega recounts the storm that will haunt her memory forever. On Oct. 9, 2024, an EF2 tornado ripped through her Okeechobee property during Hurricane Milton, burying her and her husband, John Alberigi III, alive in the rubble. \"I was literally buried up to my neck with one arm out, and I'm trying to push the dryer off of me,\" Dahlonega said while describing the moments after the tornado struck. \"The sheriff told me not to push the dryer because I was surrounded by electrical wire and cow fence, so I was sort of cooked.\"That tornado was one of 46 to touch down across Florida. Dahlonega said the trailer they lived in was lifted several yards into the air and either \"imploded or exploded,\" depending on the witness. She was found near a roadside fence beneath a dryer; the blow fractured her skull. Her husband was buried nearby, she said, his face and ribs broken. He spent months in rehabilitation.\"John was in rehab until mid-December,\" she said. \"By then, FEMA had us, had me in a hotel, and I didn't have transportation to do much of anything.\"Now, a year after the disaster, the couple is rebuilding their lives while Dahlonega cares for her husband, who has dementia.\"I have memories of this entire year, and [I'm] hoping someday they'll go away, but they're still quite fresh in my memory. The trauma,\" Dahlonega said. The couple have moved twice since the tornado, living in a combination of hotels and motels after their home was destroyed and nearly everything they owned was lost. Dahlonega said she and John are now living in a rental property while a house is being built for them in Lake Placid, Florida, and she hoped to move before the anniversary of the storm.\"We were hoping to be gone four months ago,\" she said. \"But you know, if you've ever had a home built, you can imagine what it is we're going through, so we're just waiting to get moved.”The trauma of the tornado has lingered. Dahlonega said she now struggles with anxiety when bad weather approaches and has trouble sleeping.\"I got to where if it's going to rain, I can't drive, I can't. I just panic. And I'm still trying to work through that aspect,\" said Dahlonega. Caring for her husband has only added to the challenges of recovery. Without a car or a home to return to, Dahlonega and her husband were separated for months — he often wondered why she wasn't coming to pick him up from the rehab facility.\"It was devastating,\" said Dahlonega. \"I had the skull fracture, and the only thing I could think is I have to get up and find a place to live. We had nothing. The home was destroyed. Everything we owned was destroyed. So, I mean, I made every effort to get to him every day and promise him the next day, the next day.\" Dahlonega said on Dec. 15, three months after the tornado, her husband's brother picked him up from rehab and brought him to the hotel they were staying at. \"That was on my birthday, Dec.15. He came home. What was home at the time,\" said Dahlonega, getting emotional. \"It's...it's better. I mean, just knowing he's here, it's a peace of mind. I don't worry so much. He's my honey bear. We're going to make it. We're going to be fine.\" Navigating FEMA and other agencies was difficult for Dahlonega, too. \"FEMA moved us into a little motel, nice little motel,\" said Dahlonega. \"Stayed there for two months, and then after that, FEMA gave us a check for a month's rent, basically told us hit the road. So, I hit the road with all that FEMA had given us.\" She also pointed to other gaps in the recovery system: the difficulty replacing identification and legal documents lost in the storm, the hardship of tracking federal assistance, and the theft and pilfering of property left unattended after the storm. Dahlonega said she has had to reimburse a new property owner for a stolen well pump and has seen sheds and metal disappear from the site.\"I will only have bad memories of Okeechobee, because I don't feel the community rallied together to help with what happened here,\" said Dahlonega. Still, she emphasized resilience. After months without reliable transportation, she recently bought a vehicle and has begun visiting the Lake Placid property where the new house is being completed.\"I finally got a vehicle, and I'm able to do a little more,\" she said. \"We're going to be fine. It's like, come hell or high water — been through both.\" Her message to others, she said, is to act and persevere.\"I'm hoping people will know that they have — you may not know it, but you've got the strength in you to do the same thing I've done,\" she said. \"We all have the strength in us to survive.\" Yet even as she describes her hope, resilience and perseverance, Dahlonega can't help but feel that gnawing fear in the back of her head: the fear that something else is coming. \"I really thought I had a handle on it, you know? I could take care of us. We were doing it. Everything's good. And then all of a sudden, everything was nothing, like literally nothing,\" said Dahlonega. \"So tomorrow has to be better, right? It has to be better. That's all. Of course, we could get another tornado tomorrow. You know that light at the end of the tunnel? That would be the freight train; another storm before we can get out of here.\" As Dahlonega returns to the labor that keeps her going: preparing for the future, tending a garden she hopes to replant in Lake Placid and caring for John, she said she hopes that by telling her story, others in similar situations might find help or inspiration — and that the system will someday do a better job supporting elderly caregivers caught in the wake of disaster. ; }).then(); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego The Day The Sky Turned The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later WPTV News Surfing Blog New swell in the forecast James Wieland",

Suddenly, the 30 kennels that were once used to house dogs before races, became sanctuaries for dogs that had nowhere to be in the middle of a storm. WPTV “We did not freeze operations,” said Feigel. “We kept moving with the dogs and pulling dogs from different location that were in need.”WATCH PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Furry Friends Ranch in need of donations after storm damage Furry Friends Ranch in need of donations after storm damage from Milton They transformed the space into an intake center, where animals are checked for behavioral and medical issues before being cleared and taken to Furry Friends’ Jupiter location for adoption. About a dozen employees run this facility, which Fiegel compared to an intensive-care unit, a one-stop shop to make sure their animal population is healthy.“For us to use this ground, to pull more animals, to save more animals… it’s just incredible,” he said. WPTV He said fostering and volunteering is one of the most productive ways to help a dog or cat in need.“Shelters, rescues, they won’t fix a dog,\" he said. \"We bring them to the best we can, but a home, a foster, an adoption, is going to fix whatever was.” Hurricane Furry Friends Ranch in need of 'millions of dollars' after storm damage Aja Dorsainvil ; }).then();",

One year after Hurricane Milton, the cigar he was found buried with has become his reminder of resilience and gratitude. By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated WATCH BELOW - The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later George Bustillo sits in the living room of a house rebuilt on the same footprint where a tornado destroyed his previous home a year ago. The house is almost finished, and it's hard for him to believe that just a year ago he was sitting in rubble. \"Time has … flown by. And we're looking forward to celebrating our one-year anniversary because that day we escaped death. Myself, my wife and my dog,\" said Bustillo. \"It's a flurry of emotions, but it's timely, because it's time to think about it again.\" Bustillo described the chaotic afternoon of Oct. 9, 2024, when an EF2 tornado hit Mariner Sands, the Martin County community where they lived. It ended with him trapped under a beam, his wife pulled from the rubble and both of them alive.\"I said to [my wife], when you hear this famous sound of the train, when you hear the train, take cover,\" said Bustillo. \"I finished saying that, and the house explodes. And the next second I'm buried, and the dog's gone and everything is chaos.\" Bustillo called his neighbor, who lives across the street, and asked him for help. \"My wife called my other neighbor and said, 'Come over, the house is gone, we're buried,' and then my wife called 911,\" said Bustillo. Bustillo said he had prepared for Hurricane Milton and checked on neighbors before the storm. He was outside finishing a cigar and took a picture just eight minutes before the house was gone.\"We were overwhelmed with all the warnings,\" he said. Neighbors and first responders reached the home within minutes, Bustillo said. With a floor jack brought by neighbors and the sheriff, rescuers lifted a beam off him. He said he latched onto the sheriff's flak jacket as they pulled him free, while his wife had already been extracted. The two were reunited in a squad car.Bustillo described the rescue as a turning point in his life. \"It's amazing. I was never religious before, and after that, I go to church every Sunday. I know for a fact there was divine intervention,\" he said.WATCH BELOW: Video shows rescue of George Bustillo, wife after tornado Video shows rescue of George Bustillo, wife after Oct. 9, 2024, tornado in Martin County The emotional aftermath has been mixed with frustration over rebuilding and aid. Bustillo said local leaders initially promised to waive reconstruction fees, but he says that promise was not honored. Also, he said that federal assistance and help from his community association were minimal. \"They charged us full price to rebuild,\" he said. \"There was very little help from FEMA as well. We had to fend for ourselves and get ourselves a business loan. I'm retired, and it's a financial hardship.\"His comments reflect broader complaints from some residents in the weeks and months after Milton about communication, insurance shortfalls and the speed of government aid. Bustillo said insurance covered only a set amount that paid the mortgage and left little for rebuilding beyond that.\"I wasn't planning on doing this, and but I'm alive. I'm happy. My wife is alive, my dog is alive,\" he said. \"If I can help others and motivate them, and not to expect anybody to help you. There's no one that's going to help you.\"The experience also changed how he prepares for storms. Bustillo is a former commercial airline pilot who said he's lived in and out of Florida since the 1960s. Yet Bustillo said while hurricanes don't scare him, tornadoes do. He has now reinforced his newly rebuilt home with concrete block and built a bunker adjacent to the bedroom.\"You can't prepare for a tornado,\" he said. \"This is a completely new thing. \"It's hard because tornadoes can spawn in a moment, and then from being dark outside to having a tornado breathing down your neck is. ... It just happens so fast, and once it hits, it's it's over in two seconds.\" Despite the lingering financial strain and scattered rebuilding across the neighborhood, Bustillo and his wife are preparing to move back into the new house in the coming weeks. He said the foundation and structure are new; the layout is slightly larger and built to withstand future storms. \"We worked hard to make that happen. You have to have a carrot and ... you go for the goal,\" Bustillo said. \"I feel very fortunate, and we've worked. My wife has worked very hard to make this happen. It's been a team operation.\"As the community marks the first anniversary of Hurricane Milton, Bustillo said his goal is simple: to be alive and to help others learn from his experience. \"If anyone finds any strength or any information that they didn't know and it helps them, I'm pleased with that. That's the only reason I'm doing the interview,\" he said. ; }).then(); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego The Day The Sky Turned The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later WPTV News Surfing Blog New swell in the forecast James Wieland",

    "content": "WeatherWeather NewsThe Day The Sky Turned Spanish Lakes tornado survivor reflects on 'new world' 1 year after Hurricane Milton Rosie Quaranta left her house 15 minutes before an EF3 tornado tore through her St. Lucie County community Trey Herbert, WPTV News Rosie Quaranta holds up her wedding rings — one of the few treasures recovered from the debris after the tornado destroyed her home. By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated WATCH BELOW - The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later A year after a tornado leveled her home and upended her life, Rosie Quaranta stands in a new house with a lake view, reflecting on the storm, her losses and the small miracles that helped her rebuild.\"I now live in this lovely house. … It's a new world,\" Quaranta said. \"It's a better house than what I had before. I've got some of my own furniture, a screened-in patio, … and God gave me these gorgeous little flowers in front of my lake.\"Quaranta's story is one of resilience. On Oct. 9, 2024, she was at her home in the Spanish Lakes Country Club community in St. Lucie County when an EF1 tornado tore through her mobile home park. She left minutes after the storm hit. Little did she know a second tornado — an EF3 — was still on its way. \"I had this little windstorm. I thought,\" said Quaranta. \"It came through my house, and I was standing in my kitchen, and was about 10 feet from my dining room windows, and they shook. \"I thought I'd better get out of here. So I left, like 15 minutes before the tornado really hit.\" That EF-3 tornado took the lives of six people in her neighborhood, including three of her neighbors. When Quaranta returned to her home, it was in rubble. \"Yeah, somebody called and said, 'Rosie, your house is gone.' I said, 'Yeah, right. What are you talking about?' My house was leveled to the floor — leveled. Wall to wall nothing,\" said Quaranta. Despite losing nearly everything, Quaranta said she has moved forward. She credits the kindness of friends who took her in immediately after the storm.\"This lady knew me for three days and kept begging me to come live with her,\" she said. \"I stayed on a neighbor's couch, then finally moved in with her. People can be so nice. It was unbelievable.\"WATCH BELOW: Video shows rescue of Rosie Quaranta's neighbor after tornado Video shows rescue of Rosie Quaranta's neighbor at Spanish Lakes Country Club after Oct. 9, 2024 tornado Her reflections are deeply personal. Quaranta said she and her late husband were married at that home. She said he would have been devastated to see its destruction. Yet sentimental belongings found in the storm's wake helped her move on — with spirits high. \"My friends came and they picked up little things, and I might have about ten Santa Clauses. I don't know what houses they came from, but they were big enough that people could find them,\" joked Quaranta. \"But they found little things, and my wedding rings were found. I couldn't believe it.\" The storm also changed her outlook on possessions.\"I no longer save things,\" Quaranta said. \"I used to keep little things because I might need them. Well, I don't need anything anymore. I would like a companion, maybe a partner, but I have a house, I'm alive, and I'm getting better.\" Quaranta said she has also adjusted to the changes in her neighborhood. Many of the mobile homes destroyed last year have been replaced with new manufactured homes, while others remain empty lots or green space.\"I don't look back. To look back is sadness,\" said Quaranta. \"My house is just a yard. I mean, it's great. Grass is growing there now, but there's always tomorrow. Sun's going to come up tomorrow, whether you like it or not, and whether you're sad or happy, it's coming up like clockwork.\" The Day The Sky Turned TORNADO TIMELINE: When, where the storms hit on Oct. 9, 2024 It wasn't always easy to move forward. She lost her home — and many of her neighbors lost their lives, including the man next door, whose wife had come to check on her moments before the second tornado struck.\"Apparently, she knew it was a tornado that hit my patio. I was oblivious. She lost her husband, and she had a broken back,\" said Quaranta, \"And the other neighbor, he couldn't find his girlfriend.\" Quaranta said for a long time she still had to process those memories. \"I didn't realize a lot of things. Things came back very slowly. I think only now have I probably got most of my memory back,\" said Quaranta. \"I guess it was the shock because I couldn't have faced it.\" Now, Quaranta is living in another manufactured home she purchased in the same park in the Spanish Lakes Country Club community. \"I found this house as I was thinking I wasn't going to be able to afford one because they were getting expensive, but there was one for sale, and I got lucky. I found it and bought it that day,\" said Quaranta. Reflecting on the storm's impact, Quaranta shares a message of hope and gratitude.\"I just, you know, you do what you gotta do. And you just live your life. I don't know why I'm still here. It's unbelievable how this old lady could still live, but here I am,\" said Quaranta. For her, surviving the tornado was not just about rebuilding a home — it was about rediscovering the value of life, community and the small blessings that make it meaningful. ; }).then(); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego The Day The Sky Turned The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later WPTV News Surfing Blog New swell in the forecast James Wieland",
