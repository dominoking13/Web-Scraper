The accounts are usually new and often post multiple times on the same date, deputies said, and victims are asked to send money up front, then pressured with additional “fees” for transport, boarding, or veterinary care.In some cases, they threaten that the animal will be euthanized if the money is not sent. The Martin County Sheriff’s Office advises those interested in buying or adopting an animal to do the following:• Research breeders, shelters, or rescue groups thoroughly before sending money.• Be cautious of new social media pages with little activity or identical posting dates.• Because a pet is such a large investment, always ask to see the animal in person and meet the breeder before making any payments. If the seller refuses or makes excuses, consider it a red flag and do not move forward.• Never send payment through gift cards, wire transfers, or peer-to-peer apps to people you do not know. ; }).then();",

On Dec. 2, 2024, Boca Raton High School was placed in Code Red for two and a half hours after an anonymous phone call stating there was a bomb in the bathroom. The caller, later identified as Bullard, also said he had an AR-15 rifle, threatened to kill someone and would shoot responding police officers. During the investigation, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO) learned that Miami-Dade School Police had experienced two to three false bomb reports that day with similar threats. In April 2025, authorities traced the threats to a residence in Leesburg, Florida. The Leesburg Police Department seized electronic devices from the home and shared the findings with PBSO, linking the case to the December threats. Investigators later identified Bullard as a suspect.Detectives said Bullard, who was 17 at the time, admitted to making the false threats to Boca Raton High and three Miami-Dade schools, none of which he had attended. He told investigators he was on Discord with multiple people coaching him on what to say.

Since then, two other professors at the school have also been put on leave for their social media posts in the wake of Kirk’s assassination. WATCH: Dr. Karen Leader speaks to WPTV FAU professor placed on leave over Charlie Kirk posts breaks silence Dr. Leader, an associate professor of art history, confirmed to Hoffman she was the professor referenced in the university’s announcement. The school said in part, “Our focus remains on our academic community’s responsibility to promote civil discourse, conduct healthy debate, and treat one another with respect.”“I wanted to have a chance to speak to my community and have them see what I'm trying to say,” Leader said. Leader said she has received death threats and had her home and work addresses leaked online. She told Hoffman this was the first time she left her home in nearly a week. “I don't know if I'll go right back home after this and then stay there for another five days,” she said.WATCH: 'That's what so striking to me, the violence' FAU professor Karen Leader on free speech Leader showed Hoffman the posts she shared on X that called Kirk “racist, transphobic, homophobic and more.” In those posts, she added the words, “This was Charlie Kirk.”She said she has since deleted a post alleging Kirk used a racial slur after finding it was not true, but left the other posts up, saying she wanted to start a discourse about what she called the “whitewashing of a controversial figure.” “What I did is posted or reposted a lot of content that offered proof that he had said vile things and targeted populations and demonstrated his bigotry, and I was mostly reposting evidence,” Leader said. Hoffman asked how she she responds to people saying the posts were out context.“Yeah. I would say that if you have a preponderance of evidence, one thing taken out of context does not cancel out the preponderance of evidence. The concerted effort to present him as moderate, as uncontroversial, as just wanting to ask questions, just wanting to have conversations. That's not who he was.”WATCH: Dr. Leader says she is open to pursuing lawsuit to defend free speech Professor says she is open to pursuing lawsuit to defend free speech But the discipline from FAU does not appear to fall along partisan lines. Two other professors, Dr. Kate Polak and Dr. Rebel Cole, were also placed on leave for social media posts following Kirk’s assassination. One, Dr. Cole, was placed on leave for conservative leaning posts. Hoffman reached out to both for interviews. Dr. Cole declined, and Dr. Polak has not responded. Leader said she believes all three professors now share some common ground.“Constitutionally, we're on the same side, and so we have a collective responsibility to, you know, force our university to follow the law,” said Leader. And so if a lawsuit is the way we have to do that, I certainly would.” WATCH: Dr. Leader on Kirk and the public university system Dr. Leader speaks on Charlie Kirk and university system Leader also expressed confidence she will return to the classroom, and left this message for students and the FAU community.“Last thing I want to say is to my students that I'm sorry,” said Leader. “To all my students past, present, to FAU alumni, to FAU parents, what's happening is devaluing their degree, and that's happening all over the state.” MORE WPTV COVERAGE: Boca Raton Second FAU professor placed on leave after controversial political posts Michael Hoffman Region Martin County Teacher removed, investigated over negative Charlie Kirk posts online Joel Lopez Palm Beach County 'I won't be bullied': School board member doubles down on Charlie Kirk comments Joel Lopez ; }).then();",

The things that I have heard from this gentleman, Mr. Kirk, as it relates to the Black experience in this country are definitely things that would make me say I am sorry he passed away, but he did not use his voice effectively.” said Ferguson.This commentary quickly sparked controversy among Kirk's supporters.In an interview with WPTV's Joel Lopez, Ferguson was asked whether he was concerned about potential repercussions from his comments.\"I'm not racist. I don't promote racist ideologies or anything like that so based on my understanding on the groundwork, the rules of the road I should say, no I'm not too worried about that,\" Ferguson responded. \"Whatever happens, will happen but my record since I've been on the board has been pretty exceptional and so I'll stand by that at all times. Being a racist is not a protected group of people.\"Ferguson, who has been the District 7 board member for three years and plans to run for reelection, emphasized that while he does not condone Kirk’s assassination, he believes Kirk's remarks about Black people and his opposition to affirmative action, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives merit scrutiny.The West Palm Beach NAACP voiced their support for Ferguson in a statement: \"This is truly a tragedy for all involved; no one deserves to be murdered. We find all murders inexcusable. With that being said, a person's record, deceased or alive, speaks for itself. If you were a racist before you died, why would you be considered anything other than that after death? The means by which you die do not change who you are, what you represent, or the things you did while you lived. All that I know leads me to say Charlie Kirk was a racist.\" - Alfred Fields, West Palm Beach NAACP. Some have questioned Ferguson’s assertions about Kirk, particularly noting that he admitted he was unaware of Kirk prior to his assassination.When Lopez inquired if Ferguson had enough time to evaluate Kirk's message, Ferguson replied with the following:\"Yes. If I look at five videos, and in those five videos you say things that seem to be biased to the point of being a racist or bigoted how many more videos do I need to see before I make a conclusion? If you're trying to elevate all people, no one can say Mr. Kirk did that and that's what I was getting at.\"Guardiola countered Ferguson’s claims, arguing that Kirk's stance on DEI and affirmative action was not racist.\"It's a merit system,\" he stated, adding that while Kirk didn't make too many appearances at Black colleges and universities, he welcomed discussions from people with all perspectives. \"He wanted the younger 18, 19-year-olds to have their own minds and say, 'Speak for yourself and talk and speak the truth.'\"When asked what message he would send to Ferguson, Guardiola encouraged him to \"go back and watch Charlie Kirk and learn about him. I believe in free speech but when you're talking about hate speech without knowing the background, you can't be doing that.\"However, Ferguson stood firm in his position.\"Anybody who wants to have an honest dialogue then have an honest dialogue, but I won't be bullied by anyone as far as that goes,\" he said. \"I'm going to always advocate for our children here. I'm definitely not stepping down.\"WPTV has reached out to the Florida Department of Education and the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis for further comments, and we await their response. ; }).then();",

By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Federal prosecutors are nearing the end of their case in the Ryan Routh trial.The jury on Thursday heard more information about makeshift guns prosecutors said Routh left in North Carolina before he traveled to Florida.WATCH BELOW: Sniper testifies Ryan Routh used military-style tactics Sniper testifies Ryan Routh used military-style tactics The weapons were found in a box that prosecutors said Routh left at a former employee's house months before the assassination attempt near President Donald Trump's golf course near West Palm Beach.On the stand, an ATF agent said investigators found in North Carolina various equipment that can be purchased at hardware stores like pipes, springs and clamps assembled into what it called make-shift firing mechanisms.Some of the seven different objects had space to hold a .50 caliber bullet.Prosecutors told the judge they found a manual about explosive devices in a trailer connected to Routh. However, they weren't allowed to introduce it to the jury because it wasn't related to the alleged assassination attempt.Prosecutors argued these attempts at creating a makeshift gun months before his arrest showed Routh's intent to commit violence months before his arrest.The jury on Thursday heard from a former sniper. He served as an expert witness for the prosecution to show Routh had the intent to create violence at Trump International Golf Club.The sniper said Routh's decisions are similar to the training techniques he learned in the military.This included going on operations at night, hiding in the bushes, using a scope, using a fence to help aim a weapon. The sniper testified that Routh's selection of Trump's golf course to conduct a shooting was similar to predicting movements for a target.Prosecutors also showed a list that included a green poncho, bug spray and diapers — all objects the sniper said are useful when hiding.Routh is representing himself in the trial.Routh's federal charges include:Attempted assassination of a major presidential candidatePossessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violenceAssaulting a federal officerFelon in possession of a firearm and ammunitionPossession of a firearm with an obliterated serial numberThe trial is expected to run for two or three weeks.Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch fuse.More of WPTV's coverage of Trump assassination attempt below: Fort Pierce Witnesses place Routh in PBC days before alleged assassination attempt Ethan Stein Fort Pierce FBI details digital trail in trial of man accused of trying to kill Trump Ethan Stein Fort Pierce Witnesses detail 'sniper's nest' in trial of man accused of trying to kill Trump Ethan Stein Fort Pierce Trump assassination attempt suspect forfeits opening statement at trial David Fischer Fort Pierce Jury selected for man charged with trying to kill Trump Ethan Stein Fort Pierce Ryan Routh Trial: Jury pool shrinks as screening continues David Fischer Region Martin County 'This was our moment of truth:' MCSO recounts arrest of Ryan Routh Tyler Hatfield National News Jury selection begins in the trial over alleged Trump assassination plot Scripps News Group Fort Pierce Final preps for trial of man accused of attempting to assassinate Trump David Fischer Trump Suspect in Trump attempted assassination will be allowed to represent self Ethan Stein Trump Man accused of Trump assassination attempt wants to represent himself Associated Press WPTV Investigates Suspect in Trump case won't use insanity defense, attorneys say Dave Bohman Trump Judge: Expert can check rifle's operability in Trump assassination attempt Associated Press State Florida AG files state charges against Routh after DOJ drops objections Dave Bohman Trump This is how Martin County deputies took down Trump suspect Todd Wilson Trump Deputies who apprehended suspect meet Trump at Mar-a-Lago Scott Sutton Trump Suspect in Trump apparent assassination faces these charges Dave Bohman Trump What we know about suspect in Trump assassination attempt Adriana Gomez Licon Trump Residents who live near Trump golf club saying this after assassination attempt Zitlali Solache Trump 'Shocked and saddened': Democratic leaders weigh-in on assassination attempt Joel Lopez National Politics Trump: Law enforcement was 'absolutely outstanding' responding to gunman Justin Boggs Trump 'See something, say something': Woman says she saw suspect's SUV surrounded Aja Dorsainvil Trump Suspect in custody after apparent attempted assassination of Trump Samantha Roesler ; }).then();",

The agency has refused to provide any clarity despite weeks of our emails seeking answers.But in a podcast over the weekend, controversial Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, a vocal critic of the COVID-19 vaccine, announced his hope to shut it down in Florida. “The MRNA, the goal for that is not to be available to anyone because no one should be using that one,” he said during the podcast.Despite all the uncertainty, some Floridians have been successful in getting the shot.“I feel lucky,” said Mark Lebow of Port Charlotte. Lebow is over 65 years old and has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He recently got the booster at a CVS in Venice but had to wait until he had a prescription from his doctor.“I think she wanted the prescription just because she's afraid of corporate backlash, or something like that,” he said.A vaccine that was once encouraged and available to all, now up in the air and fueling some concerns in Florida that it will become out of reach. ; }).then();",
