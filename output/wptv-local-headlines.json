By: Michael Hoffman Posted VERO BEACH, Fla. — Florida is no stranger to crazy headlines — and we’re following a pretty wild story out of Indian River County.Sheriff Eric Flowers tells WPTV they arrested Brandon Harnois for using his backyard as a shooting range. The neighborhood is called Westfield, off 16th Street in Vero Beach. It's near homes and even a youth church camp — and luckily, no one was hurt. A deputy was on patrol Sunday night and just happened to be passing by when he saw tracer rounds fired out of an AR-15-style rifle — they look like fireworks — flying right over busy 16th Street. \"The idea that somebody is shooting in their backyard here is not normal. This is not normal behavior. This is something that's very, very concerning to us,\" said Sheriff Flowers. FPL says it’s going to cost thousands to replace a nearby utility pole hit by the gunfire. There was also reported bullet damage to cabins at the youth camp across the street.The SWAT team was called out and arrested the man at gunpoint. Once they knocked the door down, investigators found a lot of weapons: guns, ammo, a ghost gun, illegal suppressors made from oil cans, a hand grenade and even a few live and unregistered cobras.Now the ATF and FWC are involved in the investigation — the sheriff says the man wasn’t even supposed to have guns in the first place. \"He was not supposed to have any weapons. He was arrested back in January for a charge of that, so it's clear that he knew he was not allowed to have weapons. And the volume of weapons and types that he had, really disturbing for somebody who knew they weren't supposed to have those,\" said Sheriff Flowers. At a press conference Thursday, the sheriff said Harnois is facing the following charges: Shooting deadly missiles into dwellings, vehicles, buildings, or aircraftFiring projectile across private landFiring weapon in public or on residential propertyViolation of domestic violence injunctionResisting an officer without violenceThe sheriff said during the press conference that two more search warrants were issued for Harnois' business and storage units. They recovered more weapons and body armor. They expect more charges to come, including state and federal charges. It's still an active investigation.",

By: Zitlali Solache , Audra Schroeder Posted and last updated INDIAN RIVER COUNTY, Fla. — An 86-year-old man who had been missing for nearly four days was rescued less than a mile from an RV park in Sebastian. The Indian River County Sheriff's Office (IRCSO) said Thursday that Donald Keaton, who has dementia, had last been seen on Sunday. He was found at around 10:30 p.m. on Wednesday, in a wooded trail area, under mud and a patch of palms. WATCH: Drones flew for 26 hours before Keaton was found 86-year-old man with dementia rescued after going missing for nearly 4 days Keaton was found with scratches, cuts and ant bites, and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. His wife, Joyce Keaton, said he is expected to recover and be discharged on Friday. “I just want to thank all of you for bringing my husband back home,\" said Joyce. “When you have the faith in God that gives you the peace, and then you see all these people working together, makes all the difference.”Joyce explained they were staying at the RV park. Donald went for a walk and wandered into the woods for 81 hours. WPTV The Keatons were staying at an RV park when Donald told his wife he was going for a walk. “He wouldn’t get out of a hole that’s why he was breaking the palms. He was trying to put them underneath him so he could lift himself out,\" said Joyce. He said 'I tried, I just couldn’t get out the hole.'” The sheriff's office says the rescue was a multi-agency effort, with assistance from Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Brevard County Sheriff's Office and the Sebastian and Fellsmere police departments. “He was hidden under those palms,\" said Sheriff Eric Flowers. \"We had been out with the dogs. We had been out with ATVs, the helicopters, and these guys went over 26 hours of drone time.” IRCSO spent several hours flying drones and deploying K-9s.

By: Kate Payne Posted and last updated In the summer of 2021, when the delta variant of COVID-19 was filling hospitals throughout the country, U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick was conspiring to steal $5 million in federal disaster funds that were meant to slow the spread of the pandemic, prosecutors allege.The Florida Democrat has been charged with 15 federal counts, accusing her of stealing funds that had been mistakenly overpaid to the health care company owned by her family. Within two months of receiving the funds, more than $100,000 had been spent to buy the congresswoman a 3-carat yellow diamond ring, prosecutors alleged in a recently released federal indictment.WATCH BELOW: Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick charged with 15 federal counts Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick charged with 15 federal counts Cherfilus-McCormick's brother, former chief of staff and accountant were also charged in the alleged scheme. As of Thursday, no attorneys were listed for the codefendants.Federal prosecutors accused the congresswoman of stealing Federal Emergency Management Agency overpayments that her family health care company received through a COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract. Cherfilus-McCormick has denied the charges and has no plans to resign, according to a statement shared by her chief of staff.\"This is an unjust, baseless, sham indictment — and I am innocent. The timing alone is curious and clearly meant to distract from far more pressing national issues,\" Cherfilus-McCormick's statement reads in part. \"I look forward to my day in court. Until then, I will continue fighting for my constituents.\"Here's what to know: What's in the indictment? The indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Miami on Wednesday accuses Cherfilus-McCormick and several co-defendants of conspiring to steal $5 million in overpayments to her family's health care company, Trinity Healthcare Services, under a 2021 contract to register people for COVID-19 vaccinations.Prosecutors say the funds were distributed to various accounts, including to friends and relatives who in turn donated to the campaign that got her elected to Congress. A \"substantial portion\" of the misappropriated funds were used for the campaign or for the \"personal benefit\" of Cherfilus-McCormick and others accused, prosecutors claim.Cherfilus-McCormick has been charged with theft of government funds; making and receiving straw donor contributions; aiding and assisting a false and fraudulent statement on a tax return; and money laundering, as well as conspiracy charges associated with each of those counts.Read the full 42-page indictment below: How has she responded? Cherfilus-McCormick maintains her innocence.

We will fight to clear her good name,\" wrote her attorneys David Oscar Markus, Margot Moss and Melissa Madrigal.Cherfilus-McCormick won a special election in January 2022 to represent Florida's 20th District in parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties after Rep. Alcee Hastings died in 2021. What about her seat in Congress? While Cherfilus-McCormick intends to continue representing her South Florida district, she is stepping down from her position as ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced Thursday.\"Consistent with the United States Constitution, she is entitled to her day in court and the presumption of innocence,\" Jeffries said in a statement, adding that the move to step down is in line with the rules of the House Democratic Caucus.U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, a Republican who represents parts of Sarasota and Charlotte Counties in southwest Florida, called Thursday for her resignation. If the congresswoman doesn't resign, Steube said he'd bring a resolution to the floor to expel her.\"Defrauding the federal government and disaster victims of $5 million is an automatic disqualifier from serving in elected office,\" Steube posted on X.The last member of Congress to be expelled was scandal-plagued Rep. George Santos of New York. Santos had not yet been convicted of federal charges, and House Speaker Mike Johnson voted against it at the time, expressing concern about setting a precedent of expelling members based on untried allegations.WATCH BELOW: Cherfilus-McCormick indicted on charges of stealing $5M in disaster funds Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick indicted on charges of stealing $5M in disaster funds What did previous investigations find?

Cherfilus-McCormick was the CEO of Trinity at the time.The House Ethics Committee unanimously voted in July to reauthorize an investigative subcommittee to examine the allegations involving the congresswoman.The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a January report that Cherfilus-McCormick's income in 2021 was more than $6 million higher than in 2020, driven by nearly $5.75 million in consulting and profit-sharing fees received from Trinity Healthcare Services.The indictment charges Cherfilus-McCormick and her 2021 tax preparer with conspiring to file a false federal tax return by falsely claiming political spending and other personal expenses as business deductions and inflated charitable contributions.Read more of our previous coverage below: Politics Rep.

    "headline": "'CHAOS': Judges clash over Citizens Insurance arbitration process",
    "content": "NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates Judges clash over Citizens Insurance arbitration process as homeowners caught in legal limbo A new court ruling could push more than 400 homeowner disputes back into arbitration — a process decided by a single judge instead of a courtroom. Kate Hussey, WPTV News Two Florida judges can't agree on Citizens Insurance's arbitration process — leaving hundreds of homeowners in legal limbo. By: Kate Hussey Posted VERO BEACH, Fla. — A legal battle over Citizens Property Insurance's controversial arbitration clause has intensified, with two Florida judges issuing conflicting rulings that leave hundreds of homeowners uncertain about their path to justice.The dispute centers on Citizens' mandatory arbitration process, which forces policyholders out of traditional courts and into private proceedings decided by a single judge. WATCH: New ruling could push more than 400 homeowner disputes back into arbitration Judges clash over Citizens Insurance arbitration process A WPTV investigation revealed that Citizens funds the salaries of judges deciding its own cases. Of the 11% of arbitration cases that went to a final hearing, our WPTV analysis found judges sided with Citizens in 53 out of the 54 cases last year — 99%. In August, Hillsborough County Judge Melissa Polo halted all arbitrations, questioning whether the system violates constitutional due process rights. But Leon County judge Jonathan Sjostrom Friday ordered arbitrations to resume, ruling that one Hillsborough case shouldn't stop other homeowners' proceedings. \"Now there's just chaos, no one knows what's right, what's wrong,\" said Joey Padilla, an attorney representing Citizens policyholders in Delray Beach. The conflicting orders have now created a situation where two circuit court judges of equal authority have issued opposing rulings. \"This isn't something that I usually see very often,\" said Padilla. \"It's one trial court judge telling another trial court judge that their order doesn't matter — and that my order matters,\" Padilla said.Attorney Meredith Truen, who represents Gloria and Jason Nitch in Vero Beach after Citizens denied their Hurricane Milton claim, said the Leon County ruling adds confusion rather than clarity.\"What's confusing — they didn't say that that process is constitutional,\" said Truen, \"They said that, 'We're unsure of that, but in the meantime, keep going through that process anyway.'\" The Leon County ruling affects more than 400 disputes that were previously on hold, according to Citizens spokesperson Michael Peltier. Peltier said the state-run insurer remains committed to arbitration, calling it \"fair, transparent, and faster than state courts.\" He added only about 1% of the 125,000 claims have been submitted to Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH) arbitration, meaning 99% of claims are resolved without DOAH arbitration.However, the legal uncertainty continues as the appeals court — a higher authority — is still deciding whether Judge Polo was correct to question the system's constitutionality. If the appeals court agrees with her, the Leon County order allowing arbitrations to continue could be completely negated. \"It'll definitely be a mess. We're going to have to backtrack and refile and challenge those decisions,\" Truen said.The chaos has left attorneys questioning whether to take on new Citizens cases.PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Citizens Insurance judges funded by insurer they rule on, court records show Citizens Insurance judges funded by insurer they rule on, court records show \"I'm really considering not taking too many of these Citizens cases in the future. Until this is decided, because the chaos is not worth the effort that you have to put forth,\" Padilla said.For homeowners like the Nitches, who hoped for the possibility of a jury trial, the prospect of being pushed back into arbitration is particularly frustrating.\"They're definitely upset by it,\" Truen said of her clients. Peltier said Citizens will also proceed with the few cases (a dozen or so) in which a judge has specifically ordered the disputes to move forward. Citizens' attorneys have already begun filing the Leon County ruling in pending cases, including in Padilla and Truen's cases, potentially moving arbitration proceedings forward while the legal battle continues at the appellate level.

The biggest revision reduces the amount of public land used from 31 acres to 7.72 acres. Under the new proposal, all land west of Northwest Second Avenue, including Memorial Park, would remain publicly owned. Private development would be limited to the east side near the Brightline station.According to the updated plan, the privately developed section would include 947 residential units, 85,098 square feet of retail space, 120,000 square feet of offices and a hotel with 180 rooms. The hotel, which had been removed in earlier plans, is now back in the project. Developers said the plan also enhances Memorial Park and expands park amenities.Still, many residents said the changes fall short. “They’re just pushing all the high rises across the street,” Boca Raton resident Adam Dearborn said. “They took away the hotel and now it's back. They’re just moving stuff around.” Boca Raton 2nd lawsuit seeks to stop this government redevelopment project Ange Toussaint Traffic and construction impacts remain a dominant concern. “Second Avenue can’t bear that amount of traffic. The construction will be unbearable. The traffic will be unbearable once it’s built,” Dearborn said.Developers argue the updated plan provides major financial benefits to the city. According to the project’s financial model, Boca Raton would receive lease payments tied to rental income over a 99-year term. New city property tax revenue from the private improvements is estimated at $83.5 million in today’s dollars, with another $52.6 million generated for the Community Redevelopment Agency.WATCH BELOW: Third version of Boca Raton downtown campus project revealed Third version of Boca Raton downtown campus project revealed, residents weigh in Developers said the city could see more than $2 billion over the course of the lease, along with new public facilities including a new city hall, a community center, and improvements to Memorial Park.But the changes still aren’t enough to sway many residents who remain firmly opposed.\"We don’t need it, we have enough money to do it ourselves. We don’t have to sell out to a developer for 99 years,” Dearborn said. “I’ll vote it down.”City commissioners are expected to vote on the master plan in January. If approved, the project would then go before voters in March.Read more of WPTV's related coverage below: Boca Raton 'Misleading': Resident wants injunction to stop Save Boca ballot measure Ange Toussaint Real Estate News Boca Raton redevelopment moves forward, but residents have these concerns Zitlali Solache Boca Raton Interim master plan for Boca Government Campus unveiled, concerns still remain Zitlali Solache Boca Raton City leaders move forward with 'reimagining' of new city hall, downtown Zitlali Solache",

    "content": "NewsEducation 'NOT ENOUGH': Palm Beach County teachers demand higher pay as contracts stall Crowds rallied outside the school district headquarters Wednesday Khalil Mclean, WPTV Teachers argued that in an A-rated district, they deserve compensation that reflects their performance. By: Zitlali Solache Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Palm Beach County school district teachers are demanding higher wages after contract negotiations with the school district reached an impasse earlier this month.Crowds rallied outside the school district headquarters on Wednesday, then packed the school board meeting to voice their concerns about the raises.WATCH BELOW: Palm Beach County teachers rally for salary increases Palm Beach County teachers rally for salary increases \"My plea is that you reconsider your priorities and demonstrate through your actions and not just your words that you value the people doing the work that keeps this district running,\" said Michelle Buckel, a teacher at Jupiter Elementary.Several teachers are pushing for a 5% salary increase. Earlier this month, the school district proposed a 1.8% raise along with a 1.5% bonus, but members of the teachers' union say that still falls short.\"The most important factor in a classroom in schools, for getting students to reach their potential, is a highly effective teacher,\" said Gordan Longhofer, president of Palm Beach County Classroom Teachers Association (CTA).Teachers at the rally said that inflation and rising costs are making it harder to stay afloat.\"It means to be able to live and pay your bills without having to choose between your prescription meds or your light bill,\" said Jacqueline Major, a high school English teacher at Rise Academy. \"Your cable bill, or your car insurance. It means that we're worth it.\"According to the National Education Association, Florida is 50th in a ranking of average teacher pay across the country.\"Even with the referendum, our wages are not enough for a single person to live in this county,\" said Jodi Mochel. \"Most of my colleagues aren’t here today because they’re at their second or third job.”Crowds argued that in an A-rated district, they deserve compensation that reflects their performance and warned that stagnant pay could drive teachers away.\"This is our future. The kids are our future,\" said Cheryl Whitehurst, a physical education teacher. \"We are A-rated teachers in an A-rated district. We need to be treated that way.\"The school district issued the following statement due to the impasse: “The School District of Palm Beach County supports increased compensation for teachers, and we recognize that the success of our students is a direct result of our dedicated educators. The School District has worked diligently to construct a compensation package that exceeds the state’s allocation. The District’s current salary proposal offers five times the amount specifically funded by the state for teacher raises. We achieved this despite significant financial headwinds.The District is currently managing a $40 million budget shortfall. This gap is the result of a decline in enrollment of approximately 6,000 students. We must balance our budget responsibly, and we’re working to avoid layoffs and cuts to student programs. We remain committed to providing the highest possible raises within these financial constraints.The District has a strong history of providing higher raises when state funding allows, including a 10% package just a couple of years ago when the budget was more favorable. Our teacher salaries and benefits remain among the most competitive in the state, and we agree that more must be done by the state to increase teacher pay.Our goal is to reach a fiscally responsible agreement as soon as possible so our teachers receive their pay increases without further delay. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of our teachers and every member of Team Palm Beach.” Chief of Communications Sean Cooley A hearing with a special magistrate has not yet been scheduled. While there is no firm deadline, the review process could take months.",
