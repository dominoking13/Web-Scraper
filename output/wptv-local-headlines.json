During Thursday’s special meeting, town council members voted unanimously to approve an ordinance aimed at creating safer parks. WATCH: Jupiter town leaders approve ordinance to restrict e-bikes in parks Town leaders vote for ordinance to restrict e-bikes in parks For resident Felix Lugo, the new rules also mean safer streets.“I see like they go very extremely fast,” said Lugo. “If they’re going extremely fast then you know, accidents can very much happen.”The new updated rules come after 30 years, and have been in the works since January 2025. The changes would allow e-bikes only on park roadways, away from park fields. Residents like Lugo remember the deadly e-bike crash from earlier this year that took the life of a teen and still weighs heavy on the Jupiter community.Town leaders hint these changes are part of a broader effort.“A couple of bills this legislative session are going to address e-bikes,” said Malise Sundstrom. “I’d love to understand what’s going forward and the discussion around it.”Jupiter police said they have continued educating riders on safety tips and will continue to do so, ahead of holiday season.Other sections of the ordinance prohibit drones, fireworks, and alcohol with a special permit in town parks. It also includes regulating noise and established parking and driving regulations.",

The Citizens’ Committee on Airport Noise hosted the meeting, giving people a chance to voice their frustrations over what they call constant disruption from low-flying planes.“It’s what some call the ‘Palm Beach Pause,’” one resident said — referring to the loud engines that interrupt conversations and outdoor activities. “We can’t be outside anymore during flyovers,” said Rafael Clemente. “You can’t hear the TV. You can’t hear a conversation.” Trump Palm Beach fights federal no-fly zone over Mar-a-Lago Kayla McDermott When Trump is in town, the FAA and Secret Service traditionally impose a Temporary Flight Restriction — or TFR — to keep air traffic away from Mar-a-Lago for security reasons. But now, that restriction has become permanent, even when the former president is not here.Planes are being diverted over neighborhoods filled with older homes, and residents say it’s not just about noise — it’s also about safety and quality of life.“They are very low,” one person said during public comment. “I can almost recognize people in the airplanes looking out the windows. They may be waving, but I’m doing something else. There’s a lot of soot that comes off of those planes, and our white roof that was white is now gray.” WPTV Dozens of residents packed a meeting Thursday night at Palm Beach International Airport, demanding answers about the new restrictions. Others say the age and structure of their homes make the noise especially unbearable. “Our homes are also 100 years old,” one resident said. “They are not hardened. We have jalousie windows. We have mission tile. Our homes are not prepared for the impact of the sounds that we are receiving.”Residents had hoped to share their concerns directly with officials from the FAA and the Secret Service — the two agencies that recommend and enforce the restrictions. However, because of the federal shutdown, no representatives from either agency attended the meeting. WPTV Investigates Air traffic noise: Why it could be worse during Trump's 2nd term Dave Bohman Palm Beach County Commissioner Greg Weiss, who lives in one of the affected neighborhoods in Flamingo Park, addressed the crowd and promised to push for answers.“The first thing is, we need to get an explanation as to what’s going on and why,” Weiss said. “Just to let you know, between us, the town, our Congress folks — we are going to get to the bottom of this. You have our commitment on that.”The Citizens’ Committee on Airport Noise said it plans to take residents’ concerns to airport staff, then to the county commission — and ultimately push the issue all the way to the White House.",

By: Meghan McRoberts Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — As Breast Cancer Awareness Month comes to a close, one clear takeaway is that research—both big and small—is making a real difference in the daily lives of those battling the disease. Some of that innovation is happening right here at home.WATCH: Device helps radiologists see where to target radiation Local doctor using new device to improve breast cancer treatment A local team of medical professionals has created a device that’s now being implanted in breast cancer patients across the country. It’s called Accusyte—a small piece of metal inside a suture. Dr. Andrew Shapiro is the medical director of the breast program at Wellington Regional Medical Center and a surgeon with Advanced Surgical Physicians in Wellington. He says he’s implanted several dozen of the devices during tumor removal surgeries for women who plan to go through radiation treatments. Accusyte helps radiologists see exactly where to target radiation, allowing for more accurate treatment and fewer harmful side effects.“Radiation is certainly not without certain things that can happen, side effects, right? Women can have skin changes, either thickening of the skin, pigmentation changes, redness, different types of visible changes,” Dr. Shapiro explained. “It’s definitely important to pinpoint that radiation so that surrounding tissues are spared of any unnecessary exposure.” Breast Cancer Promising breast cancer vaccine could be available by 2030, researchers say Meghan McRoberts Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the U.S. and the second most deadly. Dr. Shapiro says he is seeing more breast cancer patients—but that could also be due to increased screening and awareness.“It provides a tremendous opportunity for patients to be treated most effectively and more targeted and minimize that question of are we delivering radiation to the right area.”The new technology gives doctors a clearer picture and patients more peace of mind, and Dr. Shaprio says, another example of how innovation in medicine continues to move treatment forward.",

James Bailery, WPTV News Boca Raton business owner, Kim Grzech, expresses concern about boom of businesses migrating from New York to Florida. By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated BOCA RATON, Fla. — Following WPTV’s reporting on the so-called “Mamdani Migration” — New York City businesses leaving the city after the mayoral election — new data we obtained shows several companies filing to relocate to Florida.WATCH BELOW: 'That’s always a concern. Rent is a really big deal for a business,' Kim Grzech tells WPTV WPTV uncovers wave of NYC businesses heading to Florida Mamdani, who was elected as New York City mayor Tuesday, has pledged to increase taxes for corporations and individuals making more than $1 million, a move that sent shock waves through the business community. The morning after Mamdani's election victory, Florida business relocation attorney, Chad Cummings, told WPTV he received five to ten times his usual number of calls from New York companies seeking to move to Florida.\"My phone, and I'm not exaggerating, has literally been ringing off the hook. I have not been able to leave my desk since about 7:30 this morning,\" Cummings said. \"What we are seeing is really unprecedented.\" Cummings said Wednesday alone he spoke with nine companies targeting Palm Beach County and three others eyeing Port St. Lucie.\"They are very candid, for the most part, that this is a decision that is driven by the election results in Manhattan and a desire to escape what they perceive to be an oppressive regulatory and tax regime,\" Cummings said. WPTV dug through Florida's corporate filings, and found that in just the past few days, at least 27 New York companies filed to expand operations in Florida, while nine more filed to relocate entirely.Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer confirmed to our Joel Lopez Tuesday that four corporate headquarters are already planning moves to his city, with many more companies reaching out since the election.When asked how many businesses have expressed interest in coming to Boca Raton, Singer told WPTV there are \"too many to count.\"\"And we can expect more calls,\" said Singer. \"We've continued our strategic and targeted marketing to businesses, because this effort is about bringing businesses to Boca Raton.\" Mike Simas, president of Florida's Council of 100, welcomed the new businesses in a press release Wednesday. \"The people we really want to attract to market to continue to drive that high wage job growth,\" he told WPTV. Local businesses brace for impact The influx presents both opportunities and challenges for existing Florida businesses. Kim Grzech, who has owned Boca Print Shop since 1995, sees potential for more printing jobs but worries about increased competition and rising costs, particularly in rent increases. \"Are you worried about getting priced out of your place here?\" asked WPTV's Kate Hussey. \"That’s always a concern,\" replied Grzech. \"Rent is a really big deal for a business.\" In an interview with WPTV Wednesday, CEO Talbot Sutter said he's already seeing a surge in real estate interest in Palm Beach County coming from New York, and warned of potential prices increases. \"In my 30 years, I've seen a lot of businesses come and go. It's been harder and harder for smaller businesses to compete,\" said Grzech. Cities prepare for growth Singer said Boca Raton's strategy focuses on attracting the right-sized companies for the city.\"Our targets have largely been companies that are the right size for Boca — the financial sector, and if you move a corporate headquarters here, you may get high paying jobs without all the people,\" Singer said.The mayor noted that Boca already has a high inventory of office space available for rent.In St. Lucie County, Economic Development Director Pete Tesch told WPTV he hasn't seen any direct influx in interested businesses because of the election, but explained that indirect effects are likely. He said the county has experienced significant industrial growth, with over 16 million square feet of industrial space largely occupied by Fortune 100 and 500 companies. Institutional investors and banking activity in the region often translate into property acquisitions, which could have downstream effects on St. Lucie County’s economy.\"This is a continuing trend,\" said Tesch. \"You're starting to see even more investment bankers, hedge fund managers come from New York City. We’ll probably continue to see the impacts over the next few years.\" Simas said Florida has formed a committee to address growing pains associated with the business influx, including affordable housing, traffic and transit issues.\"We're focused not just on the opportunity. We're also squarely focused on the challenges that the state faces right now,\" Simas said.For business owners like Grzech, the hope is that existing companies will be included in future planning.\"I'm hoping we'll be part of that plan — because it's a big concern,\" Grzechsaid.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

But most importantly, it's hers again.WATCH BELOW: Woman gets her stolen land back after year-long legal battle Woman gets her stolen land back after year-long legal battle \"I'm just happy to have my lot back,\" McCurdy said.The property was stolen in June 2024 when Port St. Lucie police say Rosalie Lawrence, who previously had the last name McCurdy, was contacted by an acquisition company and sold the land she never legally owned.According to a police report, the acquisition company then sold the property to Texas-based D.R. Horton Homes.McCurdy, the rightful owner, only discovered the fraudulent sale when she went to pay her property taxes.After a year-long legal saga and thousands of dollars in legal fees, McCurdy finally got her land back when a St. Lucie County judge awarded her the title last week.\"It's like I'm buying my lot back, which was like mine to begin with in the first place.

Of that group of beneficiaries, more than 20 shared their Medicare statements and explanations of benefits with WPTV Chief Investigator Jamie Ostroff. The documents accounted for nearly $400,000, billed by Sunshine Senior Solutions.In the statements reviewed by WPTV, Medicare did not pay the full amount that was billed. The majority of the beneficiaries said their gap insurance did not pay Sunshine Senior Solutions and flagged the bills as possible fraud.During an interview about Medicare open enrollment, Ostroff brought these concerns directly to Dr. Oz, who expressed frustration about the lengthy investigation process and offered to personally come to South Florida to address the issue.\"Jamie, I love you. I can tell you right now. God bless you for first of all, raising it to my level of intention, but also pursuing this. It frustrates me as well,\" Oz said. \"I'd like to know, if you don't mind more details about this company, because I will personally come down there with you and address this.\"After reviewing the mysterious bills from Sunshine Senior Solutions for catheters and durable medical equipment that was never requested or delivered, many of the Medicare recipients said they reported the activity to Medicare's fraud hotline.\"I was kind of shocked. I thought that they could put the clamps on this and shut these people down, but evidently it takes time to investigate,\" said Marty Rowe, a Medicare recipient living in suburban Cleveland, who received the unexpected statements.Peggy Foley spoke with Ostroff with a group of her pickleball friends from suburban Chicago, who also received statements from Sunshine Senior Solution. They also said they contacted Medicare's fraud hotline. \"And they said, 'We are aware of this. We're investigating,'\" Foley said.Jim Dente, of northwest New Jersey, received similar information when he called. \"I've been told they're under investigation. But that's the extent of what I've heard,\" Dente said.Dr. Oz expressed frustration with the current system that focuses on identifying and prosecuting fraudsters rather than immediately stopping fraudulent payments.\"So, what would happen is, you get a lead like the one you're giving, and the Justice Department would work very painstakingly through the legal system over several years to figure out who these guys are, and then they'd get ready to clamp down on them. They'd shut the business down,\" Oz said. \"But in the meantime, there were several billion dollars lost. So, we don't want that anymore. I am more interested in the money than the criminal.\"Oz said his priority is stopping fraudulent payments immediately rather than waiting for lengthy criminal investigations to conclude.\"I want the money stopped. Go after the criminal, if you want, but don't let the American taxpayer be taken advantage of, while the legal system works its ways,\" Oz said.According to Medicare, the agency can suspend payments to a provider if there are credible allegations of fraud against that provider. Medicare won't comment on whether that's the case for Sunshine Senior Solutions, citing concerns that it could compromise an investigation.No one at Sunshine Senior Solutions has been charged with a crime. Federal authorities including Medicare won't confirm or deny the existence of an investigation.Medicare's medical equipment provider database no longer lists Sunshine Senior Solutions. Providers that receive reimbursement from Medicare are required to obtain an accreditation and enroll with the agency. The company was listed in the database earier this year.When Ostroff visited the company's office suite in Delray Beach earlier this year, the person who answered the door didn't answer questions, wouldn't identify who was in charge, and said she didn't know what durable medical equipment was. The person told Ostroff to call the phone number taped to the door, which matches the number on the company's website.Repeated calls to Sunshine Senior Solutions continue to go unanswered.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

We hope this event can offer some desperately needed immediate relief.\" Palm Beach County Food Bank A drive-through food distribution event will be held at John Prince Park on Nov. 7, 2025 The agency said volunteers are needed to load cars and direct traffic on the day of the event. To donate time for the food drive, visit pbcfoodbank.org/volunteer. For a list of partnering agencies of the PBCFB who are also distributing food, visit pbcfoodbank.org/find-food.\"The face of hunger has changed in recent years,\" continued Kendall. \"One in eight people often don't know where their next meal will come from. Many more working families and multi-generational families are struggling to put food on the table as housing costs and other costs of living increase in this market. Thanks to our buying power, we are able to transform every dollar donated into five meals for children, seniors, families, and neighbors in need experiencing food insecurity. If people are looking for ways to help their hungry neighbors, donations of all sizes are critical. Every dollar and every pound of food that is donated stays here in Palm Beach County. We are the only Food Bank focused solely on helping Palm Beach County residents.\"The Palm Beach County Food Bank said there are 192,000 food-insecure residents throughout the county.Click here for more information about Friday's event, food resources, volunteer opportunities or to donate.",
