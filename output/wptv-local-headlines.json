LUCIE, Fla. — A 27-year veteran of the Port St. Lucie Police Department remains in critical condition after being shot in the face Monday night, and doctors say he will soon need to be transferred for a highly specialized surgery.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Police release body-camera video after Port St. Lucie shootout Police say Sgt. Erik Levasseur has undergone a second surgery to repair facial injuries, has a wired jaw, and now relies on a tracheotomy. He remains in a medically induced coma. Doctors have confirmed shrapnel in his retina, requiring a special team of expert surgeons, and preparations are underway to transfer him to a specialized hospital.Port St. Lucie Police Headquarters, usually illuminated in blue light, carries a deeper meaning tonight as the department continues to support one of its own who is “still fighting the good fight.”On Monday night, Sgt. Levasseur and five other officers responded to a neighbor dispute in a gated Tradition neighborhood. They were met by gunfire.Body-worn camera video captured officers calling out to Levasseur after he was struck.Police say Sgt. Levasseur was shot twice in the face by an AK-style rifle.Joe Edge, who has known Sgt. Levasseur for decades — even doing his taxes — says his family’s connection to Levasseur runs deep. Edge’s wife is a former Port St. Lucie officer who served with him.“I've known Eric better part of 25 years,” Edge said. “It's no surprise that he was probably the first one there, so he's just, just all around good guy.”Edge reflected on a 2012 photo of Sgt. Levasseur wearing a shirt honoring their mutual friend, Tommy Worthington, a St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office deputy who died from an autoimmune disease in 2012.“He and Eric were very close,” Edge said.Now, Edge says Levasseur needs the same support he once showed others.“Just say prayers. You know, it's, it's just say a lot of prayers,” he said. “It's going to be a long years of him getting better, but he'll look back at this and be thankful for the support that he's getting.”",

LUCIE, Fla. — Police have released body camera footage from the officer-involved shooting that left a suspect dead and a longtime Port St. Lucie sergeant critically injured.The shooting happened shortly after 6 p.m. Monday in the 11000 block of SW Lake Park Drive, where six officers responded to a call involving 32-year-old Frankie Salvatore Riccio. According to police, Riccio’s mother had reported concerns about his behavior, saying he had been abusing marijuana for the last 24 hours and had armed himself with a hunting rifle prior to the encounter.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Police release body-camera video after Port St. Lucie shootout Body camera footage captures multiple gunshots as officers approached the home in the Tradition neighborhood.

Fire was returned. Suspect was deceased at that scene as a result,” Port St. Lucie Police Chief Leo Niemczyk said.The video shows officers returning fire and moving toward Riccio, who died from his injuries.

Her husband, Jack Hohman, added, “You know, they're just doing their job, protecting, you know, the citizens. And it's a shame that this is going on like this.”LeVasseur was transported to HCA Florida Lawnwood Medical Center, where he remains in critical condition. “His prognosis at this time, we're very hopeful that he'll make a recovery. He's got some complications that he's got to manage and deal with,” Niemczyk said.The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting, and police say details leading up to the gunfire are still being reviewed.

Officer-involved shootings have increased in Florida, data shows This figure includes deaths not caused by assaults (vehicle crashes are a leading cause of law enforcement deaths).However, WPTV's analysis of data from the Gun Violence Archive tells a different story when focusing specifically on incidents where law enforcement officers were either injured or killed by gunfire.The number of incidents nationwide in which an officer was shot held steady between 2024 and 2025.

    "headline": "Why this Fort Pierce school got taxpayer money after it closed",
    "content": "NewsEducation Fort Pierce private school received taxpayer money after it closed Payments were made after WPTV listened to teachers' concerns about not getting paid for their work at Creative Learning Lab Academy WPTV Creative Learning Lab Academy By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — The Early Learning Coalition of St. Lucie County told WPTV it paid Creative Learning Lab Academy, the defunct private school in Fort Pierce, about $20,000 for preschool services after their final closure in October. Those payments came after teachers told WPTV they are still missing paychecks from their work at both the private school and preschool. Officials from the Early Learning Coalition, who disperse state dollars to various childhood services, said they paid the school around $180,000 in less than a year.WATCH: School received taxpayer dollars after closure Fort Pierce private school received taxpayer money after it closed Tony Loupe, who is the executive director for the coalition, said the group makes payments after receiving records from providers about their from prior months. He said the contract the group uses to make School Readiness Service payments requires those payments go directly to the school.“We pay the entity that is contracted with us,” Loupe said. “If once they receive those funds they choose to move those funds somewhere else, that’s their business decision and we don’t know anything about that.” He also said the organization received phone calls from teachers, who didn’t get paid by the school. Loupe said it’s “rare” teachers don’t get paid and ultimately up to the school’s owners on how to spend the money. “It definitely puts us in an awkward position,” he said to WPTV’s Ethan Stein in an interview last Monday. “The issue of teachers not getting paid is with the preschool and the owners and not us. I wish I had the ability to be able to pay them directly. But that would be in breach of our contract.” WPTV first learned teachers were working without pay after our news team obtained an email saying the school was unable to make payroll. At that time we knew Step Up For Students, a different nonprofit who distributes state-funded scholarships to make private school more affordable, paid the school about $44,000.Loupe said it’s the responsibility of the owners, Christopher and Balanga Madison, to make those payments. Christopher Madison hasn’t responded to WPTV’s requests for comment about the payment issue.PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Teachers at Fort Pierce school wait for paychecks Teachers at Fort Pierce school wait for paychecks Tayla King, who used to teach at the preschool, said she is one of many teachers who are missing paychecks. She said the money she worked for, but never received, has put her in debt.“It just felt like I was just doing that [teaching] for no reason,” said King. “Like all that time that I put into working, like all of that was for nothing. Like I just wasted my time.”King said she left her job at a different daycare to work at the preschool because she believed in owners Chris and Balanga Madison's vision to create a Black-owned school for underprivileged children. She said she loved the kids and the other staff members, but she thinks it all fell apart when the school couldn’t make payroll back in August. Education Teachers report no background checks at this Fort Pierce school Ethan Stein “I’m very in financial debt,” King said. “I had to try to borrow money, try do something so I can borrow rent, try to pay bills and everything. I personally feel like they owe me more… now that they put me in a financial struggle.”King said she had to borrow money from family and friends to make ends meet. She said she can’t afford a lawyer and since Florida dissolved its Department of Labor in 2002, she now has to file a complaint with the United States Department of Labor. King said she was struggling to get a response or anybody on the phone during the government shutdown.“You can’t even call anyone,” she said. “I call the line. They hang up on me. It’s just very frustrating.”King said she’s also frustrated she didn’t get paid after spending money to decorate her classroom. Education Teachers waiting for paychecks from this school now facing another obstacle Ethan Stein Multiple teachers also told WPTV earlier this month that they didn’t receive legally required background checks before they started working at Creative Learning Lab Academy. However, King said she did receive a background check. State law requires teachers and any other school employee to get a level two background investigation. Those investigations include sending fingerprints to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which did tell WPTV it had some prints on file for the Fort Pierce private school.However, multiple employees told WPTV they didn’t receive any background checks before entering the school even though offer letters said a successful “background screening” was required for employment.The Florida Department of Children and Families told us in October it is still working to get our news team information about any possible investigation or regulatory action against the school’s owners.",

Ron DeSantis is proposing that President Donald Trump's presidential library be built in a parking lot that is currently used by Miami Dade College staff and faculty and is adjacent to the Freedom Tower, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025, in Miami. By: Kate Payne, Associated Press Posted The board of the South Florida college that's giving away a valuable piece of property for Donald Trump's future presidential library revoted to transfer the land on Tuesday. The board of Miami Dade College faces a lawsuit filed by a local activist and a trial set for August over allegations it violated the state's open government law when it first voted to gift the parcel. The lawsuit said the board failed to provide sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property in downtown Miami. A judge has temporarily blocked the college from formally transferring the land, while the lawsuit plays out. Trump Lawsuit challenges vote over Trump's presidential library Kate Payne, Associated Press/Report for America The site is a developer’s dream and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One real estate expert wagered that the parcel — one of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard — could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.On Tuesday, the board held a new meeting at its campus in Hialeah, a predominantly Cuban American and Republican-leaning suburb of Miami. Dozens of students, professors, alumni and local officials packed the meeting to weigh in on the land transfer, an opportunity some felt they were denied when the board initially voted on the matter.
