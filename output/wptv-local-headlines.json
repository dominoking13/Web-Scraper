If they have good food and good music, it will do really well,\" Mullaly added, saying it will help bring new tourism to the area.This new music venue is the latest addition to the chain known as RockHouse Live. In a sneak peek, WPTV's Joel Lopez was granted access to the site and the plans that are about to rock the community.\"The bones were here; we've pretty much gutted it out,\" said Emilio Torres, head of the VIP Rock Room and retail store for RockHouse Live. \"We have a major indoor stage here, and a secondary stage on the far corner of the building. What used to be the tiki bar is now the rock deck, which will have major national talent on that stage outside.\"This venue prioritizes being a music venue first, but will be complete with a full restaurant, bar, and VIP areas.In a true homage to the genre, the bar will feature beverages created by rock musicians themselves— for their 50-foot bar that Torres said is the longest in Jensen Beach.\"The space became available, and the demographic of this area is conducive to classic rock ’n’ roll, which is what our branding is all about,\" Torres said, when asked about the choice of this location. \"The age group of 45-65 year olds has pretty much populated the entire area; this is their music, and this is what they're going to love to see.\"Running the show is a passionate team of rock aficionados, including Zach Bair, the founder of the company.Torres highlighted Bair's impressive connections.\"He's worked with the likes of Slash, Rob Thomas from Matchbox 20, Peter Frampton, and Blondie,\" he said.Torres has his own list of musician contacts. With names like these in their back pocket, concert-goers can expect big names to headline monthly gigs.\"All of our famous musician friends have actually talked to us about what we're doing here,\" he said. \"This will be the biggest location in the country, between the locations in Memphis, Tennessee, Largo on the west coast of Florida, and down to Key West.\"As with any music venue, noise levels can be a concern.Torres reassured the community that they've been working closely with Martin County to address this matter. \"There aren't very many residential areas nearby, and the way the building is positioned, the noise will feed onto the beach,\" he explained with plans to adhere to the county's 10:30 p.m. cutoff for live outdoor music.RockHouse Live is committed to creating a platform for local talent, creating a stage in their own home town. \"It's so important; younger generations don't even know what real rock ’n’ roll is anymore,\" Torres shared. \"We want to see that coming in the door every day.\" The venue is gearing up to start hiring bartending, front-of-house, and back-of-house positions in November.RockHouse Live aims to officially open its doors in January.\"How about you? Do you feel like you're going to be stopping by?\" Lopez asked Mullaly.\"Sure, sure. I like music.

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach County Overdose deaths drop 60% in Palm Beach County as law enforcement cracks down on treatment facility fraud Decline outpaces statewide trends and positions county ahead of national efforts to combat the drug epidemic, according to local officials WPTV State Attorney Alexcia Cox By: Kayla McDermott Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — Palm Beach County has seen a dramatic 60% decrease in overdose deaths compared to three years ago, marking some of the best progress law enforcement has achieved since the opioid pandemic began nearly 10 years ago.The significant decline outpaces statewide trends and positions the county ahead of national efforts to combat the drug epidemic, according to local officials.WATCH: State attorney attributes decline to crackdown on drug treatment facilities Palm Beach County touts decline in drug overdose deaths \"Just about everyone in our community knows someone who has been affected by substance abuse,\" said Chief Michael Coleman of the Riviera Beach Police Department. Law enforcement across the county has been working for nearly a decade to change that reality, and officials say they are now seeing results. State Attorney Alexcia Cox attributes much of the progress to cracking down on widespread fraud and abuse in drug treatment and sober home facilities. \"It's progress that outpaces statewide trends,\" Cox said. The state attorney's office has made significant strides in addressing the problem through targeted enforcement efforts. \"We've made more than 120 arrests and secured over 110 convictions,\" Cox said. Jim and Adrienne Tichy, who run The Lodge recovery facility in Delray Beach, have witnessed the transformation firsthand. They remember when Delray Beach had hundreds of overdose deaths in a single year in an area that Adrienne Tichy describes as significant to the recovery industry. \"For those that don't know, [it] is the addiction treatment capital of the world,\" Adrienne Tichy said. \"When this first erupted, there was nothing but body bags coming out of this area,\" Jim Tichy said. The Tichys are now part of Delray's drug task force and praise the state attorney's office for its task forces focusing on patient brokering, fraud, and opening dialogue to find solutions in the addiction treatment industry. \"It's a hard job they're doing. They're doing a good job, too,\" Jim Tichy said.Adrienne Tichy acknowledges the industry's past problems while highlighting improvements in standards and oversight. \"Yes, there was corruption. Yes, there was corruption in the recovery residence community, but we have a standardization now. It's called the National Alliance for Recovery Residences, and we're members of both the national and the Florida chapter... There are good treatment centers. There are people doing the best they can with what is out there and and we just stand shoulder to shoulder every day, doing what we can in our neck of the woods,\" Adrienne Tichy said. Cox says these efforts have been vital in decreasing the number of deaths. \"It's a moment of pride for our community,\" Cox said.However, challenges remain. Despite the decrease in overdose deaths, the Tichys say fentanyl usage continues to rise. \"Fentanyl is still there, still alive and well, by a long shot,\" Jim Tichy said.Assistant State Attorney Al Johnson acknowledges that while significant progress has been made, the work continues. \"It's not done, but we've done so much to curb the opioid crisis,\" Johnson said.Another reason for the drops in overdose deaths: Narcan. The Tichys say everyone should have the life-saving drug on them at all times just in case someone is in need.

By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated STUART, Fla. — A Stuart city manager with more than two decades of service to the city faces potential termination after a commissioner unexpectedly called for his resignation during a public meeting this week, and a WPTV investigation finds taxpayers may foot the bill. WATCH BELOW: 'I applaud Commissioner Reed for taking action,' Robin Cartwright tells WPTV Taxpayers could be on the hook if Stuart city manager is fired Mike Mortell has spent more than 20 years with the city of Stuart — the last two as city manager. Some residents are calling the move to oust him an ambush.The shocking moment came during Monday's commission meeting when Commissioner Sean Reed used an agenda item he requested a week prior to discuss Mortell's contract, then instead moved to replace him.\"First I want to say that I totally respect you Mike for what you've done for the city and what you do for the city,\" said Reed, \"but what I'd like to ask for publicly is your resignation.\" Stuart residents Ted Astolfi and Robin Cartwright were among seven people who spoke during public comment, and hadn't expected to until Reed's surprising move. Both offered opposing views on the Mortell situation. \"It was shocking. It really was,\" Astolfi said, defending Mortell. \"I was compelled to speak, because suddenly there was this motion right on the box to request the resignation of our city manager, and without any justification, whatsoever.\" \"I applaud Commissioner Reed for taking action, because I feel like if you have something that you want to do, you should do it,\" Cartwright said, questioning Mortell's adherence to the city's code of conduct. \"I'm not so much in favor of somebody being fired, I want to be very clear. I'm more in favor of his contract being reviewed. And if he's not abiding by his contract, then the commission holding him to that.\"Reed didn't explain his reasoning, saying only he wasn't on the commission when Mortell was hired. Reed was backed by Commissioner Laura Giobbi and Vice Mayor Christopher Collins — all three recently elected.Giobbi alluded to \"issues of trust\" with Mortell, while Collins didn't elaborate on any concerns. Stuart 'I truly am surprised': City manager at risk of losing job Aja Dorsainvil \"Out of respect for Mike I would rather not open up everything and try to litigate his faults,\" Collins said during the meeting.Residents demanded transparency about the commissioners' reasoning.\"The public needs to know your reasoning and thought process and justification for taking this action,\" Astolfi said.\"I appreciate them wanting to protect somebody's integrity. But on the flip side, I think if we're going to have this discussion, it needs to be an honest discussion in the public with the public present,\" Cartwright said.WPTV's public records request revealed Mortell's contract, which shows commissioners can fire him without cause. His salary is $225,000, and firing without reason would force the city to pay him 20-weeks severance. Attorney Aaron Bass reviewed the contract and noted the financial implications for taxpayers.\"The taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for that if he is not fired for cause,\" Bass said.Bass pointed out the payout doesn't include the costly process of hiring a new city manager.\"That's not a cheap thing to do to just set about doing a search to hire a new city manager,\" Bass said. \"That's a lot of money that the taxpayers are going to be paying toward his salary, and the question is, what went on here if they are not firing with cause?\"WATCH BELOW: Stuart city manager at risk of losing job Stuart city manager at risk of losing job Stuart Mayor Campbell Rich said he was blindsided by the move and plans to demand answers at the next meeting.\"I am not aware of any complaints about Mike's performance and I will be meeting with every department head to ask that,\" Rich said.Collins said taxpayers deserve answers but wouldn't share details about the commissioners' concerns.\"Sometimes it's just a personnel switch, you know, and if there's more serious issues that might have been alluded to at the last meeting, I'm sure they'll come out,\" Collins said.\"Were you aware of these “serious issues” or were these things that other commissioners just alluded to?\" asked Investigative Reporter Kate Hussey.\"It's tough, like we can't talk, so you don't know how, what other interactions have happened,\" responded Collins. \"You don't want to see anybody take a beating for general frustrations, everybody's trying to do the best they can.\" Reed and Mortell did not return calls for comment.Mortell remains on the job for now, but commissioners will vote Oct. 27 on whether to fire him.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

    "content": "MoneyReal Estate News 8 proposals aim to cut property taxes in Florida: Here's what Rep. Toby Overdorf told WPTV 'We will not impact school taxes in any way, nor police and fire,' Overdorf says WPTV State Rep. Toby Overdorf speaks with WPTV reporter Matt Sczesny on Oct. 17, 2025, about new proposals to cut property taxes in Florida. By: Matt Sczesny Posted and last updated PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Florida lawmakers are moving forward with eight proposals aimed at reducing property taxes for homeowners, as rising costs continue to burden residents across the state.State Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart, chairs the Select Committee on Property Taxes and said the panel has one clear objective: cutting property taxes for Florida homeowners.WATCH BELOW: 8 proposals aim to cut property taxes 8 proposals aim to cut property taxes in Florida The committee has identified eight initial proposals for potential relief, including eliminating non-school homestead taxes, improving the homestead exemption, capping tax increases and eliminating what's known as portability restrictions.\"We will not impact school taxes in any way, nor police and fire,\" Overdorf said. However, other property taxes are being targeted for potential cuts. One of Overdorf's own proposals, House Joint Resolution 211, would eliminate portability restrictions, allowing homeowners to transfer their tax savings when they move to a new property located in Florida.\"People within the state, even if they downsize, would not get hit with a much higher property tax bill?\" WPTV reporter Matt Sczesny asked Overdorf on Friday. \"That is correct. They could take that portability number with them, and in some cases, they may actually not even have to pay property taxes,\" Overdorf said.The proposals face the challenge of reducing funding for counties and cities that rely on property tax revenue. Overdorf acknowledged this concern but believes there's room for cuts without affecting services.\"Right now, we're approaching $60 billion just in property taxes across our state. I sincerely believe there is an opportunity for pullback of that revenue within local government and still receive the same services,\" Overdorf said.The timeline for these proposals is moving quickly. Overdorf's committee and other legislative committees will begin studying the proposals next month, with lawmakers potentially voting on them as early as January. The Proposals at a Glance Categorical Eliminations:HJR 201 (Rep. Steele): Eliminates non-school property taxes for homesteads entirely.HJR 203 (Rep. Miller): Phases out those same taxes over ten years, with an additional $100,000 exemption added each year.HJR 205 (Rep. Porras): Exempts Florida residents 65 and older from paying non-school property taxes on homesteads.Additional Exemptions:HJR 207 (Rep. Abbott): Creates a new 25% homestead exemption on non-school taxes — aiding current and first-time homebuyers.HJR 209 (Rep. Busatta): Offers an extra $100,000 exemption to homeowners who carry property insurance, intended to ease overall housing costs.Reforms:HJR 211 (Rep. Overdorf): Eliminates the cap on “portability,” allowing homeowners to transfer their entire Save Our Homes benefit to a new property, even if it’s of lesser value.HJR 213 (Rep. Griffitts): Adjusts caps on taxable value growth — limiting increases to 3% over three years for homesteads (currently 3% annually) and 15% over three years for non-homesteads (currently 10% annually).HB 215 ( Rep. Albert): Would require a two-thirds vote to raise local millage rates and allow newly married couples to combine their Save Our Homes benefits.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach West Palm Beach police union claims new evidence exonerates suspended officers Fraternal Order of Police says suspended officers were targeted WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — West Palm Beach's police union believes they've uncovered new evidence that could exonerate seven police officers suspended for their alleged involvement in a \"double-dipping\" scheme.The officers were placed on paid leave last October after being accused of working overtime details during their regular scheduled shifts, effectively getting paid twice for the same hours. WATCH BELOW: Union claims new evidence exonerates suspended officers Union claims new evidence exonerates suspended West Palm Beach officers Documents obtained by the union, shown to WPTV reporter Ethan Stein, show the police department said captains, like those suspended, were able to flex their schedule to work overtime details at other times.\"Command Staff positions are subject to flex scheduling and/or hours at the direction and authority of the Chief of Police,\" reads the 12-page document in response to a 2020 city internal audit finding officers were being overpaid back during Fiscal Year 19. \"Management submits that the identified employees (as well as the entire Command Staff) routinely work more than 40 hours per week without \"hourly compensation…The identified 'overlapping' hours would only be relevant if these staffers worked standard hours; they do not and their ability to work some overtime details at unusual hours is authorized by the Chief of Police.\"Adam Myers, who is the president of the Fraternal Order of Police in West Palm Beach, said these statements show the city knew about captains changing their schedules to work various overtime details. He also said these documents show that the criminal investigation and internal investigation about the alleged time stealing was never necessary.\"This wasn't criminal,\" Myers said. \"This was an internal issue within the department, and these employees were targeted for whatever reason, but that memo right there proved our point.\"The seven police officers suspended, according to WPTV's past reporting, include various members of the command staff, including an assistant chief and multiple captains. The police department asked the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office to investigate those officers criminally. However, in April, the sheriff's office announced it didn't find enough evidence to recommend charges. Their investigation found that salaried officers at the West Palm Beach Police Department would change their hours when they had to work various situations or attend meetings. Former Police Chief Frank Adderley explained the situation to investigators from the sheriff's office in body camera video WPTV obtained from a public records request.\"You know, if the guys had a homicide like the night before, 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., I don't think he's coming in 8 a.m.,\" Adderley said in the footage.Adderley was fired by Mayor Keith James as police chief last year, citing a variety of instances, including financial improprieties among staff members. James has never specified those claims, but the seven officers were suspended after Adderley’s firing. Letters that WPTV obtained show those officers were placed on paid leave for overtime/financial misconduct.Myers told WPTV that he believes these officers are being targeted by the department.\"You gotta question what the motivation is behind this,\" Myers said. \"If the city administration is aware that this issue has been identified and addressed, why did it surface again?\"The city of West Palm Beach declined to comment on this story because of an ongoing internal investigation into the officers. However, audio obtained by our newsroom reveals the department's new leadership team believes the suspended captains created a toxic culture, referring to them as \"Seal Team Six.\"\"Many people who have come forward and say, 'You know, we're so glad that change is happening,' because it appears that many were under the assumption that 'Seal Team Six' was not only stifling careers (but) ruining careers,\" Deputy Chief Tony Shearer said. \"And if you get in the way of their efforts, if you try to openly complain about what they were doing, your career would be in danger.\"He said captains were able to pick premium details for overtime first, based on seniority, and then shift their hours to cover the details. He said this led to complaints from the rank-and-file officers.\"It was my understanding that because of all the complaints coming from the officers, sergeants and lieutenants, who couldn't do this shift, change adjust,\" Shearer told investigators. \"They were saying this is hypocritical and this is wrong.\"However, the union believes these suspended officers should get their jobs back because they did nothing wrong. They are part of a lawsuit, along with some of the suspended officers, working to get their jobs back and return to the department. The next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. );",

Reed offered no explanation why, except to say he wanted to help pick the next city manager. Stuart city manager at risk of losing job Mortell has been the city manager of Stuart for two years.

The Boca Raton “No Kings” protest is scheduled for Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon in front of Boca Raton City Hall.Trump arrived at Palm Beach International Airport at about 6:30 p.m. Friday for his first weekend visit of the season to Mar-a-Lago. Flight restrictions are in place in Palm Beach County from 4:15 p.m. Friday to 6:30 p.m. Sunday. Some Republican leaders have labeled the \"No Kings\" protests as anti-American. House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed, without evidence, that Saturday's planned rallies have contributed to the ongoing government shutdown. WATCH BELOW: NORAD prepares for airspace violations during Trump visit NORAD prepares for air space violations during Trump's visit to Palm Beach County When the first round of \"No Kings\" protests took place in June, Trump had just barreled through the first five months of his second term with hundreds of executive orders and other moves targeting birthright citizenship, protections for transgender people, student protesters, federal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and more.Tension over immigration raids reached a fever pitch with protests in Los Angeles, where Trump federalized the California National Guard against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom — a move that experts warned was an unprecedented and dangerous escalation of presidential power.Over the summer, the administration has only \"doubled down,\" protest organizers say.ICE agents, under pressure to meet the administration's arrest quotas, have performed raids throughout the country, sometimes met with fervent protests by community members. Trump has called on the Justice Department to prosecute his political opponents, former FBI director James Comey and Attorney General of New York Letitia James. The administration has challenged unflattering media coverage, resulting in a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and the suspension (and eventual return) of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"And the administration has escalated its attempted deployment of federal troops into Democratic-led cities, like DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.Local and state leaders have pushed back against the National Guard deployments, and legal battles are still playing out in court.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's coverage of the 'No Kings' protest in West Palm Beach in June Crowds gather in West Palm Beach for 'No Kings' protest Some Republican politicians have branded the upcoming protests as \"Hate America\" rallies. GOP Sen. Roger Marshall alleged \"professional protesters\" and \"agitators\" will show up, and Johnson suggested participants would be \"pro-Hamas\" and \"Antifa people.\"But organizers are planning for peaceful demonstrations aimed at providing a clear contrast to the administration's recent show of force. Could the protests prompt more military force? \"We'll have to get the National Guard out,\" Marshall recently said about Saturday's protests. \"Hopefully it'll be peaceful. I doubt it.\"CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on the possibility of National Guard deployment to Saturday’s protests.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday directed the state's National Guard to deploy troops to Austin ahead of a planned protest his office characterized as being \"antifa-linked.\"Texas Democrats were quick to condemn the move.\"Sending armed soldiers to suppress peaceful protests is what kings and dictators do — and Greg Abbott just proved he's one of them,\" Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu said Thursday.Indivisible Project, the nonprofit organizing the protest, has trained tens of thousands of people in safety and de-escalation, and organizers are working directly with cities that have a National Guard presence to make sure they are prepared, its co-executive director, Leah Greenberg, said.In other areas, organizers have been working to educate protesters on their rights, in the event troops show up somewhere unexpected.\"We do not expect there to be any need for the National Guard to be deployed, but if the Trump administration attempts to do that as a way to intimidate peaceful protests, we are prepared for that,” Deirdre Schifeling of the ACLU said Thursday at a meeting of protest organizers.\"What we are expecting is millions of people around the country collectively showing up to oppose authoritarianism, corruption and attacks on our neighbors and our rights,\" Greenberg told CNN.The administration has already planned another celebratory military show of force in California set to take place on the same day as the protests, Newsom noted Wednesday.Organizers hope to build on the momentum of June's protests and the Hands Off! and 50501 protests this spring. They're confident the movement has grown steadily in response to the administration’s actions.For local leaders who have tried to push back against what they describe as federal overreach in their cities, Saturday may provide an opportunity to send a message.Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is set to headline the No Kings event in her city this Saturday. Following recent protest activity in Boston, Trump threatened to pull the FIFA World Cup out of Massachusetts next year, a move Wu says Trump does not have the authority to make.It's possible the protests could prompt the administration to send more military force into cities, said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.The memorandum Trump used to send the first round of federal troops into Los Angeles can be used to take similar action around the country, Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, told CNN.\"Under this memorandum, troops can be deployed if there are entirely peaceful protests,\" she said, calling it \"a direct attack on First Amendment freedoms.\"And almost any violence on the part of individual protesters could end up bolstering the administration’s case for calling in troops, she said.\"So might the administration use the protests this weekend as justification to deploy troops? It certainly looks that way,\" she added.As for whether people will see troops on the ground in new locations as protests play out Saturday, Goitein noted that it takes some planning to mobilize troops and direct them to a particular location.\"It can't be done at the snap of anyone’s fingers, so if we were to see the military deployed at these protests, that means it was in the works beforehand,\" she said. 'A big tent' protest effort As the government shutdown continues to threaten federal workers' jobs and seeps into daily life, some Republican lawmakers have suggested that the protests are a distraction compounding the shutdown.Asked when the shutdown will end, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week, \"There’s a thought out there that they're at least waiting 'til this crazy No Kings rally this weekend … No Kings equal no paychecks.\"Greenberg called the criticism \"transparently ridiculous,\" saying the protests were planned in September, before the government shutdown, and are “a big tent effort” encompassing a range of political identities and viewpoints.Greenberg also pushed back against the idea that the protests are anti-American.\"No Kings is about as American a value as you can imagine. It is as American as apple pie,\" she said.\"My husband and I were at the flagship event in Philly in June — the birthplace of the nation, which is why we chose it, and we led the crowd in the Pledge of Allegiance,\" she added.Greenberg co-founded the progressive grassroots network Indivisible with her husband Ezra Levin in 2016 in response to Trump’s first election. It’s grown to include thousands of local Indivisible groups, which function autonomously but coordinate with national staff.The network encompasses the nonprofits Indivisible Project and Indivisible Civics, which organize protests and trainings, and Indivisible Action, a separate political action committee aiming to elect progressive candidates.Greenberg said she's aware that organizations like Indivisible that have taken a public stance against Trump may be targeted by the administration.After conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death, Indivisible joined more than 500 nonprofits in an open letter condemning what the groups described as the use of government power to target liberal organizations and threaten First Amendment rights.Trump has recently taken aim at billionaire investor George Soros for funding \"violent protests,\" calling for racketeering charges against the philanthropist, and the White House has called Indivisible a \"left-wing activist group\" that has \"received more than $7.6 million\" from Soros.Soros' long-running nonprofit, Open Society Foundations, has provided millions in funding to Indivisible over the years, along with a vast number of predominantly left-leaning causes. Indivisible Project received almost $8 million in contributions from various sources in fiscal year 2023.\"We're heartily aware that there are ongoing efforts to kill organized opposition — to retaliate, to come after people who stand against Trump and his agenda,\" Greenberg said. \"We're aware of those things, and also we believe that we have one path forward, which is to continue to exercise our constitutional rights.\"The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The streets are big enough and long enough for them to use.” This new rule follows Senate Bill 462, which gives cities and towns more power to regulate these devices.The new rule bans bikes on commercial sidewalks, with violators facing penalties.Some have mixed feeling about the change, and other worry this could make things less safe, since not every street has a bike lane. North Palm Beach Officials crack down on e-bikes after golf course damage Audra Schroeder “I don’t really think it’s actually safe on the streets, so if they’re not on the sidewalks, can they be on the streets?
