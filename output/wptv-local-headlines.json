    "content": "WeatherHurricane Double Trouble: Humberto Strengthens, Bahamas System Eyes Development wptv By: James Wieland Posted Invest 94L/Imelda: A tropical wave near Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos is showing signs of strengthening. Forecasters expect it to form a low-pressure system today as it moves into the southeastern Bahamas, with a good chance it becomes a tropical depression by later today or over the weekend.Whether it develops or not, the system is already bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to parts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Turks and Caicos, and that weather will likely spread to the Bahamas and eastern Cuba soon.There’s still uncertainty in its path and strength, but the risk of wind, rain, and coastal impacts along parts of the Southeast U.S. is growing. Residents in those areas should keep an eye on this system.Humberto is now a hurricane, and gaining strength in the western Atlantic, with winds now up to 75 mph. Satellite images show the storm becoming more organized, with tall, cold cloud tops and active thunderstorms mainly on its eastern side. It’s moving slowly right now due to weak steering winds, but it’s expected to pick up speed and head northwest, eventually turning north by the weekend.Conditions around Humberto are very favorable for rapid strengthening — warm ocean waters, moist air, and light wind shear. Because of that, expect it to intensify significantly over the next few days, possibly reaching major hurricane status by the weekend. Humberto will stay well east of us (~800miles) and not impact our weather, but we will have coastal impacts with large swells in combination with Imelda next week.TRACKING THE TROPICS: Hurricane Center | Hurricane Guide ; }).then(); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego WPTV takes a look back at historic tornado outbreak Surfing Blog Hurricane Duo to bring swell next week James Wieland HURRICANE GUIDE 2025 STORM NAMESAndreaBarryChantalDexterErinFernandGabrielleHumbertoImeldaJerryKarenLorenzoMelissaNestorOlgaPabloRebekahSebastienTanyaVanWendy TERMS TO KNOWTROPICAL STORM WATCH: An announcement that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are possible within the specified coastal area within 48 hours.TROPICAL STORM WARNING: An announcement that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are expected within the specified coastal area within 36 hours.HURRICANE WATCH: An announcement that hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or higher) are possible somewhere within the specified coastal area.

That student then retracted their confession, saying they felt threatened at the time of questioning. School officers ran a handwriting analysis where they determined the writing on the note and the student’s do match.However, Brooke Scott said no action has been taken aside from being told that her daughter, Locklyn, can transfer out of the classroom or into a new school. “They are completely negligent. These are real threats, and they're terrifying,” Brooke Scott said. Pushing the Palm Beach County School District I looked into the incident, the police response and school district policies about threats. I asked the Palm Beach County School District if this is protocol as the district’s code of conduct states any threat to kill or do bodily injury are grounds for expulsion but I was told “for the current school year, we can confirm that there have been no viable threats at this school” and the district police report stated the investigation “lacked sufficient evidence.” Locklyn Scott knows she'll have to get used to going to school at home, but she told me she's glad her parents pulled her out of Panther Run Elementary school. “I'm really happy that they did that, because I also didn't feel safe there,” she said.Below is the complete statement from Palm Beach County School District in response to WPTV’s questions: The School District of Palm Beach County cannot comment on individual student matters or the specific circumstances involving a student due to student privacy laws and regulations, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).The safety and security of our students and staff are the highest priorities of the School District of Palm Beach County. We take all threats with the utmost seriousness, and we adhere to a rigorous, systematic Threat Assessment Protocol across all of our campuses.In keeping with Florida law and our established policies, any staff member who receives information about a potential threat must immediately report it. An assessment is conducted, and any potential threat is addressed quickly. This process utilizes dedicated staff and operates on strict timelines to support a secure learning environment.Any student who threatens the safety of another student, staff member, or the school community will face strict discipline as outlined in the Student Code of Conduct. And in Florida, making a threat against a school is a second-degree felony.For the current school year, we can confirm that there have been no viable threats at this school.As noted in your attachment, School Police investigated this matter as well.We urge anyone with a safety concern to promptly report it to a trusted adult or through the FortifyFL app. ; }).then();",

By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Downtown West Palm Beach had no assigned code enforcement officer for about nine months, according to a city spokesperson.WPTV uncovered the issue after inquiring about a few properties that were cited for violations after sitting untouched for years. Those buildings appear vacant with overgrown plants, chipped paint and graffiti on walls. It's one of the first times we've seen code enforcement actions within the downtown area.WATCH BELOW: West Palm Beach went 9 months without code enforcement Downtown West Palm Beach went 9 months without code enforcement Kat Joy, who is a spokesperson for the city of West Palm Beach, said code enforcement is complaint-driven. However, the city also has a staffed code enforcement officer in various geographic zones of the city. She said the downtown position was vacant in September 2024 and then filled in June 2025, which is a gap of about nine months.\"Staffing may be temporarily adjusted if positions are vacant or officers are reassigned,\" Joy wrote in an email. \"Downtown has an assigned officer who conducts routine proactive inspections and responds to complaints submitted through the City's official channels.\"The properties WPTV saw code violations included: 530 Clematis St.527 Datura St. 525 Datura St. State records show each of those properties is owned by an LLC controlled by well-known real estate developer Jeff Greene. On Thursday, WPTV saw employees trying to clean up the graffiti at the properties on Datura Street.Anges Hunt, who said she works near these properties, has walked past these locations often over the last four years. She said she's surprised the city decided to cite them recently for code violations since they've sat untouched for years.\"I'd be frustrated if I'm the owners,\" Hunt said. \"All of a sudden, now you just come and say, 'Hey, you need to do this! You need to do that!' It needed to be enforced long ago.\"The position for downtown code enforcement officer became open after Jennifer Ferriol, who was also the director of Housing and Community Development, took over the city's code department in late 2024. However, WPTV reporter Ethan Stein learned Ferriol left the city earlier this month.Both the city and Ferriol declined to give any rationale for her departure. This now means a new person will oversee the city's affordable and workforce housing development, real estate and lease management, homeless and social services, various entitlement programs and code enforcement. ; }).then();",

He even tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen when the conviction was read.Routh represented himself in court. His daughter explained why.“We're not rich, we don't have funds, we don't have the means to hire a private attorney,” she said. “He felt like he was back against the wall, and he felt like he was the only one that could get his message across. He has no law education, no background, not even Law Library to, like reference to or anything.”Despite the conviction, she insists the fight isn’t over, as she makes a plea for help.“I will appeal,” said Routh. “I am looking for any and everybody that is willing to stand behind me and my father, to find a way to appeal this case.”“We figured there'd be a lot more support,” she added.Former Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg told Hoffman there could be grounds for an appeal.“It is legitimate grounds for appeal that the judge should never have allowed Ryan Routh to represent himself,” said Aronberg.\"I would say that that has a greater chance of succeeding on appeal than he ever had in gaining an acquittal in this case.”“I still think it's an uphill climb for Routh to win on appeal,” Aronberg added.“I think he's going to end up dying in prison. I think he'll get life in prison and he’s done, but there's always that chance that, because he is so erratic, because he clearly had no idea of what he was doing as his own lawyer, that he could claim there was a Sixth Amendment violation of his right to a fair trial, even though he was the one who made the decision from the beginning.”“Our family is going through a lot,” Sara said.“I am open to talk to anybody willing to help us.”Routh will be sentenced on December 18th, court documents say his deadline for appeal comes within two weeks of his sentencing. ; }).then();",

Attendees voiced their concerns over the increasing deportations and heightened fear affecting families in the area.One voice that stood out during the event was that of Alida Gomez, a mother of two and a newborn. \"The situation we're living in with immigration isn't secure,\" she shared in Spanish. \"Yes, it's affecting all of us a lot, all of us.\" Gomez opened up about the heartbreaking implications of these crackdowns, revealing how they have torn her family apart.In June, Gomez received a life-altering phone call from her husband, while she was seven months pregnant.He informed her that his landscaping truck had been pulled over by law enforcement, leading to his detention.Her husband was the breadwinner while she finished her pregnancy and cared for the kids.\"How do you explain something like that to your children?\" WPTV's Joel Lopez asked. The emotional weight of her response was palpable.\"It was so difficult. They would see me cry and ask 'Mom, what's happening? Mommy, what's happening?' At one point I had to explain to them that they took Daddy; it's going to be just us.\"Gomez said her husband was taken to the Alligator Alcatraz detention center and eventually deported back to Guatemala, leaving her to care for her two kids, and their baby girl that was born months later.\"When we came here from Guatemala, we wanted to make something of ourselves, we wanted to get ahead. Now I'm struggling with the kids,\" she expressed. \"I go outside in fear, I take my children to school in fear; when I leave the house, I bring my kids because if something happens, I know they'll be with me.\"Her family relied on organizations like the Esperanza Center for help with necessities like food and diapers. Now, Gomez is planning to move to Guatemala to reunite with her husband and family.\"We don't feel safe here,\" said Gomez.The Esperanza Center has been dedicated to supporting all members of the community in need for six years, providing educational resources, food, and supplies while encouraging local families to connect and pay it forward.\"The way that we get stronger is we come together as a community,\" said Patrick Williams, whose wife, Maricela Torres, is the executive director of the center. \"Everybody can help out in different ways; it's not always money; it's volunteering, it's supporting the organization in different ways as far as sponsorship.\"Williams emphasized the importance of community involvement. “This organization is here to support the community, and it’s done on the backs of people that have seen the vision and supported it, and it continues to do great things,” he said.The center is actively seeking donations and support from community members of all backgrounds to expand their resources.However, there’s a palpable sense of loss within the local community, as staff at Esperanza reported a 30% drop in the immigrant population nearby since the onset of stricter enforcement policies.They could not say if the loss is from people who moved away, were deported, or are in hiding.Local cosmetologist Lidia Perez addressed this issue, sharing the emotional toll it’s taken on families. \"I have a 10-year-old son who said, 'Mom, my classmate isn't going to come back to school, because his dad was deported and he has to move,'\" Perez recounted. \"Imagine hearing that. It impacted me, because I have kids, and I can't imagine my children not being by our side.\"She noted the stark difference in the street corners of West Palm Beach, which were once bustling with workers waiting for job opportunities. \"There used to be so many workers. I would pass by every day going to work. If I go by now, they're gone. Why? Because they're afraid that they'll be deported. So think about it, how are those families surviving?\" Perez urged the community to support food kitchens and organizations that assist families in need.\"I’m very thankful for WPTV for being here, because through you our voices can be heard, so thank you,\" Perez concluded, reminding everyone of the importance of ensuring that their stories reach a larger audience.WPTV wanted to look into the overall impact of immigration enforcement and found new data from the Department of Homeland Security.DOH numbers shed light on the recent actions taken against undocumented immigrants.As of now, over 2 million illegal migrants have been removed from the U.S., with 1.6 million choosing to self-deport, while over 400,000 have been deported.More than 200,000 deportations are expected by the end of the year. ; }).then();",

By: Tyler Hatfield Posted and last updated On Tuesday, two separate double fatal crashes occurred on State Road 710, just hours apart, in both Martin and Palm Beach County.With four deaths in one day on the same road, WPTV is taking your safety concerns straight to the sheriff and the Florida Department of Transportation.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's Tyler Hatfield is learning more about Tuesday’s crashes and long-term plans to make the road safer 'Bloody 710': Neighbors want solution for SR-710 after 2 double fatal crashes on Tuesday According to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office, there was a head-on collision on State Road 710 just before noon that killed two people.Hours later, another double fatal occurred. This time, farther north near the FPL Access Road on Warfield Boulevard.For 22 years, Forrest Yingling lived near SR-710. He said he's not surprised.\"It's par for the course,\" said Yingling. \"Bloody 710, they call it.\"Just next door, Heather Daniel Smith said it's personal.\"Two of my friends were killed on this road,\" said Smith.Residents say the problem is drivers trying to pass cars on the two-lane stretch of Warfield Boulevard from Indiantown to Okeechobee.\"If there's a car going slow, people are killing themselves to get around them,\" said Smith. \"They're passing on double yellow lines, the passing lane.\"A solution, for some neighbors, is to make the SR-710 four lanes, just as it is south into Palm Beach County.\"Where slower cars could get to the one side and people could pass safely,\" Smith said.Martin County Sheriff John Budensiek said it's one of the most dangerous roads in the county.Budenseik said they've heard neighbors' concerns and dedicated members with their traffic unit to the roadway.Since 2022, there have been over 1,063 crashes on Warfield Boulevard, 10 of which have been deadly.Budensiek said deputies have issued around 3,200 tickets in the past year.\"That's a lot of citations for that road, probably more than any other road, per capita,\" said Budensiek.Budensiek also supports widening the Warfield Boulevard.\"It's not the county's responsibility,\" Budensiek said. \"It's FDOT's responsibility to fix that road.\"WPTV took their concerns to FDOT, and they say in a statement:\"The Department reviews all fatal crashes to find ways to improve safety.\"A spokesperson with FDOT also told WPTV they developed multiple plans to enhance safety along SR-710.Those include intersection improvements at SW Warfield Boulevard and CR-714, which consisted of installing additional signage (including LED-lit signs) and pavement markings.Work was completed in late spring 2024.FDOT said earlier this year that they completed adding a westbound left-turn lane at the intersection of SR-710 and SW Tommy Clements Street. The department started working on an eastbound right turn lane at the intersection, which is expected to be completed in Spring 2026.As for widening SR-710 to four lanes, FDOT said they're in the design phase for widening the road from Southeast 126 Boulevard to Southwest Van Buren Avenue. FDOT said the right-of-way phase is funded starting in Fiscal Year 2027.FDOT said construction for Southeast 126th Boulevard in Okeechobee County to Allapatah Road is not funded in the Department's five-year work program for Fiscal Year 2026-2030, estimated at $248 million.However, Construction from Allapattah Road to Southwest Van Buren Avenue is funded in fiscal year 2030, estimated at $16.9 million, according to FDOT.However, residents fear more crashes could happen before then.\"We're just falling through the cracks,\" said Smith. ; }).then();",

    "content": "NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyFort Pierce Why was Ryan Routh allowed to defend himself during Trump attempted assassination trial? Routh was ruled competent enough to represent himself, but tried to kill himself with a pen after verdict Lothar Speer This courtroom sketch shows U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon listening to Ryan Routh during his trial where he is charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump last year at a golf course in South Florida, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025, in Fort Pierce, Fla. By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — A legal expert is questioning Ryan Routh's ability to represent himself after new court records reveal the dozens of exhibits he wanted to show the jury as evidence in the case.Routh was found guilty of trying to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, along with four other related charges. He now faces the possibility of life in prison.WATCH BELOW: Why was Routh allowed to defend himself during trial? Why was Ryan Routh allowed to defend himself during Trump attempted assassination trial? Routh was allowed to represent himself as his own defense attorney.However, his defense only lasted less than three hours after a judge ruled his exhibits of evidence and witnesses couldn't be introduced to the jury.Judge Aileen Cannon ruled these pieces of evidence were irrelevant to the trial and were submitted past the discovery deadline.They include Routh's autobiography called \"Not My America\", a letter to the leaders of North Korea, various items related to his time in Ukraine, pieces of a skate park, various haikus, locker shelves he built, as well as his Eagle Scout application and dozens of other items.Court records show a lot of Routh's witnesses were character witnesses, which were mostly ruled irrelevant to the case.Attorney Michelle Suskauer told WPTV these pieces of evidence would have never been allowed in a courtroom. She said Routh's attempts to present this evidence are proof he doesn't understand the rules of evidence proficient enough to overcome her efforts.\"He's not familiar with the rules of federal criminal procedure, and he's not an experienced attorney, so that is certainly a detriment to him and his defense,\" Suskauer said.Routh also stabbed himself with a pen after the verdict was read Tuesday afternoon. WPTV reporter Kate Hussey saw U.S. Marshals tackle Routh as his daughter screamed in the back of the courtroom. Ryan Routh tries to stab self with pen after guilty verdict Cannon allowed Routh to represent himself after a hearing earlier this year.The hearing occurred after Routh asked the court to represent himself, which is his constitutional right under the 6th Amendment, and also requested his public defenders be removed from the case.Cannon said Routh's forensic evaluation referenced that he had mixed personality features, but didn't impede his ability to knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel.The judge also used an eight-factor test to make the decision, which included:Defendant's age, health and educationDefendant's contact with lawyers prior to trialDefendant's knowledge of the nature of the charges and possible defenses and penaltiesDefendant's understanding of the rules of evidence, procedure and courtroom decorumDefendant's experience in criminal trialsWhether standby counsel was appointed and, if so, the extent to which standby counsel aided in the trialAny mistreatment or coercion of the defendantWhether the defendant was attempting to manipulate the trialRegardless, Cannon repeatedly reprimanded Routh to follow the rules of evidence during the trial and asked questions to ensure he would follow the rules.There were also consequences for not following the rules, including Routh's opening and closing statement being cut short, sudden calls for impromptu breaks and Routh occasionally appearing intimidated to object or challenge government prosecutors.At one point during closing arguments, Routh even asked to reinstate his public defender. However, Cannon denied that request.
