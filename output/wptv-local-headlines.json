Their struggles seemed to follow the Food and Drug Administration’s updated recommendations, which limit vaccine access to people at least 65 years old or those younger but with certain health conditions and a prescription from their doctor.Still, Floridians we‘ve spoken with haven’t been able to get the shot.“I tried online at CVS, Walgreens, Publix, Costco, but nothing,” a Tampa woman told us earlier this month.Stephen Stanford of Venice said he would be willing to go wherever he needed to so he and his partner could get the booster. His partner has severe lung disease. This past Friday, things became murkier when a CDC vaccine advisory panel also recommended limiting the vaccine.Though Florida’s surgeon general has publicly denounced the vaccine, despite numerous requests, his office had declined to weigh in on whether the shot would even be available to Florida, that is, until now.In his post on Tuesday on X, the Surgeon General called the vaccine \"unsafe\" and \"not fit for human use,” but he added, “the decision to administer them at a pharmacy rests in the hands of the pharmacist or pharmacy. FDOH is not involved in this decision,” he posted.Here is what we know right now on COVID-19 vaccine availability in Florida:Publix started making the shot available to eligible patients Tuesday. Walgreens is offering the vaccine but with restrictions, so you'll want to check with your local store. At CVS locations, the vaccine is also available to eligible patients. (Some viewers have told us that even though they’re over 65, they still needed to present a prescription) If you are interested in getting the vaccine, your best bet is to contact your local pharmacy first. ; }).then();",

By: Tyler Hatfield Posted and last updated MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — The proposed Brightline stop in Stuart is right off Southeast Flagler Avenue. Martin County leaders said they won’t know if they will get federal grant money until June of 2026. That means the earliest we’ll see trains stopping could be in January of 2028.WATCH BELOW: 'I believe our odds will be much greater of being awarded the station,' George Stokus tells WPTV Proposed Brightline station delayed due to federal funding Business owners in Stuart, like Lisa Freitas, said she wants the Brightline station here ASAP.“I'm excited to use it. I'm excited for my family to use it. I'm excited for the business,” said Freitas.But right now, there’s a delay. Martin County must re-apply for $45 million federal grant after the Federal Railroad Administration notified them that they would not reward any grants this year.“They've taken all the money from the previous year, rolled it into a new fund for $5 billion,” said George Stokus, assistant county administrator.Stokus said they’ll need to submit another application by January, with a decision expected by next June. Stokus said the delay could be a benefit.“My first grant application, I was trying to get $45 million from a total pot of $750 million,” said Stokus.Now, the county is asking for $45 million from a larger pool of funds.“I believe our odds will be much greater of being awarded the station,” said Stokus.The county said they will have the option to withdraw from the agreement if the grants fall through.Some people have expressed concern over the price tag, but Stokus said he supports Brightline.“When you look at the length of time it's going to take, having a project of this size and magnitude is well worth the wait,” said Stokus.If they get the funds, Stokus said it’ll take about 18 months for the new station.Read more of WPTV's coverage below: Region Martin County AGREEMENT DERAILED: Could Martin County sue Stuart for pulling out of deal?

And those rules are keeping people like Ava Sloane locked out.\"It's frustrating for me and I'm sure for many other people,\" Sloane said.It started in 2022 when she first applied for an MSFH grant, but then withdrew her accepted application because of the large cost she would have to pay out of pocket for a new roof.When she tried again this year, she was rejected based on her withdrawal from the 2022 application.\"I never received the grant in the first place. Why couldn't I reapply?\" she said. Real Estate News My Safe Florida Home: You had questions, and we got answers Matt Sczesny According to the statute covering the program, homeowners have one year, with an extra six months, to finish all the improvements in the application or the application is considered abandoned.Re-applying later is only accepted under three exceptions:a. The original grant application was denied or withdrawn because the application contained errors or omissionsb. The original grant application was denied or withdrawn because the home did not meet the eligibility criteria for a grant at the time of the previous application, and the homeowner reasonably believes that the home now is eligible for a grantc. The program's eligibility requirements for a grant have changed since the original application date, and the applicant reasonably believes that he or she is an eligible homeowner under the new requirements\"We'll see if we have a place to get a second look at some of these people,\" said state Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman, R-Highland Beach. \"I think there could be a legislative fix because this would be the result of running a very tight, efficient program and not allowing a few people to fall by the wayside.\"The bottom line is that homeowners need to know that if they back away from a grant, the My Safe Florida Home program will lock them out in the future, so be careful.

Florida's state voucher program gives families scholarships regardless of income.Boggess said that 92% of Jupiter Christian students are using school vouchers.

The City of Lake Worth Beach would then invest about $6 million, that the city manager said the city has available in funds. City commissioners have yet to make a decision, leaving the future of a replacement, public pool in Lake Worth Beach in limbo.Another Lake Worth Beach resident, Bob Southerland, expressed his frustration over the lack of swimming facilities.\"Lake Worth doesn't have a pool right now,\" he said. \"Like you reported recently, the Lake Worth Community the school bulldozed their pool, and our town pool hasn't been working for years and years and years.\" WATCH BELOW: 'Please, we need an aquatic center for the public,' swim coach Sally Welsh tells WPTV's Joel Lopez Lack of community pools in Lake Worth Beach Southerland, a dedicated swimmer, now relies on Lake Lytal Pool, stating that he often has to travel to Wellington on Sundays, as it is the only facility open at that time.Concerns are mounting as the county plans to rebuild the Lake Lytal Pool, with construction expected to begin this November.Southerland highlighted the situation at Lake Lytal.\"It's already used a lot in the summer; if you were to come here, this place is full,\" he said. \"There are school buses here, there are all sorts of camps that utilize this facility.\"\"It would be great if they broke ground tomorrow and we had a pool that the community could use a year from now,\" he further noted.WPTV worked to get answers from the county, which confirmed that the new aquatic center is being built in a different location within Lake Lytal Park.This means the current pool will remain open until the new facility is ready. Harvard Jolly I PBK Blackman commented on the importance of public access. \"To have that open to the public is fantastic,\" he said.The Lake Lytal project is an innovative public-nonprofit partnership between Palm Beach County and the YMCA, aimed at benefiting residents throughout the county.The construction cost for the Aquatic Center is estimated to be $35,671,194. The project is fully designed and awaits review and approval from the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners.If all goes according to plan, Parks and Recreation is tentatively looking at November 1 for the notice to proceed, with mobilization starting shortly thereafter.\"The pool for me has always been my go-to, I always feel like a million bucks when I get out,\" said Southerland.The entire project is expected to take 18 months to complete.Read more of WPTV's related coverage below: Region C Palm Beach County This is when the new state-of-the art YMCA is expected to open Joel Lopez Lake Worth Beach Could a new Olympic-sized pool come to Lake Worth Beach?

He faces up to 30 years in prison Facebook By: Dave Bohman , Audra Schroeder, Aja Dorsainvil Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier was in West Palm Beach Tuesday, to announce an arrest in one of the \"largest retail theft cases when it comes to baby formula.\" WATCH BELOW: 'Repeat offender' in theft case arrested The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO) identified the man accused of stealing baby formula on numerous occasions as Kenneth Jones Jr.Uthmeier, joined by Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, said Jones is a \"repeat offender\" who has stolen \"tens of thousands of dollars\" in baby formula from retailers like Walmart, Target and Publix, with Jones sometimes targeting two stores in the same day, according to court documents.\"Let's be clear, in Florida, if you steal, you're going to jail. If you steal again, you're going to jail longer,\" Uthmeier said during a news conference this afternoon. \"If you steal baby formula and you tick off all of our moms and babies out there, we're going to put you behind bars for as long as we can.\"Uthmeier stated that this is the first time someone is being charged with a first-degree felony for theft under a new law, signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis last year, which increases penalties for organized retail theft and porch piracy. Jones, 37, carried out over 50 thefts of baby formula worth a total of $70,000 from Publix, Target, and Walmart locations across Broward and Palm Beach counties from October 2024 to May 2025, according to court documents. On each occasion, Jones would steal a reusable shopping tote, or plastic bin, fill it with dozens of baby formula canisters, and leave the store without paying for the items.\"When it comes to baby formula, we've had significant shortages in the past that makes it challenging for moms out there,\" Uthmeier said.The attorney general referenced the 2022 baby formula shortage that left families searching empty shelves and turning to Craigslist ads for the essential product. Formula remains a prime target for organized theft rings due to its high resale value and consistent demand.I reviewed Jones' criminal record, which shows four arrests and two convictions for stealing clothes, electronics, tools and sporting goods in 2022 and 2024. The recent baby formula case represents his most serious charges under the new law.“This is not a victimless crime and Florida is not going to stand for it,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said. “You know who the victim of this crime is? You—because the retailers are going to jack up the price and put it on the consumer.\"Bradshaw explained that stores lose money from theft and often hire additional security to deter criminals. Those costs ultimately get passed down to customers through higher prices.The case demonstrates Florida's commitment to using enhanced penalties to combat organized retail crime, with prosecutors now able to pursue decades-long sentences for repeat offenders who previously faced lighter punishments.Thanks to the new law and his criminal history, Jones faces up to 30 years in prison.\"This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
