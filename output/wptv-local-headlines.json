Deputies repeatedly asked the man what was going on and why he was blocking traffic.At one point during the interaction, the man appears to take a swing at one of the deputies — but misses. Despite the apparent aggression, deputies remained calm and never escalated the situation.“We’re not charging him with anything,” one deputy is heard telling a bystander. “He’s obviously going through a crisis.”The man was safely taken into custody and transported to a nearby hospital under Florida’s Baker Act, which allows for temporary, involuntary mental health evaluation and treatment. He will not face any charges.CIT Training Credited for Peaceful OutcomeDeputies on scene credited their Crisis Intervention Team training for helping them safely manage the situation.“You guys called it in and asked for somebody that has CIT training. But I think pretty much every deputy goes through that training,” the deputy explained to the family.“You could tell by looking at him and talking to him that he’s not making these decisions.”A Viral Video with Missing ContextWhile the viral video clip captured only a split-second moment — what looked like a violent attack — the bodycam footage shows that deputies acted with patience and professionalism throughout the incident. What could have turned into a dangerous encounter was resolved without injury or arrest.Authorities are using the incident to highlight the importance of CIT training and encourage families to call for help when a loved one is in crisis. ; }).then();",

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach What West Palm Beach gets for hosting Palm Tree Music Festival Contract shows Palm Tree Music Festival will pay for various services and provide passes to city elected officials WPTV's Ethan Stein By: Ethan Stein Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — West Palm Beach’s newest music festival got a similar deal to hold a music festival as the city’s previous music festival, according to contracts WPTV received from a public records request.The contract shows the Palm Tree Music Festival will have to pay for all emergency and security expenses, as well as pay a $30,000 licensing fee and provide around 100 complimentary passes to the city. Records, WPTV requested from a public records request, show that those expenses are similar to the costs the city required Sunfest to pay to host a music festival downtown.Notably, the new contract with organizers Palm Tree Crew Events has a renewal option for 2027 and 2028, pending an agreement not less than three months prior to the proposed event date. Organizers said they have sold out of tickets for some tiers of the festivals, which advertisements said now start at $299 for general admission and $549 for VIP.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: What West Palm Beach gets for hosting Palm Tree Music Festival Unlike Sunset’s contact, the Palm Tree Music Festival doesn’t include an agreement to lease or sublease submerged lands along the Lake Worth Lagoon to accommodate floating docks. WPTV’s Ethan Stein also didn’t see any clause to close city docks in their contract, but it does mention a site plan could include floating docks.The site plan for the Palm Tree Music Festival includes the downtown Waterfront areas of the Great Lawn, Centennial Square, North and South Trellis, the Landing and Post Park. The contract said the event will start at 2 p.m. and end at 10 p.m. on Valentine's Day 2026. City of West Palm Beach According to the contract, the city will be reimbursed by the music festival for all emergency services, police and fire services and staffing identified in a security plan worked on between the license and the city’s police department. The festival will also pay for off-duty police officers as well as on-call community events division employees. WPTV found similar clauses in its contract with Sunfest.Dan Goode, who used to organize Sunfest Music Festival, said it cost their organization about $90,000 for police services and he said EMS/Fire services cost about $50,000. But, he said he expected this festival’s expenses to be less because it’s only one day compared to a week or three days like Sunfest.The city will also get complimentary passes, according to the contract. This includes four all-day passes for the Mayor, each city commissioner, the city administrator and each city administrator. Those passes will give those people access to sponsor hospitality areas for the event. The city will also get 16 All-Day passes, 75 one-day admission passes for distribution as appropriate and six All-Day passes allowing access to all the event areas with the same level of access as licensee staff and board.The city will also close South Flagler Drive from Banyan Boulevard to Datura Street, North Flagler Drive from Banyan Boulevard to South Clematis and North Clematis Street between Lantana and Flagler Drive starting the Sunday preceding the event. The city, per the contract, will close South Clematis Street between Narcissus Avenue and Flagler Drive.Similar to Sunset’s Contract, the festival acknowledges that the city’s parking garage will be available for parking and the city will set rates for the festival. The festival will also have to pay fees for metered bags as a result of the event. Organizers, according to the contract, will also get the right to install event banners on light stanchions along Flagler Drive in downtown West Palm Beach, starting 14 days before the event. According to the contract, organizers will pay to install those banners.The festival will also have to pay for grass/sod that dies as a result of the event, as well as pressure clean the areas deemed necessary by the city. WPTV reached out to Palm Tree Music Festival, who agreed to speak with WPTV on Tuesday but asked to wait a day after we sent them a list of topics, including the group’s relationship with related and security expenses.Related Ross, who is also a partner, to the event, didn’t respond to our request for an interview today. Rather, a spokesperson said in a written statement that the organization played a key role in getting the festival to West Palm Beach, including using local connections, hotel partners, restaurants and engagement opportunities. ; }).then();",

    "content": "NewsPalm Beach County Homeless Coalition of Palm Beach County clarifies funding concerns, county to continue providing funding WPTV’s Joel Lopez speaks with CEO Alexandria Ayala county who says county funding for staff is only 5% to 6% of the coalition’s overall budget WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — In a unanimous decision on Tuesday, Palm Beach County commissioners voted to continue their contract with the Homeless Coalition of Palm Beach County as part of its 10-year plan to end homelessness.WATCH BELOW: Nonprofit gets contract approved to continue helping people with housing This vote follows concerns raised a couple of weeks ago by Palm Beach County Vice Mayor Sara Baxter, who said she was worried about how the coalition was spending its funding. “It seems like the majority of the budget goes to employees. That isn’t why they were created. They were created to help out the homeless,” said Baxter.The funding in question is set out in a 10-year contract between the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners and the coalition, which began on July 2, 2019, and will run until September 30, 2029.This agreement provides the coalition with approximately $150,000 each year, contingent upon budget approvals by the board.During a recent county budget workshop, Baxter proposed pulling funding for the coalition.The commissioners responded by agreeing to examine the situation further and invited representatives from the coalition to attend the Tuesday meeting to clarify their financial allocations.WPTV searched for answers and met with Homeless Coalition CEO Alexandria Ayala, who revealed that county funding for staff represents only “5% to 6% of the coalition’s overall budget.” WATCH: Residents tell WPTV's Joel Lopez being homeless 'can be' hard Cases of homelessness in Palm Beach County decreased “A few years ago, we had a few new commissioners join last year. We just had two new commissioners join who mentioned on the record that they hadn't really read the contract,\" she elaborated, We're always open to clarity and questions, and I think we’ll be given a great opportunity to explain what we've done and where we want to go. What are your issues in your district that your folks need help with, and we're happy to talk about it.”When asked what the coalition would have done without the county's funding. “It could have ended up that we have to dissolve, or the board would have to find private funding for that same amount of money, which could be difficult in this environment right now,\" Ayala explained. \"So, we didn't really know where our future stood, but we're thankful that the county is supporting us and remains our partner.”Numerous coalition representatives attended the Board of County Commissioners meeting Tuesday. “What we are trying to do is to make sure that everyone in the county has a roof over their head,” stated Melissa McKinlay, president of the Homeless Coalition.She addressed the financial concerns tied to the $150,000 from the county, clarifying that, under the county contract, that money is specifically earmarked for staffing, and the coalition is strictly prohibited from providing any direct services in order to not compete with local nonprofits.County staff presented data showing that, over the past five years, the coalition has provided significant funding to other organizations, including Adopt-A-Family ($1,025,902), Gulfstream Goodwill ($845,533), and The Lord's Place ($306,552).In March, the county released its Point In Time count, which indicates the number of individuals experiencing homelessness.The count found that, in 2025, there were 1,520 people, a decrease from 2,126 in 2024. Palm Beach County 'Good news': Homeless count shows decrease but some may be unaccounted for Joel Lopez Ayala noted the potential reasons behind this decline worried that many people going unaccounted for after increased immigration enforcement, and new rules that prohibit people from sleeping overnight in public areas.“We have a real issue on our hands, and it’s getting more difficult with cuts on funding and the different rhetoric around how we treat and really analyze homelessness,” she stated.In the last couple of years, the coalition has helped over 450 individuals secure housing through various organizations.One of those organizations, Vita Nova, also attended the county meeting and reported that the Homeless Coalition contributed approximately $50,000 to their efforts. Marcello Hart, a 22-year-old who began receiving support from Vita Nova at age 19, spoke passionately at the county meeting on behalf of the coalition and the help they've provided Vita Nova. \"They’ve done a lot to keep me off the streets and into my own apartment. All of us rely on it, because without it, it would be impossible to live in the situation we live in,” Hart told WPTV.He further explained why he felt inclined to advocated for the homeless community. “If they can’t see it from our perspective, then most likely, they may not be willing to help us. The people that we work with, they don't go through what we go through, so I feel like it only makes sense for us, the youth, to come and speak up,\" he said. If we don't speak up, how are they going to know how serious we are about this problem?”\"You want to see what we do? That’s the impact right there,” Ayala added.Following the discussions, county commissioners requested that the Coalition return with a more detailed breakdown of their operations.The coalition stated they are currently working on planning two of its major fundraising events of the year: the Lewis Luncheon and the Mayors Ball.In response to inquiries about a controversial proposal from county commissioners to host the Mayor’s Ball at Mar-a-Lago, coalition representatives noted that a venue has not yet been selected but that they are actively collecting quotes from various locations, including Mar-a-Lago, as per county commission requests. ; }).then();",

Her targeted approach reflects expert advice about being selective in today's competitive environment.\"What I was doing and what I'm looking to continue to do is called order management,\" Korn said.Her highly specialized position led her to be particular about finding the right opportunities, relying heavily on networking strategies that experts recommend.\"They really say the job search is hidden jobs, that most of the jobs people get are through a warm introduction, which is the wording that's used, and really speaking to people you know,\" Korn said.This networking approach, whether in-person or through online groups, helped Korn get assistance with updating her resume.

Ron DeSantis says during meeting (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025, in Washington. By: Forrest Saunders Posted and last updated TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida leaders voted to bring the nation's first Donald Trump Presidential Library to downtown Miami — but the project is already sparking backlash, with critics warning it could also include a Trump-branded hotel.Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet voted unanimously Tuesday to convey nearly 3 acres of publicly-owned land in Miami-Dade County for the project. The site sits next to the historic Freedom Tower, a landmark for Cuban exiles.WATCH BELOW: Legal fight looms as Trump library planned in South Florida Trump Presidential Library planned for downtown Miami, sparking backlash \"It's a unique opportunity for the state,\" DeSantis said during the meeting. \"We're happy to support this motion.\"Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier added that Trump \"has a great story to tell\" and said Miami's growing role on the world stage made the location fitting.Eric Trump, head of the library foundation's trustees, hailed the Cabinet's approval in a statement, calling the project a \"bold landmark on Miami's skyline\" that would be \"one of the most beautiful buildings ever built.\" He also contrasted it with what he described as President Barack Obama's \"prison-like\" library design. Pushback Over Land and Transparency But opponents argue the parcel, appraised at more than $65 million — and currently used as a Miami-Dade College parking lot — was given away without public input.\"Whether this was Donald Trump or whether it was any president, I would not be a fan of anyone acquiring public land without getting public input on what to do with that land,\" state Sen.

I am outraged now and heartbroken,\" Dunn said. \"They're taking land that belongs to our children's future and giving it to Donald Trump for a library and hotel. This is unacceptable.\"Dunn and other critics point to reporting that the plan includes not just a library, but a Trump-branded hotel on the Biscayne Boulevard property.

That's political.\" What's Next If completed, the Miami project would be the first presidential library built in Florida — and the first affiliated with a state college.

What you need to know if Congress doesn't fund the government by Oct. 1 WPTV's Leonardo Marchesani By: Jamie Ostroff Posted and last updated U.S. lawmakers have until midnight Tuesday to pass legislation to keep the government funded. Key disagreements between Democrats and Republicans stem from healthcare spending.If the parties can't come to an agreement by the fast-approaching deadline, WPTV looked into different ways a partial government shutdown could impact your life.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's Jamie Ostroff tells us all we need to know about the impacts of a shutdown How will a government shutdown impact you? Care for VeteransWPTV asked the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs how a partial government shutdown would impact local veterans and their ability to receive health care. A spokesman provided a statement from Peter Kasperowicz, the agency’s press secretary, which said a shutdown would impact the following:· “VA will not provide Veteran career counseling or transition assistance program activities.· The GI Bill Hotline will be closed.· VA benefits regional offices will be closed.· VA will cease public affairs and outreach to Veterans.· VA will not permanently place headstones or maintain the grounds at VA national cemeteries.· VA will not process applications for pre-need burials.· VA will not print new presidential memorial certificates.”·Other services, according to Kasperowicz, will remain available during a shutdown:· “Veteran health care is not impacted. VA Medical Centers, Outpatient Clinics, and Vet Centers will be open.· VA benefits will continue to be processed and delivered, including compensation, pension, education, and housing benefits.· Burials will continue at VA national cemeteries. Applications for headstones, markers, and burial benefits processing will continue.· The Board of Veterans’ Appeals will continue decisions on Veterans’ cases.· VA Contact Centers (1-800-MyVA411) and the Veterans Crisis Line (Dial 988, Press 1) are open 24/7.”Social Security Fortunately, if you are receiving Social Security benefits, they won’t stop during a government shutdown, and you can still access your benefits and information online.But if you need help from a live person over the phone or in person, you might be out of luck - or face long delays, according to Yvette Cruz with the Council on Aging in St. Lucie County.“That's why here at the Council on Aging, we do provide computer classes,\" Cruz added. “We try to strengthen the seniors in their ability to use technology, and we do see that it's a problem, so we try our best here.”Cruz said any seniors needing assistance during a shutdown can contact the Council on Aging of St. Luice at 772-336-8608 or the Area Agency on Aging at 866-684-5885.Travel Air traffic controllers and TSA workers still have to come to work, but they won’t get paid until the shutdown ends.Travel expert Katy Nastro of Going.com said that could lead to issues at the airport if the shutdown continues for multiple weeks.\"Where travelers are really going to see the impacts, first and foremost, is going to be in the way of longer TSA lines,\" Nastro said. \"These essential workers are showing up to work and expecting back pay. But as this continues, it's almost like a recipe for poor morale.”If you have any travel planned two to four weeks from now, Nastro says postponing the trip is worth considering if the shutdown persists. She also recommended rescheduling trips to national parks.“Trash in parks-- just safety risks for people exploring and not really having anyone-- not having park staff to accommodate them if there's an emergency,” Nastro said. \"There can really be risks to attempting to go through a national park that isn't well-staffed.” ; }).then();",

Coins recovered from 1715 shipwreck off Treasure Coast The Treasure Fleet Shipwreck occurred on July 31, 1715, where an estimated $400 million worth of gold, silver and jewels were lost in the disaster. The fleet was transporting New World riches back to Spain at the time of the wreck. It has been marked as one of the greatest maritime tragedies of the Americas.\"This discovery is not only about the treasure itself, but the stories it tells,\" said Sal Guttuso, Director of Operations.\"Each coin is a piece of history, a tangible link to the people who lived, worked, and sailed during the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire.
