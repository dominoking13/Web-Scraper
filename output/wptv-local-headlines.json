While the airport is not on the FAA’s reduction list, data shows 11 flights were delayed Saturday afternoon.“Getting out of Cincinnati was just so difficult,” said Palm Beach Gardens resident Ron Davis. “I was delayed for several hours.”Davis is a frequent flyer and said it’s been a difficult week. Hundreds of passengers arriving from New York also experienced delays.“We’re just on the runway probably for like an hour or so,” said traveler Aly Ignasiak. “It stinks because like you feel bad for all the workers that are not being paid right now.”According to FlightAware, 14 flights were cancelled at PBIA between Friday evening to Saturday evening. Other flyers were bracing for setbacks, but in some cases, solutions were found.“I thought I was very lucky that they found another route,” said traveler Peter Martin, whose flight was initially delayed for more than three hours. “JetBlue found another route to get us home.”With the holiday travel just weeks away, many travelers are hoping things return to normal soon.“It’ll be interesting to see what happens but I fly back next week, so hopefully all this is done by then,” said Ignasiak.",

However, the company told the Florida Department of Commerce it now plans to close their West Palm Beach office in a WARN letter released earlier this week. It’s unclear if any of the additional employees were hired as promised.“We were aware we were losing money,” said one employee who sat in meeting with management that were keeping anonymous due to professional reputation in the industry. “…In meetings toward the beginning of the year. We were told that we had to, you know, break even by a certain part that year.”This employee said management made statements about the company’s financial restraints, which was openly discussed in the office as “the rapture,” similar to a trend on social media about the end of the world. The employee then said the company didn’t make payroll.“Everybody was sorta like staring at each other, like this might be it,” the employee said.This employee said he was laid off on Nov. 3, which was the day the company said it expected layoffs to begin in their letter to the Florida Department of Commerce. The letter said the company planed to end 141 jobs by the end of the year, a majority would get cut around the end of October.WATCH BELOW: Fintech firm MyBambu expands in West Palm Beach, eyes 200 new jobs Fintech firm MyBambu expands in West Palm Beach, eyes 200 new jobs Ryan Barack said if more than 100 employees are being laid off the company is required by law to notify its workers and the government about its plan 60 days before terminations start. He said there are some exceptions for sudden unforeseen circumstances and if there’s a reasonable chance of receiving outside capital from investors to save the company.Barack said he believes the company is trying to cite those exceptions in the letter because the company said it is “providing this notice as soon as practicable” along with touching on possible attempts at receiving outside investment. However, he said he would recommend employees talk with counsel to learn about their legal options.“It depends on what the facts are,” Barack said. “The magical phrase doesn’t get you there. It whether or not you were in fact not able to see these circumstances were going to happen.”MyBambu said it’s working on stabilizing its operations and it won’t reveal how many employees the company has laid off. However, the company said its deeply concerned about ongoing reporting about the company in a statement: “We are deeply concerned that ongoing reporting based on speculation and unverified claims could jeopardize our current funding efforts and, in turn, the livelihoods of our employees and the trust of the customers we proudly serve,” texted a company spokesperson. “We respectfully ask that accuracy and fairness guide any reporting moving forward, as the consequences of misinformation extend beyond headlines—they directly affect real people and families who depend on this company’s continued success.”",

By: Kayla McDermott Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The Federal Aviation Administration began cutting hundreds of daily flights as the historic government shutdown continues, causing thousands of delays and hundreds of cancellations nationwide. On Friday, nearly 20,000 flights were delayed with at least 1,400 cancellations across the country, according to FlightAware.WATCH BELOW: Florida lawmakers share thoughts on reduced flight, ongoing shutdown Florida lawmakers share thoughts on reduced flights, ongoing government shutdown Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that restrictions could increase next week as staffing shortages create safety concerns. \"It is not a science, it is an art that we're trying to deploy to keep people safe in the airspace, and we're trying to be trying to prevent the pressure that we now see building in the system,\" Duffy said.The FAA is grounding 10% of flights at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, New York, Atlanta and Charlotte.Government workers in air traffic control and TSA are working without pay during the shutdown, leading to further delays as they struggle to make it into work. TSA Officer William Watts expressed the financial strain many federal employees are facing. \"I'm not getting paid, so I can't come to work,\" Watts said.Richard Y. Newton III, a decorated military general who served in the United States Air Force for 34 years and was active during two previous government shutdowns, emphasized that safety remains the top priority. \"The first most important thing, though, is the safety of those air passengers,\" Newton said. He described the challenges of operating during a shutdown as \"extraordinary, challenging\" because \"we didn't have a budget, we couldn't really plan day to day or even week to week.\" National Politics Senate Republicans reject proposal to reopen government, extend ACA tax credits Nathaniel Reed U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., defended his party's position on the shutdown, stating that Republicans voted to fund the government. WPTV asked him about the GOP's responsibility for the ongoing shutdown.\"None whatsoever. Again, I'll say it in this way. Brian Mast voted to fund the government,\" Mast said.Mast acknowledged the severity of aviation safety concerns.\"There's no off-ramp in the sky. Things go wrong, and it's life or death,\" Mast said. However, the shutdown is also affecting veterans' services, according to Mast. \"It's a really big deal for our veterans. Their benefits continue to come. But there are some people that work in the Veterans Health Administration, the veterans hospitals, that they're not getting their paychecks,\" Mast said.We contacted U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla., on the issue, who was at the airport in Washington, D.C., trying to reach colleagues on Capitol Hill. \"The Capitol was empty. It was just me,\" Frankel said. Frankel criticized House leadership for the extended recess during the crisis. \"It's an embarrassment and a disgrace that our Speaker of the House has sent us away for seven weeks,\" Frankel said.Frankel disputed Republican claims about funding the government, arguing their approach would harm Florida residents. \"When they say they voted to fund the government. Now, here's what they did. They voted to throw millions of Floridians off their health care, including hundreds of thousands of veterans. And so it's a misnomer for them to say they voted to fund the government. They voted to fund it the way they want to fund it. We've been out now for seven weeks. It's a disgrace,\" Frankel said.Both lawmakers agreed that cooperation is necessary to end the shutdown. \"Always, you have to come to the table and end it,\" Mast said. \"We need to just be responsible people and sit down and talk it out,\" Frankel said.Newton expressed hope for a resolution that prioritizes the American people. \"My hope is that the Senate and the House will get together, they'll decide on unifying this case for the good of the American people,\" Newton said.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
