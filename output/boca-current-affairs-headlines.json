    "content": "At the November 17 and 18 City Council meetings, City staff, along with representatives from Terra & Frisbie Group and CBRE, the City’s real estate consultant for the project, presented on the following areas of the project (click on the tabs below). The new conceptual plan proposes that all property west of NW 2nd Avenue remains City-owned and designated for public, civic, and recreational uses: The area identified for potential private development consists of 7.72 acres east of NW 2nd Avenue near the Brightline station, with plans for residential, retail, commercial, and hotel uses: CBRE presented the financial analysis for the City Hall Campus Master Plan. As part of the proposed project, the City would lease 7.72 acres east of NW 2nd Avenue to Terra & Frisbie Group for 99-years. In exchange, the City would receive annual rent, tax revenue, and new public facilities. Estimated Financial Benefit: Over the course of the 99-year lease, total revenue is projected to exceed $4.1 billion. When adjusted to reflect today’s value (accounting for inflation and risk using a 4.5% discount rate), this equates to a net financial benefit of approximately $353.8 million. Cost of Public Improvements: The estimated budget to build the new government campus facilities on the west side of the site is $198.99 million. *The cost estimates for the public facilities are benchmarked against similar recent public projects in other Florida cities. Learn more about how the numbers were estimated by viewing the presentation (page 10). Additional analyses currently underway.

Through a public-private partnership, this project will revitalize the area by modernizing City Hall services, which are currently housed in outdated facilities, and relocating and improving recreational amenities. The vision is to create a vibrant, mixed-use civic hub that embodies a true “live, work, play” lifestyle. By integrating government services with residential, retail, and recreational spaces, the redevelopment will foster a dynamic, interconnected community. This project will transform the City Hall Campus into a modern urban center that supports both civic engagement and long-term growth. Discussions about a new Government Campus started around 2017. While some designs were presented to the City Council, the project didn’t move forward at that time. In recent years, the City has made redeveloping the City Hall Campus a priority. We understand and appreciate that residents care deeply about Boca Raton’s future and that meaningful discussion is part of what makes our community strong. However, some information circulating about current City projects and business has been incomplete or inaccurate. The following documents provide clear, factual information directly from the City about current projects, City business, initiatives and decisions. Many of these topics have already been discussed and addressed in public meetings, but we know not everyone can follow every update. Our goal is to make sure residents always have accurate information to form opinions based on facts. Click on a category below for information related to that topic. Questions?

At the October 28 meeting, City Council unanimously approved two resolutions placing those measures on the January 13, 2026, special election ballot. The proposed language reads: “The City Council shall not in any manner alienate from the public, lease or sell any land that is owned by the City of Boca Raton greater than one-half (0.5) acre, or any part thereof, except upon approval of the proposed action at a referendum election.” View the October 28 discussion from the beginning with staff updates. View the discussion related to the petitions and petition language. In March 2026, City of Boca Raton residents may see multiple ballot questions in relation to this project. Each question is different in scope and purpose. Here's what they mean: At the September 9 City Council Meeting, Council directed staff to prepare a referendum question to be placed on the March 10, 2025 Municipal Election Ballot about the proposed public-private partnership (P3) with Boca Raton City Center, LLC. (Terra & Frisbie Group). At the December 2, 2025 City Council Meeting, Council will review and consider the specific language related to this project.

    "headline": "Boca Raton’s Centennial Comes Alive in Ode to Boca Mural",
    "content": "The City of Boca Raton has unveiled Ode to Boca, a vibrant new mural by local artist Brian Butler, now featured on the stage doors of the Mizner Park Amphitheater in celebration of the City’s Centennial. The mural reflects the stories, people, and experiences that have shaped Boca Raton over the past 100 years. Inspired by poems and reflections submitted through the City’s Ode to Boca initiative, the artwork blends community voices with Butler’s signature narrative style, creating a welcoming centerpiece in Downtown Boca. The mural depicts Boca Raton’s natural and cultural landmarks—from beaches and the Intracoastal Waterway to local wildlife and historic architecture—offering a layered visual story of the City’s past, present, and future. The project was revealed during a community celebration with remarks from City officials, a meet-and-greet with the artist, Poems on Demand by O, Miami, and displays of community-submitted verses. The Amphitheater’s stage doors are transformed into a large-scale expression of community storytelling, blending public art, poetry, and place. Inspired by local Odes to Boca, five- line poems from residents, business owners, and visitors about their personal connections to the City, the mural reflects Boca Raton’s collective voice — past, present, and future. Building on this outpouring of community expression, survey responses on the final artist’s vision statements also helped guide the direction of the project and the selection of the commissioned artist. South Florida artist Brian Butler brings a playful, narrative-driven style to this mural, with the artwork capturing a century of Boca Raton through signature architecture, beaches, and iconic local moments. Butler’s composition blends natural and cultural elements — a sunbather and sea turtle, a ship passing under the bridge, and memories of early Boca Raton alongside scenes of daily life today. It’s warm, restrained palette complements the surrounding downtown environment, and layered details invite visitors to explore the city’s history at both a glance and up close. Learn more about the Ode to Boca initiative, in partnership with O, Miami and submit YOUR Ode to Boca today.",

    "content": "As part of the March 10, 2026 election, City of Boca Raton voters will be asked to vote for or against a $175 million general obligation bond in order to construct a new Police Department Headquarters. This webpage provides background information, details of the proposed project, and financing facts to help residents make an informed decision. If you're interested in having City and Police Department representatives speak to your group about the Police Department Headquarters Referendum appearing on the March 2026 municipal ballot please fill out this form. The presentation is informational only and will provide a factual overview including background information, details of the proposed project, and financing facts to help residents make an informed decision. Boca Raton’s Police Department Headquarters was built nearly 40 years ago to serve a much smaller community. Since then, the City has expanded westward, grown in population, and become a hub for students, businesses, and visitors, shifting the population center and increasing service demands. The current headquarters located at 100 NW Boca Raton Blvd, is not hurricane-rated, does not currently provide enough space for all staff and equipment, has limited space for future expansion, and is not built to current standards. In 2007, a space needs study was conducted that identified options for an improved and expanded headquarters to meet the City's projected future public safety needs, prompting the project to be added into the City’s Capital Improvement Program. A new headquarters is being proposed at a site on Spanish River Blvd near I-95. If approved, this project will: *Note: The project will not inhibit the multi-use path around Blue Lake.

    "headline": "Sustainability Matters Newsletter Holiday Edition!",
    "content": "To read this newsletter in your browser, find it on the City's website. Dear Sustainability Champions, As we head into the holiday season, there’s much to be thankful for — and even more to celebrate when it comes to sustainability in Boca Raton! Over the past few months, our community has achieved several impressive milestones that highlight our shared commitment to protecting our environment and advancing the City’s sustainability goals. On October 27, the City proudly accepted its LEED for Cities Gold Certification, recognizing Boca Raton’s leadership in energy efficiency, waste reduction, innovation, and overall quality of life. Residents have also stepped up in meaningful ways: through the Unwrap the Waves program with Loggerhead Marinelife Center, we collected 11,550 Halloween candy wrappers citywide for recycling. Our Intracoastal Cleanup on November 6 brought together 21 volunteers, who paddled and walked along the shoreline of Rutherford Park to remove 109 pounds of trash and recyclables. Within this issue you’ll also find important information on how to green your holidays with sustainable tips — from reducing Thanksgiving food waste to curbing excessive gift purchases. I want to offer my sincerest thanks to our residents who continue to encourage and support the sustainability initiatives of our beautiful city. Your level of engagement is contagious and motivating, and I look forward to carrying that into the New Year. Until then, wishing you and yours a blessed Thanksgiving and a very joyful holiday season! Sustainability Manager, City of Boca Raton Sustainable Thanksgiving: Tips for Keeping the Feast, But Reducing the Waste Nationwide, an estimated 300+ million pounds of food are wasted on Thanksgiving alone. Reducing even a small slice of that waste locally makes a measurable climate and community impact. Sustainable Holidays: Gifts, Lights, Trees, & Celebrations with a Lighter Footprint Household waste can spike substantially during the holiday season (analyses show roughly a 20–25% increase in household trash in December over other months). Lighting is also a meaningful part of seasonal electricity use — but switching to LEDs cuts holiday lighting energy by ~70–85% compared to incandescent bulbs. Reducing physical waste and utilizing more efficient lighting can make big differences in reducing your holiday footprint. The City's Christmas tree recycling program will run from Dec. 26, 2025 through Jan. 19, 2026. Residents can drop off their “clean” Christmas trees (remove all lights & decorations) at Countess de Hoernle Park (1000 Spanish River Blvd, southern end of the parking lot next to the maintenance area). Recreation Services will pick up the trees and chip them into mulch to be used at the Gumbo Limbo Nature Center. An Otterly Abundant Thanksgiving! On November 2, two playful North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) were spotted in the Lake Worth Drainage District E-3 Canal near the intersection of South Military Trail and Verde Trail South. This species is found throughout the state (where it is the only native otter) and inhabits freshwater rivers, lakes, marshes, and coastal estuaries. The otters tend to avoid heavily urbanized or polluted waterways, so their presence may be a good sign for the E-3 Canal water quality! Adult river otters typically reach 3-4 feet long (with a strong and tapered tail that acts like a rudder when swimming) and weigh 10-25 pounds, though males can reach up to 30 pounds. The two otters viewed in the E-3 were certainly pushing to reach that maximum weight as they made a feast of apple snails from the canal. There were at least a dozen empty shells strewn across the canal bank in the vicinity of the otters. What a delicious and nutritious pre-Thanksgiving meal! This was a fantastic opportunity to be able to view these adorable and inquisitive animals. Be warned, however, otters are highly intelligent and can be aggressive if threatened. They are wild carnivores, so treat them as such and enjoy them safely from a distance if you happen to see them. They will probably be just as interested in seeing you! Update on the Children's Science Explorium Chickee Hut In our last newsletter, you saw the ongoing progress to clear weeds from around the Children’s Science Explorium’s new Chickee hut in preparation for planting a native landscape. On October 28, the vision was completed when a team from the Explorium working with Woodly and Jean from the City’s maintenance team installed over 95 native plants including southern shield ferns, coontie, cocoplum, wild coffee, muhly grass and more! Make sure to stop by frequently and watch as the plants fill in the space, and stay tuned to City outreach to find out about events that will soon be offered in the Chickee hut! Sustainability Heroes Thank you to Nancy and Daphna from Boca Raton Garden Club (BRGC) for refreshing the four planters on the Spanish River Library footbridge. In addition to fresh soil and mulch, new bromeliads were installed and a native coontie was replaced. The planters are a collaboration between BRGC and HABcenter nursery (who supplies the planting materials). These dedicated partners beautify the landscape for all those enjoying the trail around Spanish River Library and Pondhawk Natural Area. Check it out on your next visit and appreciate Nancy and Daphna’s green thumbs! A big thanks to students, teachers, staff and the PTA of Verde Elementary School for collecting over 9,700 wrappers which made up about 84% of the City’s entire collection for Loggerhead Marinelife Center’s Unwrap the Waves candy wrapper recycling program. Thank you for keeping this source of plastic from reaching our ecosystems! (We collected 11,550 wrappers in total this year!) Well done citizen scientists! You can be a Citizen Scientist anytime! At Spanish River Library, stop by the Check Out desk and ask to borrow a Citizen Science Kit. The Citizen Science Kits are designed to help adults and older children participate in the scientific process, to address societal needs and accelerate science, technology and innovation. The kits provide the opportunity to conduct experiments, collect data, interpret results, make new discoveries, and crowdsource.
