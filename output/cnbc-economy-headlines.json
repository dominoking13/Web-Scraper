    "headline": "September jobs report will be out Thursday as first data since shutdown starts to trickle out",
    "content": "The first economic data report that went unreleased due to the government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. As the U.S. government reopens for business, Wall Street's attention now turns toward when critical data on employment, inflation and other economic signposts will be released. The first such report, on September nonfarm payrolls, will come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., according to a BLS update posted on its website. A day later, the BLS will release real earnings, a companion report to the monthly consumer price index that did not come out simultaneously in October because average earnings earnings, which are part of the payrolls report, were not released. Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings. In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits. Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate. That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate. The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon. Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors. \"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\" The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out. For instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that. A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\" In the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.com Citing precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\" \"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\" White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. Since Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released. \"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\" Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing. Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers. Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points. Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases.

    "headline": "Trump tariffs help push U.S. beef prices higher",
    "content": "President Donald Trump is blaming the meat packers and U.S. cattlemen for rising beef prices, but the tariffs on beef from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, feed, farm equipment and machinery are all adding to the price surge. The United States is a big buyer of Australian, Brazilian, and New Zealand beef exports. Brazil is the second-largest beef-producing country and the largest beef-exporting country in the world. Brazilian beef exports tracked by Panjiva plummeted in July and August after multiple tariffs resulted in a layered 76.4% total rate being implemented for Brazilian beef. Trump imposed a 50% tariff rate for many Brazilian goods in July. Beef exports have found a new home, being diverted to other markets like China. Exports of beef from Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay to the U.S. have also decreased as a result of tariffs. The pullback in exports has reduced supply and is adding to pressures in an already tight U.S. beef supply chain. \"When you impose an extra 50% tariff on a major supplier like Brazil, importers may keep buying and pass costs along, or they may stop buying, but that means less supply to meet the demand,\" said Dan Anthony, president of economic research firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. \"Either way, you expect prices to go up, especially when imports from Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, and other key suppliers face new tariffs too,\" he added. The most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of September showed prices for a variety of uncooked beef products rising year over year between 12% and 18%. The compounding effect of tariffs comes at a time when the U.S. cattle herd is at near a 75-year low, and consumer demand for beef has grown. Cattle ranchers have had difficulties increasing the herd because of drought, which has diminished the amount of grasslands to feed their herds, and the higher costs in buying feed. Some imported fertilizers have faced double-digit tariffs, which have raised the cost of growing the crops (corn, soybeans) that are used in animal feed. Tariffs on essential items like steel and aluminum have also increased the cost of farm equipment (tractors, grain bins) and repairs. All of these added expenses carve out money from the coffers of ranchers and farmers that would be used for investing back into their operations. \"We're in one of the toughest cattle cycles in history,\" said sixth-generation Texas rancher James Clement III. \"We have the smallest pipeline of future cattle and even with today's prices, ranchers can't speed up the process to rebuild the national herd, which will take time, grass, and rain,\" he said. Replacement heifers are down to a 20-year low. Ranchers say it takes years to see a return on buying heifers. \"The fundamentals are tight, the runway is long, and the slightest shock makes an already fragile rebuild even harder,\" Clement said. \"This is a foreign concept to many other industries where production can be ramped up or down in weeks,\" he added. One of the biggest headwinds curtailing investment is the current political environment. \"Producers start second-guessing whether to hold back heifers or take the money today because uncertainty adds risk to ranchers wanting to retain or purchase heifers to rebuild their herds,\" Clement said. President Trump added to frustration among ranchers when he announced as part of a deal with Argentina in October having the country export beef into the United States to help lower beef prices, which the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said would harm rural America, comments that helped to sink the price of cattle futures. \"We don't need Argentine beef because the U.S. already produces more high-quality beef than ever before,\" Clement said. \"The expanded Argentine quota entering our market, it would amount to less than half of one percent, about one extra hamburger per person, nowhere near enough to move the needle,\" he said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently acknowledged the dwindling herd numbers and announced a series of initiatives it hopes will encourage people to become cattlemen. The White House has become more focused on its affordability messaging in recent days after key GOP election losses around the country and Trump administration officials have said policies are coming to lower prices on some grocery staples not grown in the U.S. A group of coffee and banana-producing countries including Ecuador and Guatemala were included in a tariff removal plan the government said it had reached on Thursday. \"It's politically easy to slap tariffs on foreign competitors to defend domestic producers but the consumer usually ends up paying the cost,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. \"Demand then shrinks, they eat chicken instead and the domestic producers end up no better off,\" he said. While there are many ranchers sitting on the sidelines waiting for better economic conditions and incentives to grow their herds, Clement is investing in his ranch and is continuing to buy heifers to grow his operation. \"Cattle are a great long-term investment and ranching is a great life,\" he said. In addition to climate and feed costs, U.S. cattle ranchers are concerned about the possible return of the New World Screwworm. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins led the largest USDA trade mission to Mexico to discuss measures for combating NWS. The parasitic fly lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae then hatches from the eggs and burrows into tissue of animals to feed on them. If caught early, the sick animal can be treated and survive. Human cases are rare but can be painful and require medical attention. This parasite was successfully eradicated from the United States in 1966, but some cattle in Mexico have been found infected with the parasite and all Mexican beef imports have been shuttered. All of these supply chain challenges have added to the pressure on beef prices. \"We will adapt to market changes and New World Screwworm as ranchers have always done, by staying steady and calm in the face of all of the challenges that ranchers have always faced,\" Clement said.

    "headline": "Atlanta Fed President Bostic says he'll leave position when his term expires in February",
    "content": "Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he will be leaving his position when his term expires in February. Bostic has been in his current role since June 2017 and is the first Black and openly gay regional president. His term, which also was marked by issues relating to personal investments he made, runs until Feb. 28. \"I'm proud of what we accomplished during my tenure to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality, and I look forward to discovering new ways to advance that bold vision in my next chapter,\" Bostic said in a statement. The announcement comes ahead of a pivotal year for the Fed and its rate-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee. Regional presidents serve five-year terms that generally run in sync and are designed to expire on years that end in either 1 or 6, which will be the case next year. While the local boards vote on the presidents, they are subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. Normally a routine process, unusual political dynamics on the board could add a new wrinkle to the procedure. In addition to the reappointments of the regional presidents, Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, though his run as governor goes until 2028. Bostic has been seen as more of a centrist during his run, though he's been more cautious about cutting interest rates this year during a time of elevated inflation and a softening labor market. He is not an FOMC voter this year. Atlanta next will get a vote in 2027. Powell said Bostic's \"perspective has enriched the Federal Open Market Committee's understanding of our dynamic economy. And his steady voice has exemplified the best of public service — grounded in analysis, informed by experience, and guided by purpose.\" Until the board names a successor, Cheryl Venable, the first vice president and chief operating officer at the Atlanta Fed, will handle the role of president. Bostic's term has not been without controversy. In October 2022, the Fed announced it was looking at trades Bostic made during blackout periods near policy meetings. An internal report showed there were 154 trades made on his behalf during those times. However, the report also indicated there was no evidence Bostic traded on insider information or had personal conflicts. There also were other issues raised regarding financial disclosure terms and an improper level of Treasury holdings. For his part, Bostic expressed regret over the discrepancies and said the trades were executed by third-party managers over whom he did not have control. The controversy was part of a larger issue with investments from Fed officials that triggered tighter internal controls and rules over what types of securities they are permitted to hold.

    "headline": "The shutdown put jobs and inflation data on hold. Here's when it could be back",
    "content": "Economic data releases that have lagged during the government shutdown likely will take some time to get rolling again once Congress is back in business. The reopening could happen as soon as the end of this week once final votes take place and President Donald Trump signs a stop-gap spending bill into law. From there, though, it will take the various agencies, primarily in the departments of Labor and Commerce, to get up and rolling again as it regards data collection and releases. That means likely having to play catch-up for key reports like nonfarm payrolls, the consumer price index, retail sales, spending and income, and a variety of other metrics. \"The shutdown of the federal government has delayed nearly all federal economic data releases for September and October,\" Goldman Sachs economists Elsie Peng and Ronnie Walker said in a client note. \"While the shutdown appears to be nearing its end, it will take time for the statistical agencies to work through the backlog of releases.\" Assuming the government reopens before the end of the week, Goldman figures the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will put out an updated schedule of releases in the early part of next week. The BLS is in charge of the payrolls report as well as the CPI and the producer price index, both of which were scheduled for release this week. Other reports from the bureau include import and export prices, the employment cost index, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Goldman's economists expect the October jobs report to be released soon after the reopening, possibly next Tuesday or Wednesday. \"But apart from that, we expect other major data releases to be delayed,\" they said. That means the November payrolls and inflation reports could be delayed by \"at least a week,\" Goldman said. For Commerce, among the more relevant reports are personal spending and income, which also includes the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Outside of that, there's retail sales, durable goods and the quarterly gross domestic product reading. When the data freeze ends, the reports are likely to show more of the same as far as the economy goes — a slowing labor market, inflation still holding above the Fed's comfort level and broader growth positive but also not gangbusters. Fed officials have noted the inconvenience of not having regular data reports. But Chair Jerome Powell said recently that alternative data shows the central bank really hasn't missed much in terms of the macro picture. \"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public- and private-sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" Powell said at an Oct. 29 news conference. \"Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.\" Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting the October nonfarm payrolls report to show a loss of 60,000 jobs. While Goldman puts the decline at 50,000, the general tenor of data for the month points to a slowdown. Powell said Fed estimates put the key inflation rate at 2.8% for September, which is still considerably above the central bank's 2% target but expected to decelerate gradually through 2026. The official PCE report is scheduled to drop Nov. 26, and it is unknown whether that will be the case. As for the broader economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker of incoming data puts third-quarter growth at a 4% rate. Goldman projects fourth-quarter growth of 1.3%, an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point from the prior forecast, putting the full year on pace for a 2% annualized gain.

    "headline": "'Ghost job' postings add another layer of uncertainty to stalled jobs picture",
    "content": "Judging by current data, you'd think there's literally a job out there for anyone who wants one. Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story. The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers. But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled. Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. That points to an ongoing problem with \"ghost jobs\" that never seem to get filled. \"The U.S. labor market looks deceptively strong on paper. Millions of openings suggest opportunity, but many are illusions,\" said Jasmine Escalera, career expert at MyPerfectResume, an employment assistance platform that released a report this week on the shadow employment market. \"The ghost job economy inflates hope, wastes job seekers' time and clouds the data [that] policymakers rely on to steer the economy.\" Job openings have generally been on the decline since peaking above 12 million in March 2022, when opportunities outnumbered available workers by better than 2 to 1. In August, the latest month for which data is available because of the government shutdown, openings totaled more than 7.2 million while hires were just 5.1 million. The ratio of vacancies to workers was about even. To be sure, the picture isn't as simple as comparing the two numbers. The postings number represents the total stock of jobs, while hirings are the flow of people hired during a particular month. So a job can get posted across multiple months without being filled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the companies advertising those positions don't intend to hire someone. Moreover, some companies will post jobs just to keep an inventory of potential workers for positions that may open in the future. Finally, the openings-to-hire ratio has fallen over the past few years, from 1.8 to 1 at the peak of the job opening cycle to the current level around 1.4 to 1, indicating fewer \"ghost jobs\" out there. One issue affecting the gap: the changing labor pool as the U.S. has tightened its immigration standards. Small business owners report the toughest time filling open positions since the Covid pandemic while noting that 88% of applicants for jobs lack the required skills, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report Tuesday. However, the issue has drawn more serious attention in recent months as the labor market has begun moderating and net hiring has slowed to a crawl. At the same time, official government data is unavailable due to the shutdown in Washington, D.C. Job seekers have become frustrated at not being able to find new positions. Mobility has decelerated, with the \"quits rate\" falling more than 30% from that March 2022 peak of job openings, during what was called the \"Great Resignation.\" A petition on Change.org seeking to clamp down on companies advertising ghost jobs has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures. There are real impacts on a policy level: Federal Reserve officials watch BLS job openings numbers closely for clues about how tight the labor market is, so having unreliable data clouds their vision. \"For job seekers, that means wasted time. For policymakers, it means distorted data. For employers, it raises serious credibility issues,\" Escalera said. \"Until postings more accurately reflect actual hiring, workers will continue to chase jobs that don't exist, and trust in the labor market will erode.\" Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "Stocks are buoying wealthy economic sentiment. A labor market break could end that",
    "content": "As stock market investors support economic sentiment, some economists wonder if a looser labor market could pull the rug out. The University of Michigan's widely-followed consumer sentiment index slid more than 6% in November, nearing all-time lows and down about 30% from a year ago. Respondents were concerned that the long-running federal government shutdown would drag on the economy, according to survey director Joanne Hsu. But at least one group bucked the sour mood: Those with the most stock holdings. The individuals with sizable stock market wealth reported an 11% improvement in sentiment, which Hsu tied to the stock market's recent rally to all-time highs. Conventional wisdom is that wealthier consumers will keep spending as long as they feel good about their own circumstances and see their investments growing, bolstering the economy and corporate profits. But now other economists are concerned that federal labor data, once it resumes, may paint a darker picture of the economy and catalyze a market sell-off that would throw cold water on rosy outlooks. \"It comes down to the labor market,\" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust. \"If you start getting negative job prints, the jig is up.\" Economists told CNBC that the stock market is behaving as if the economy is \"K\"-shaped, with the best-off thriving while the lower end struggles. Investors are counting on the higher-end of the \"K\" continuing to fare well and spending part of their discretionary income. The group's resilience even in the face of high tariffs this year and the brief April swoon in stocks has eased concern about the likelihood of the economy tipping into a recession anytime soon. RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas, for example, said that while he doesn't expect top end consumers to crack and cause a recession, the Michigan survey data underscores \"severe market stress\" on lower-end consumers that don't own stocks and aren't benefiting from the artificial intelligence trade. \"Elevated equity valuations partially mask the ongoing structural transformation of the economy down market — that does not favor those who work in traditional industries,\" Brusuelas said. \"It points to [a] very highly segmented economy with different realities based on which economic decile you live in.\" In other words, how much money you make and how many investments you hold. The best-off consumers also likely benefit from rising home prices on their properties and, in many instances, low mortgage rates obtained during the Covid pandemic, according to Jeffrey Roach, LPL Financial's chief economist. That is yet another cause for optimism in this group — even if this year's stock market rally loses steam, he said. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed more than 16% in 2025, excluding dividends, and is on track for its third straight winning year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped nearly 22%, underscoring continued excitement around AI. Roach said the expected business benefits from President Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" justify some market froth, and the promise of profits from AI can lure investors into buying stocks with high valuations. How long the economy will continue to depend on the top cohort of consumers may come down to the state of the labor market, Roach said. With less immigration under the Trump administration, it may become easier to return to the workforce, as long as demand holds up. That in turn can drive up household incomes and help the economy sidestep a possible recession down the road, Roach added. But Tilley of M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust said warning signs are flashing. Among them, data showing small businesses shrinking payrolls. Even before the government shutdown suspended the latest jobs reports, it seemed like nonfarm payrolls were showing signs of weakness. If employment softens, it will be harder for investors to bank on the top end of the \"K\"-shaped economy holding firm. The idea that wealthy consumers can single-handedly prop up demand feels \"reverse engineered\" to rationalize why the stock market has jumped to records despite uncertainty in the job market, said Tilley, an economic adviser to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve for almost six years before joining Wilmington Trust. \"History shows: You start getting negative job prints, the economy and the market are going to come right after that,\" Tilley said. \"We're 100% focused on the labor market, and we see a lot of chinks in the armor there.\" Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "Nexperia parent shares jump 6% as Beijing signals thaw in tensions with Netherlands",
    "content": "Shares of Wingtech Technology, parent company of chipmaker Nexperia, extended gains on Monday after Beijing agreed to further talks with a Dutch delegation, easing concerns about a global auto supply crunch. Shanghai-listed Wingtech Technology saw its shares jump as much as 6.4% on Monday, according to LSEG data, after surging 9.7% in the final minutes of trading last Friday on signs of de-escalation in a battle over control of the Dutch-based Nexperia. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had taken steps to allow exports of certain chips from Nexperia's China facility, while urging the European Union to press the Dutch government to lift restrictions on the firm. In a separate statement on Saturday, Beijing said that it has agreed to the Dutch government's request to send representatives to Beijing for talks, and that it hoped the Netherlands would propose \"constructive solutions\" and take \"concrete actions\" to resolve the dispute over Nexperia soon. The move followed a statement from Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans last Thursday, which suggested Nexperia chips would reach customers in Europe and beyond in the coming days, citing \"the constructive nature of our talks with the Chinese authorities.\" China and the U.S. had informed the Netherlands that the trade deal they struck last month would result in the resumption of supplies from Nexperia's facilities in China, Karremans said. \"This is also consistent with information provided by the European Commission by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,\" he added. The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia on Sept. 30, citing security concerns that the company would shift its operations to China, where its parent company Wingtech is based, prompting Beijing to retaliate by blocking exports of components from Nexperia's Chinese facility. The dispute over the ownership and control of the Dutch-based Nexperia led to worries of a global shortage of the chips widely used in industrial, computing, mobile and consumer products. Carmakers like Volkswagen warned of possible production risks, while Honda slashed its annual profit forecast after halting production at several plants. Other major automakers, including Stellantis, said they were monitoring the situation around the clock, setting up \"war rooms\" to explore alternative purchasing methods to mitigate disruptions. The recent escalation of the dispute over Nexperia was the \"direct result\" of Beijing's simmering tensions with the U.S., said Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI. Washington in late September expanded its entity list — a U.S. trade blacklist for companies seen as security or foreign policy risks — to include subsidiaries that are 50% or more owned by firms already on the list. Nexperia is one such subsidiary of Zhejiang-based communications equipment manufacturer Wingtech Technology Co., which was added to the list in December last year, Wang said. Following a trade truce struck between Beijing and Washington on Oct. 30, which led both sides to scale back some restrictions, China said earlier this month that it would allow Nexperia's China unit to resume shipments to global customers. \"Beijing appeared unwilling to gamble with bilateral relations [with the Netherlands],\" Evercore’s Neo said, as the stakes are high given that the Dutch government controls ASML Holding, the world's top supplier of advanced chipmaking equipment. Because of its unique technology, ASML has been a key focus of U.S.-China tensions, with Washington pressuring The Hague to restrict exports to China. Suppliers have begun receiving chip shipments from China, according to a note on Saturday from a team of auto and mobility analysts led by Dan Levy at Barclays. However, the analysts warned that low chip inventories could still cause disruptions in the near term. They added that the relief appeared \"temporary,\" as the core dispute between Nexperia's Dutch headquarters and its China-based operation remains unresolved. Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "Consumer sentiment nears lowest level ever as worries build over shutdown",
    "content": "Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university's monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October's 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November's reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. Concerns about the ongoing impasse in Washington topped consumers' fears, outweighing a boost in sentiment from fresh record highs in stock prices, said Joanne Hsu, survey director . \"With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,\" Hsu said. \"This month's decline in sentiment was widespread throughout the population, seen across age, income, and political affiliation.\" Other measures in the survey painted a similar picture. The current conditions index slid to 52.3, a drop of nearly 11% from last month and the lowest in its history going back to 1951, while the future expectations measure fell to 49.0, down 2.6%. On a year-earlier basis, the two measures respectively slumped 18.2% and 36.3%. \"Across the economy, segments of the population are increasingly dealing with tighter financial conditions,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at consumer finance site NerdWallet. \"That's certainly true for federal workers and people dependent on food assistance from the federal government. But it's also likely increasingly true for middle income Americans.\" Measures of inflation held relatively in check, with a drop in the longer-term outlook. The outlook for one year from now nudged higher to 4.7%, while the five-year measure was at 3.6%, down 0.3 percentage point. With government economic data collection and releases suspended during the shutdown, measures like the Michigan sentiment survey loom larger as alternative measures of economic progress. As has been the case with other measures, the survey found some disparity in income levels and particularly by asset holdings. Hsu said sentiment among those with the largest stock holdings actually improved 11%. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "Chicago Fed's Goolsbee says he's cautious about further rate cuts during shutdown",
    "content": "Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Thursday expressed hesitation about lowering interest rates further because the government shutdown has resulted in a blackout on key inflation data. While Goolsbee has otherwise been an advocate for gradually lowering rates, the central bank official said during a CNBC interview that he has concerns over the lack of important price reports, particularly with general inflation recently trending higher. \"If there are problems developing on the inflation side, it's going to be a fair amount bit of time before we see that, where if it starts to deteriorate on the job market side, we're going to see that pretty much right away,\" Goolsbee said. \"So that makes me even more uneasy ... with front-loading rate cuts and counting on the inflation that we have seen in the last three months to just be transitory and assume that they're going to go away.\" Goolsbee spoke as the Chicago Fed updated its own dashboard of labor market indicators. The data set indicated a stable unemployment rate in October and a steady pace of hirings and layoffs. The Chicago Fed's unemployment rate indicator was at 4.36% for the month, up just one one-hundredth of a percentage point from September. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics won't release its consumer price index report for October, which had been scheduled for next week. The BLS did put out a report for September despite the shutdown, as that particular count is used for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. That report showed inflation running at a 3% annual rate, compared with the Fed's goal of 2%. Whether the Commerce Department releases its personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge, depends on getting the shutdown resolved. Goolsbee said the lack of inflation reports concerns him, as three-month trends before the shutdown showed core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, running at a 3.6% annualized pace. \"Medium-run, I'm not hawkish on rates. I believe that the settling point for rates is going to be a fair bit below where it is today,\" he said. \"When it's foggy, let's just be a little careful and slow down.\" Goolsbee will get a vote when the Federal Open Market Committee meets in December to decide whether to cut rates again following reductions at the prior two meetings. However, he will rotate to being an alternate in 2026 before returning to a voting role in 2027. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "Job cuts in October hit highest level for the month in 22 years, Challenger says",
    "content": "Layoff announcements soared in October as companies recalibrated staffing levels during the artificial intelligence boom, a sign of potential trouble ahead for the labor market, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Job cuts for the month totaled 153,074, a 183% surge from September and 175% higher than the same month a year ago. It was the highest level for any October since 2003. This has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009. \"Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at the firm. \"At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable.\" The report provides a glimpse into the labor market at a time when the government has suspended data gathering and releases during the shutdown in Washington, D.C. To be sure, the Challenger monthly numbers can be highly volatile, and an accelerated pace of layoffs has yet to show up in state-level weekly jobless claim filings that continue to come in despite the shutdown. Payrolls processing firm ADP reported that October saw net job growth of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector. However, the report comes at a time when Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern about a softening labor market. The central bank has lowered its benchmark interest rate twice since September and is expected to approve another quarter percentage point reduction in December as policymakers look to get ahead of any more serious problems. Challenger reports the highest level of layoffs coming from the technology sector amid a time of restructuring due to AI integration. Companies in the sector announced 33,281 cuts, nearly six times the level in September. Consumer products also saw a sharp gain to 3,409, while nonprofits, an area hit hard by the shutdown, listed 27,651 cuts year to date, up 419% from the same point in 2024. In total, companies have announced 1.1 million cuts this year, a 65% increase from a year ago and the highest level since the Covid pandemic year of 2020. October saw the highest total for any month in the fourth quarter since 2008. \"Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,\" Challenger said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.
