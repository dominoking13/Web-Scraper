    "headline": "Ukraine, trade, pandas: What China's Xi and France's Macron discussed in Beijing",
    "content": "China said it was open to importing more goods from France in exchange for a \"fair, conducive environment\" for Chinese businesses in the European nation, President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Thursday as they met in Beijing. The French president kicked off a 3-day visit to China on Wednesday — his first trip to Beijing in more than two years — on the heels of growing frictions over a range of topics including trade imbalance and the long-running war in Ukraine. In a separate readout from the French government, Macron told Xi that the two countries must work together based on \"a balanced relationship,\" while urging Beijing to help end the Russia-Ukraine war. Macron said he welcomed Beijing's \"renewed willingness to facilitate access to the Chinese market for French products, particularly agricultural goods,\" including wine, pork, poultry and beef, according to a Google translation of the statement in French. The countries will work toward establishing a framework that allows for increased Chinese direct investment in Europe, particularly in France, where it will create more jobs, Macron said. The two leaders also signed several deals covering energy, agriculture, education and environment, according to the official readout from Chinese state media, which did not elaborate on the agreed terms. Xi also called for deepening bilateral collaboration in aerospace, nuclear energy, digital economy, biopharmaceutical and artificial intelligence sectors. The readout reflects Paris' \"ambition to be a stabilizing force in EU-China relations,\" said Daniel Balazs, a research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, noting that the EU's broader aim would be to preserve constructive ties with China despite recurring frictions. \"Good ties with France also ensure that China has friends within the EU when Brussels makes economic and political decisions that impact Chinese interests,\" said Balazs. Tensions between Beijing and Paris escalated last year when Macron backed the European Union's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, prompting Beijing to retaliate with minimum price requirements on French cognac makers. Macron is expected to lobby the Chinese leader to not impose similar measures on French pork and dairy products, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, as Beijing has weighed those duties in response to the levies on EVs. Macron had also pushed Brussels to respond with its toughest trade measures on China after Beijing restricted its rare earth exports that had triggered worries of supply shortages at European carmakers. The bilateral meeting comes at a time when Beijing is locked in a diplomatic spat with Japan over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement that signaled a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could draw a military response from Japan. Without naming the democratically ruled island, China said Macron agreed to the \"one China policy\" — a diplomatic term commonly used to indicate Taiwan as part of China. The statement from French government did not mention Taiwan as part of the discussion. On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his French counterpart Jean-Noël Barrot that he hoped Paris to continue \"showing understanding for and supporting China's legitimate stance\" and prevent Japan from \"stirring up troubles\" over Taiwan. The Xi-Macron meeting \"provides a platform for top-level engagement [but] whether the problems can be solved is another question,\" said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit. A key goal of Macron's visit was expected to be on addressing what he's called \"global imbalances\" including over-production in China and Beijing's dependence on exports which he says leads to global trade imbalance. France's trade balance with China stood at nearly 20 billion euros (about $23 billion) in 2024. \"Macron can make his case for a partnership among equals to Xi Jinping. This includes opening China's wider market to European companies and possibly paving the way to some joint-ventures in Europe in not-so-sensitive domains,\" said Philippe Le Corre, senior fellow on foreign policy at New York-based Center for China Analysis. The two presidents exchanged views on the Ukraine war, with Xi saying that China will \"continue to play a constructive role in resolving the conflict and support European nations in pushing for a balanced, effective, and sustainable security framework.\" Macron has long been urging Xi to use his influence on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. \"I hope China will join our call and our efforts to achieve, as soon as possible, at the very least a cease-fire in the form of a moratorium on strikes targeting critical infrastructure,\" Macron said in a statement. This trip offers a rare chance to get Paris' views on Ukraine to a Chinese leadership which has been Russia's \"all-weather partner,\" especially since the war started in 2022, said CCA's Le Corre. After formal meetings in Beijing the two leaders will head to the southwestern city of Chengdu — home of China's giant panda breeding center. Last month, France returned a pair of loaned pandas to the Chinese city after 13 years, with their arrival being been hailed as a sign of warming diplomatic ties. The Chinese embassy promised new pandas would soon be dispatched to France. Xi, who emphasized on expanding cultural exchange between the two countries, said that China and France had agreed to a new deal on panda protection. — CNBC's Charlotte Reed contributed to this story.

    "headline": "Bessent says Trump admin can replicate tariffs even if it loses Supreme Court decision",
    "content": "NEW YORK — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday predicted that the administration still will be able to implement its tariff agenda regardless of whether it prevails in a pending case before the Supreme Court. Repeating assertions he had made prior to the high court hearing a month ago, Bessent cited several sections of 1962 Trade Act that give the president sweeping powers over import duties. \"We can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122,\" he said during an onstage interview at The New York Times DealBook Summit. Asked by host Andrew Ross Sorkin — the founding editor of DealBook and co-host of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" — whether the administration had to implement those measures permanently, Bessent replied, \"permanently.\" Section 122 allows for tariff power up to 150 days, but 301 and 232 are less definitive on a time frame. Bessent also cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as providing broad tariff authority, though that is the use under scrutiny by the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a favorite negotiating tool against U.S. trading partners. The president has slapped duties on a wide range of products and virtually all imports that come into the country, though he has backed off on many of the more aggressive measures. Bessent cited some of the successes the administration has enjoyed thus far, naming China specifically despite ongoing tensions between the two nations. \"Because of the fentanyl tariffs, the Chinese are making the first the step forward that they've made\" on trade, he said. Bessent added that China has made \"a robust effort\" at halting the drug's import into the U.S. He added that he still thinks the U.S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case. On a separate matter, Bessent dodged a question on Trump's pick for the next Federal Reserve chair and noted the limited power the central bank leader has over interest rates. Recent reports have indicated that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the front-runner. \"The important thing to remember here is that it's a board and [there are] several other voters from the from the regional banks,\" he said. \"The chair of the Federal Reserve has the ability to move and start the discussion, but at the end of the day ... he or she is one vote.\" Bessent told CNBC recently that he thought Trump could make the decision by Christmas, but the president indicated it may not come until the new year.

    "headline": "Private payrolls unexpectedly fell by 32,000 in November, ADP reports",
    "content": "The U.S. labor market slowdown intensified in November as private companies cut 32,000 workers, with small businesses hit the hardest, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday. With worries intensifying over the domestic jobs picture, ADP indicated the issues were worse than anticipated. The payrolls decline marked a sharp step down from October, which saw an upwardly revised gain of 47,000 positions, and was well below the Dow Jones consensus estimate from economists for an increase of 40,000. Larger businesses, entailing companies with 50 or more employees, actually reported a net gain of 90,000 workers. However, establishments with fewer than 50 workers saw a decline of 120,000, including a drop of 74,000 among firms with 20 to 49 employees. The total loss was the biggest drop since March 2023. Education and health services led gainers with 33,000 hires, while leisure and hospitality added 13,000. But a broad-based decline across industries drove the total lower. The biggest loss came in professional and business services, which saw a decline of 26,000. Others shedding jobs included information services (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial activities and construction, both of which saw losses of 9,000. The rate of pay also slowed, with workers staying in their jobs seeing a 4.4% year-over-year increase, down 0.1 percentage point from October. \"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. \"And while November's slowdown was broad-based, it was led by a pullback among small businesses.\" The ADP report is the last jobs picture the Federal Reserve gets before it meets Dec. 9-10. Futures traders are assigning a nearly 90% probability that the central bank will approve another quarter percentage point cut in its key interest rate, despite misgivings from some officials over whether further easing is needed. The probability was about the same following the ADP release. In recent weeks, Fed policymakers have expressed a divergence of opinions. One side sees cuts as necessary to head off further labor market troubles, while the other worries that additional reductions could aggravate inflation, which has held considerably above the Fed's 2% target. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its take on the nonfarm payrolls picture on Dec. 16, a date delayed because of the government shutdown. Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "Delayed tariff impact starting to hit, could cause reduced head count in 2026",
    "content": "President Donald Trump's tariffs, aimed at reshoring American jobs lost to overseas manufacturing, could end up lowering domestic head count instead, according to recent statements from corporate executives and economic forecasters. With the labor market already on its heels in a no-fire, no-hire climate, concerns are rising that the duties on U.S. imports will raise operating costs and force companies to start paring their employment rolls. For instance, respondents to the Institute for Supply Management's November survey of factory conditions expressed elevated levels of worry. \"We are starting to institute more permanent changes due to the tariff environment,\" one transportation equipment executive wrote. \"This includes reduction of staff, new guidance to shareholders, and development of additional offshore manufacturing that would have otherwise been for U.S. export.\" The ISM surveys do not identify respondents by name but rather by industry. Similar comments were found elsewhere in report, which showed that the ISM manufacturing index edged further into territory signaling a decline in business conditions. The headline reading of 48.2% represents the share of businesses reporting expansion, so anything below 50% is indicative of contraction. The survey's employment gauge fell 2 points to 44%, its lowest reading since August and consistent with the gradual but persistent trend of labor market softening. There were other signs that the labor picture is darkening heading into 2026. Trump has pushed hard for energy exploration and increased utilization of fossil fuels. But an ISM respondent from the petroleum and coal industry reported, \"No major changes at this time, but going into 2026, we expect to see big changes with cash flow and employee head count. The company has sold off a big part of the business that generated free cash while offering voluntary severance packages to anyone.\" One manager in the electrical equipment, appliances and components business said tariffs are causing a tougher business climate than during the Covid crisis. \"Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty,\" the respondent said. To be sure, broader economic conditions remain fairly stable. Third-quarter gross domestic product is tracking at a 3.9% annualized growth rate, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve. Moreover, hiring in September was stronger than expected, with nonfarm payrolls up by 119,000, even with signs that major employers are cutting. Amazon, for instance, announced in late October that it was slashing up to 30,000 jobs, joining other large employers announcing cutbacks. A report Tuesday from the 38-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicated that tariffs have yet to bite the global economy but warned that the full impact could be still to come. \"The impacts of higher tariff rates are yet to be fully felt in the U.S. economy,\" the report from the Paris-based OECD said. The report noted a \"sharp decrease in the value of U.S. imported goods subject to tariffs\" which \"suggests that tariffs are affecting demand, and will continue to weigh on trade volumes as announced tariffs come into full effect.\" Those kinds of risks set up challenges for the labor market in the year ahead. An economic report from the Federal Reserve last week also noted that employment \"declined slightly\" over the past seven weeks or so, while manufacturers reported that \"tariffs and tariff uncertainty remained a headwind.\" Commentary out of the Cleveland Fed reflected both sides of the tariff coin: \"One large retailer's average costs had increased around 20 percent year-over-year because of tariffs, and it was trying to determine how it would distribute these increases. By contrast, another large retailer did not anticipate further cost increases, stating that tariff impacts had stabilized.\" Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "Euro zone inflation up a notch to 2.2% in November, flash data shows",
    "content": "Euro zone inflation stood at 2.2% in November, marking a slight rise from the previous month, flash data from data agency Eurostat showed Tuesday. The latest consumer price index reading is just a shade above the European Central Bank's 2% target. Economists polled by Reuters expected a reading of 2.1% for the twelve months to November. Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, services is expected to have the highest annual rate in November, at 3.5% compared with 3.4% in October, Eurostat said. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, was at 2.4% in November, unchanged from the previous month. The ECB held its key deposit facility rate at 2% for the third consecutive time in late October, having last cut rates in June. The trim, which coincided with euro zone inflation hitting the ECB's target rate of 2%, was part of a rate-cutting cycle that has brought rates down from last year's record high of 4%. Top ECB board members have told CNBC in recent months that the easing cycle is close to, or at its end although the central bank has repeatedly said it will take a meeting-by-meeting and data dependent approach to rate setting. After the October trim, ECB President Christine Lagarde told CNBC that from a monetary policy point of view, the economy is in a good place. \"Is it a fixed, good place? No. But we will do whatever is needed to make sure we stay in a good place,\" she said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "An industry focused on death faces an existential crisis",
    "content": "For nearly a century, John Dioguardi's family has been making custom headstones and other memorial markers at Rome Monument in western Pennsylvania. Recently, he's wondered how much time his business has left. Dioguardi has been trying to adapt for more than a decade as the rise in cremations has hurt demand for the traditional burial markers his business has become synonymous with. This year, they've been dealt another blow: President Donald Trump's broad and steep tariffs, which have driven up costs for granite coming to American graveyards from around the world. \"I hope this all works out,\" Dioguardi said. \"I have no idea if it will.\" Rome Monument is part of a fabric of small, family run companies that make memorialization products facing the dual challenges of levies and cremations. Members of the blue-collar industry are in a fight to survive the social, political and economic shifts throwing their livelihoods into a state of disruption. As Dioguardi watched the White House's trade relationship with China fluctuate in recent months, he shifted two-thirds of his supply chain out of the Asian country. Most of it went to India, which has seen a relatively lower tariff rate for much of the year. Dioguardi said bringing production to the U.S. would likely still be more expensive — even with new tariffs — due to higher labor costs. There's another simple reason to look internationally: Some types of granite, like the multi-colored aurora found in India, come only from certain regions abroad. \"God gave the different parts of the world certain yummies,\" Dioguardi said. \"We have nothing like that in our country.\" Trump's levies have altered the bottom lines in the industry, leaving businesses struggling with how to mitigate the additional costs. In September 2024, Milano Monuments' Jim Milano paid around 29% custom duties and taxes on a container coming in from China to his Cleveland-based business. A year later, that rate nearly doubled to 59%. He's talked with fellow memorial monument suppliers about adding an addendum to large orders telling buyers that the price could be later adjusted depending on if tariff rates move. For now, Milano said he and many peers are covering the tariffs out of pocket. He's taken a pay cut as a result. \"There's just so many crazy things that have come up in the last several years,\" said Milano, whose business has been around for half of a century. \"But this tariff thing has been like a gut punch.\" In recent months, Milano has found himself rushing to communicate with his ordering controller when he sees a headline about higher levies to ensure his containers hit the water before they would take effect. Because the monument industry produces specialty products, it typically runs on lead times of several weeks or months. Importers can see significantly different levy rates if the White House adjusts its trade policy between when memorial products are first ordered by customers and the granite is actually shipped to the U.S. \"The uncertainty part is the hardest part we struggle with,\" said Nathan Lange, president of Monument Builders of North America, a trade group representing hundreds of business with an average lifespan of more than seven decades. Granite wholesalers have similarly needed to recalibrate their sales practices. At Kentucky-based PS Granite, operations chief Parthi Damo said they have delayed printing annual marketing materials for next year because they aren't sure if tariff rates could change again, which would mean prices need to be adjusted. Damo said he may switch to making new documents every 60 days in case they need to keep updating prices. Trump has argued that foreign countries or, in some cases, the companies importing their products should eat the tariffs. Data shows that businesses have largely absorbed cost increases in the short term. But memorial creators said that their smaller margins and lower volumes make it tougher to cover the costs than it would be for large retailers. Because the businesses work with shoppers feeling emotions around death, industry members say they need to be especially sensitive when deciding whether to pass down costs to consumers. \"It's hard,\" Milano said. \"We can't go back to a grieving family and say, 'You know what, we got to add an additional $1,000 to your family's memorial to cover the tariffs.'\" Even before the tariffs ramped up, the industry was busy reorienting itself for a future with fewer traditional burials. The U.S.' five-year cremation rate has surged to more than 60% in 2024, up from under 40% a decade and a half prior, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The organization expects more than two out of every three bodies will be cremated in an average year between 2025 and 2029. Dioguardi has considered expanding the work radius around his Pennsylvania headquarters to buoy demand for grave site products, a broader trend which he said has prompted a wave of acquisitions within the industry. Dioguardi and his peers have emphasized alternatives like pedestal memorials for people remembering a cremated loved one. He's also worked on less conventional monuments: Dioguardi recently helped a cemetery install a \"rainbow bridge\" memorial that contains the ashes of pets. \"Cremation has changed our business tremendously,\" Dioguardi said. \"It's created new opportunities. It has closed some other doors.\" If monument builders need to raise prices to account for tariffs, Milano worries it could push more consumers to opt for cremations. Beyond granite, he said levies on production materials have also taken a bite out of profits. To be sure, Canada's monument industry is feeling the heat more intensely with a five-year cremation average expected to surpass 80%. Dioguardi said granite manufacturers he worked with based in America's northern neighbor haven't increased prices due to tariffs given the shrinking domestic demand. Dioguardi said his family operation should be on solid ground for another decade, but he questions if it can exist in its current state beyond that. At the same time, the 75-year-old knows that the fate of the business is married in part to whether people want their loved ones to have any sort of memorialization. When comparing the pyramids the Egyptians opted for to today's trend of having ashes spread somewhere without a marker, Dioguardi isn't exactly confident. Part of the challenge, he and other industry veterans say, is proving that any sort of memorial product is worth the investment. \"Forget about making the pyramid,\" Dioguardi said. \"I don't even know if they want a pebble.\" The Morning Squawk newsletter by Alex Harring is your rundown of five things to know before the stock market opens.

    "headline": "Consumer confidence hits lowest point since April as job worries grow",
    "content": "Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board's Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. \"Consumers were notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,\" said Dana Peterson, the board's chief economist. \"Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings.\" A key reading within the report that measures job expectations showed deterioration. The share of workers saying that jobs are \"plentiful\" slid to 6%, down from 28.6% in October and reflective of the \"no hire, no fire\" current job climate showing in other data points. Another question asking whether jobs were \"hard to get\" edged lower to 17.9%, a drop of 0.4 percentage point. Those results come the same day that payrolls processing firm ADP reported that private companies shed an average 13,500 jobs over the past four weeks. Moreover, the Conference Board survey is consistent with other measures showing weakening sentiment among consumers. For instance, the University of Michigan's sentiment gauge dropped 4.9% in November on a monthly basis and was off 29% from a year ago. The weakening numbers have coincided with public statements from several key Federal Reserve officials who believe further interest rate reductions are warranted. Traders are pricing in a high probability that the Fed lowers its key borrowing rate by another quarter percentage point in December. In the Conference Board survey, Peterson noted weakness across income and political groups. \"Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,\" Peterson said. \"Mentions of the labor market eased somewhat but still stood out among all other frequent themes not already cited.\" Inflation expectations rose, with respondents predicting a 4.8% rate one year from now, well above the Fed's 2% target and topping the Michigan survey outlook for 4.5%. Respondents also expressed \"strongly positive\" expectations for the stock market over the next year. Economic data has been hampered by the recently ended shutdown. Government agencies responsible for the reports suspended all data collection and releases while the impasse continued, with a trickle of mostly dated reports coming out in recent days.

    "headline": "Core wholesale prices rose less than expected in September; retail sales gain",
    "content": "Core wholesale prices rose less than expected in September, indicating a potential cooling in pipeline inflation pressures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. The producer price index, a measure of what producers get for final demand goods and services, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% on the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate. However, excluding food and energy, the index rose just 0.1%, below the 0.2% estimate. Both core and headline PPI had decreased 0.1% in August. Headline PPI was up 2.7% from a year ago, while core rose 2.6%. In an era of tariff-driven cost pressures for imports, goods prices drove the PPI increase, rising 0.9% on the month, while services prices were flat. The jump in goods prices was the biggest since February 2024, according to BLS data. Final demand energy prices jumped 3.5% for the month, while food rose 1.1%. Of the energy increase, much of that was tied to an 11.8% surge in gasoline. On the services side, transportation and warehousing prices rose 0.8%, while airline passenger fees surged 4%. The September PPI release, like most other major official data points, was delayed due to the government shutdown. The BLS may not release October PPI data, as it already has canceled the October consumer price index report. November's CPI is due out Dec. 18. The PPI release is usually timed around the CPI. In other economic news Tuesday, the Census Bureau said retail sales increased 0.2% in September, a bit softer than the 0.3% forecast. However, sales excluding autos rose 0.3%, in line with the estimate. Miscellaneous retailers saw a 2.9% increase on the month, while gas stations, owing to the higher prices, increased 2%. Sporting goods, hobby and music stores saw a 2.5% decline while online sales were off 0.7%. Sales at eating and drinking establishments, an indicator of discretionary spending, increased a solid 0.7% on the month and were up 6.7% from a year ago. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, increased 4.3% from a year ago, ahead of the 3% CPI rate for the month.

    "headline": "Private payroll losses accelerated in the past four weeks, ADP reports",
    "content": "The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That's an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP's has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. Government agencies such as the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Economic Analysis have released revised schedules, but critical reports such as the monthly nonfarm payrolls count won't come out until December. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve won't have much of the usual data they use to make forecasts when they meet again Dec. 9-10. However, in recent days, several officials have advocated for additional interest rate cuts, causing the market to recalibrate expectations to now expecting a reduction at next month's meeting. \"With the next jobs report now scheduled for December 16 and CPI for December 18, there is little on the calendar to derail a cut on December 10,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a client note Sunday. When the releases do start rolling out, Hatzius said he expects that \"alternative indicators show renewed job losses in October\" even though the BLS last week reported better-than-expected 119,000 growth in payrolls for September.

    "content": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the U.S. was not at risk of entering a recession in 2026 and claimed Americans would soon benefit from the Trump administration's economic policies on trade and taxes. \"I am very, very optimistic on 2026,\" Bessent said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy.\" Parts of the GOP's massive spending package — the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — are still going into effect and have yet to be felt in the economy, Bessent said. The new law makes permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts, along with a senior \"bonus\" to offset Social Security taxes and a bigger state and local tax deduction. The plan also has tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay and auto loans. Health-care costs are also expected to become more affordable, Bessent added. The secretary said the Trump administration would have more news on that subject this week. For now, a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace is expected to push up health-care costs for millions of people. Bessent acknowledged that there are parts of the economy showing signs of struggle, including housing and interest-rate-sensitive sectors. He cited the services economy as contributing to inflation, claiming that lower energy prices will soon help to drive down prices. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, also said on Sunday that economic data from the fourth quarter could show weakness because of the government shutdown. The 43-day congressional stalemate in Washington, D.C., was the longest in U.S. history. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, a recent NBC News poll found. Americans' views of the economy largely depend on their income level, according to JPMorgan's latest Cost of Living Survey. High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average, the bank found. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10. In contrast, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.
