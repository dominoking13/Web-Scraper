    "headline": "Tariffs are expected to start showing up more in consumer prices as holiday shopping season starts",
    "content": "While the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season. President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year. While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower. \"There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher.\" Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins. Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding about half a percentage point to the core PCE measure the Federal Reserve uses when assessing inflation. With tariffs, BofA estimates that the inflation rate would be 2.9% in September, so without them that would mean a measure closer to 2.4%. The numbers are similar to ones Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited Wednesday. The core PCE on an annual basis was 2.9% in August. These percentage point differences matter to the Fed, which tries to keep core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 2%, a level it has been above since March 2021. Two Fed officials — regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Lorie Logan of Dallas — said Friday they did not agree with their colleagues' decision Wednesday to lower the central bank's key interest rate. For consumers, they also matter. Bhave estimates that shoppers are bearing about 50%-70% of total tariff costs, with businesses bearing the rest. In real-world terms, that's meant higher prices for things such as coffee, furniture and, recently, clothing prices, which jumped 0.7% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though they are minor components of the price indexes, they are items consumers buy frequently and can create perceptions about inflation, which can produce a self-reinforcing cycle that drives prices higher. \"Inflation in certain goods can have an outsized impact on consumer confidence, even if those items carry a negligible weight in the CPI basket,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note. Price increases in items such as eggs create \"a constant, tangible feedback loop every week at the grocery store. Such items shape perception more than their statistical significance would suggest.\" The firm noted that this holiday season could see more of that sort of thing as artificial Christmas trees are almost all imported from China, which faces heavy costs under the Trump tariffs. \"While Artificial Christmas trees are not unique, they serve as a clear example of how high-tariff, seasonal goods can shape consumer perceptions of inflation,\" Cowen said. Had the duties been in place during the 2024 holiday season, shoppers would have spent an additional $40.6 billion, according to LendingTree estimates using data from multiple government and private sources. LendingTree's Budget Lab further estimates that some 70.5% of new tariffs were passed onto consumers in June 2025. \"That means that even more Americans would have had to fall back on credit cards and personal loans to help cover gift-buying expenses,\" said Matt Schultz, the firm's chief consumer finance analyst. \"That's the unfortunate reality that many people would have faced.\" Using the same estimates, LendingTree said the tariff cost comes to $132 per shopper.

    "headline": "European Central Bank holds rates steady as economy shows resilience",
    "content": "The European Central Bank has kept interest rates on hold, as expected, at its latest meeting on Thursday. The central bank held its key deposit facility rate at 2% for the third consecutive time, having last cut rates in June. The trim, which coincided with euro zone inflation hitting the ECB's target rate of 2%, was part of a rate-cutting cycle that has brought rates down from last year's record high of 4%. The ECB said in a statement Thursday that \"inflation remains close to the 2% medium-term target and the Governing Council's assessment of the inflation outlook is broadly unchanged.\" \"The economy has continued to grow despite the challenging global environment. The robust labour market, solid private sector balance sheets and the Governing Council's past interest rate cuts remain important sources of resilience,\" it said. It cautioned, however, that \"the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.\" While the euro zone inflation rate inched up to 2.2% in September, up from 2% the previous month, the rise was attributed to an increase in services prices and economists had said the central bank was likely to remain cautious about meddling with rates right now. Expectations that the ECB would keep rates on hold were reinforced earlier Thursday when preliminary euro zone growth data showed the economy had grown 0.2% in the third quarter, from the previous three month period. The figure was above expectations and showed that economic activity remained resilient, despite prevailing uncertainty over business activity following U.S. trade tariffs. ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters that while the services sector continued to grow — boosted by strong tourism and a pick-up in digital services — manufacturing had been \"held back by higher tariffs, still heightened uncertainty and a stronger euro.\" She added that the divergence between external and internal demand is \"likely to persist\" in the near term. \"The economy should benefit from consumers spending more as real incomes rise,\" Lagarde noted. \"From a monetary policy point of view, we are in a good place,\" Lagarde told CNBC's Annette Weisbach. \"Is it a fixed, good place? No. But we will do whatever is needed to make sure we stay in a good place.\" After the ECB's announcement, the euro reversed earlier gains to trade 0.26% below the dollar, at $1.1571. \"What a boring announcement,\" Mike Coop, chief investment officer of EMEA at Morningstar Wealth, told CNBC Thursday. \"It does belie the fact that inflation actually has gone back to being pretty much well behaved ... so it's hardly surprising that they're not feeling in a rush to change rates,\" he told CNBC's \"Decision Time.\" \"The bigger picture, I think, is that Europe is still adapting to the triple shocks of the removal of cheap energy, worse trade terms with the U.S. and the need to spend more on defense. On top of those three things, you also have now the U.S. sucking investment out of other parts of the world, so Europe hasn't had that stimulus, that we've seen in the U.S., to support growth,\" he told CNBC's Karen Tso. The central bank has repeatedly said it will take a meeting-by-meeting and data dependent approach to rate setting, and it repeated this stance on Thursday. However, top ECB board members told CNBC this month that the easing cycle is close to, or at its end. Martin Kocher, European Central Bank Governing Council member and governor at Austrian National Bank, said that as long as nothing \"drastic\" happens, Europe is \"OK.\" \"At the moment, I think we're in a good place. So, there's no reason to change anything, as long as there are no changes that force us to do something, Kocher said, speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington. \"And if you take the larger picture, yes, the easing cycle is close to an end or at its end, but there's no reason to pre-commit at that stage.\" In a separate interview, ECB Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau said he recommended \"agile pragmatism\" when it comes to the path for interest rates, adding: \"We are in a good position ... but a good position is not a fixed position.\" A majority of economists polled in mid-October by Reuters said the ECB would hold its deposit rate this year, while 45 of 79 economists polled (57%) saw no change by the end of 2026. — CNBC's Tasmin Lockwood and Leonie Kidd contributed reporting to this story.

    "headline": "Trump cuts fentanyl tariffs on China to 10% as Beijing delays latest rare earths curbs by a year",
    "content": "President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping emerged from a high-stakes meeting touting agreements on tariffs and export controls that amount to a tangible de-escalation of the contentious trade war between the two superpowers. But many details about what was achieved remain unclear, while other key sticking points in the U.S.-China trade relationship appear not to have come up at all. The overall U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports, meanwhile, will stay at a historically high level. The agreements struck during the meeting in Busan, South Korea, do not amount to a comprehensive trade deal — though Trump claimed after the meeting that one would be ready to sign \"pretty soon.\" He nevertheless hailed the summit with Xi as \"amazing,\" and rated it a 12 out of 10. It was the two leaders' first face-to-face meeting in six years. They spoke for one hour and 40 minutes. The top-line outcomes include an agreement by the U.S. to immediately cut fentanyl-related tariffs on China in half, to 10% from 20%. Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the meeting that he believes Xi is \"going to work very hard to stop the flow\" of the addictive opioid fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. China has repeatedly promised to reduce fentanyl trafficking to the U.S., but has been accused by experts of not following through. Trump did not provide additional details. A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a translated statement that \"both sides reached consensus on issues such as cooperation in fentanyl control,\" without elaborating. Trump said the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods will fall to 47% from 57%. The tariff cut addresses \"a key Chinese grievance,\" said Han Shen Lin, China director at advisory firm The Asia Group, showing that \"Beijing's efforts to curb exports of fentanyl precursors, long unrecognized by Washington, are finally being acknowledged.\" Trump and Beijing also confirmed that China agreed to pause recently announced export controls on its valuable rare earths minerals for one year. Those controls were announced on Oct. 9, prompting a furious reply from Trump, who threatened to hike tariffs on China by 100% starting Saturday. The U.S. is dropping that tariff threat, Trump confirmed on Air Force One. He added that he believes that the one-year postponement of the Chinese export controls will be \"routinely extended.\" But the Chinese Commerce Ministry's statement says only that Beijing will suspend the measures for a year, and then \"study and refine specific plans.\" China also made no mention of other export control measures it had imposed earlier in the year, which remain in place. Chinese companies control the majority of the global supply chain for rare earths, which are critical for producing a range of products from semiconductors to missiles. Beijing has ramped up restrictions on exports of critical minerals over the last two years, with a particular focus on limiting their use for military purposes by other countries. \"China's leverage in rare earths and critical minerals processing will continue to surface episodically, effectively capping any escalation in bilateral tensions,\" Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said in a note Thursday. Trump also said \"tremendous amounts\" of U.S. soybeans and other farm products will be purchased by China \"starting immediately.\" China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans. Earlier this year it halted all purchases of the staple crop for months amid the tit-for-tat tariff war, costing American farmers billions of dollars in lost revenue. Ahead of the Trump-Xi summit, China-owned COFCO bought three U.S. soybean cargoes for December and January shipment, equating to about 180,000 metric tons of product — though experts note that is a fraction of prior years' purchases during the autumn harvest. By comparison, in October 2024 China bought nearly 6 million tons of U.S. soybeans, according to USDA data. For all of 2024, China purchased nearly 27 million tons. Soybeans are not specifically mentioned in the Chinese Commerce Ministry's statement, though it says both sides reached consensus on \"expanding agricultural trade.\" U.S. tariff investigations on China's maritime and shipbuilding industries, and Beijing's countermeasures, will also be delayed for one year, the Chinese government said after the meeting. Trump said he will be going to China in April, followed by Xi's trip to the U.S., without specifying a timeline for his Chinese counterpart. Multiple key issues went unaddressed in the meeting, Trump said. On the sale of Nvidia's chips to China, Trump said the two sides had discussed \"a lot of chips,\" but not the most advanced Blackwell chips. \"They are going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips,\" he said. Taiwan was not part of the discussion, Trump said. The two leaders also avoided the subject of Chinese purchasing of Russian oil, a financial lifeline to the Kremlin as it continues to wage war in Ukraine. \"Ukraine came up very strongly,\" Trump said, but \"we didn't really discuss the oil.\"' Trump also gave no hint that he and Xi had struck a deal to keep the popular social media app TikTok from going dark in the U.S. China's government said it would \"work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok.\" Global stocks were lower and gold prices rose 1.2% as investors assessed the ramifications of the trade truce, which comes after several months of economic confrontation. While the trade truce is \"welcome news,\" any indication of addressing underlying structural matters of concern is missing — such as China's industrial excess capacity and nonmarket economy practices — said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute. That means that the truce is \"fragile and tensions are certain to heat up again,\" Cutler added. Before the meeting, the two leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Trump calling Xi \"an old friend\" with whom he has a \"very good relationship,\" and Xi stressing that China's economic growth ambitions would not undermine Trump's vision to \"Make America Great Again.\" Tensions between the world's two economic superpowers have been on a boil this year. The latest escalation came this month, with Beijing export controls and Washington threatening to ban software-powered exports to China. The U.S. had in recent days shared details about deals it hoped to achieve with China – from restricting the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. to TikTok's divestiture from its Beijing-based parent ByteDance. Tariffs, tech curbs and rare earths were also on the table for discussion. Heading into the meeting, Xi shook hands with Trump at the photo-op at Gimhae Air Base in Busan, urging that Washington and Beijing be \"friends and partners\" in his opening remarks. Sitting across the table from Trump, the Chinese leader said that it was a \"great pleasure\" to meet the U.S. president for the sixth time, adding that it was only \"normal\" for the two economic superpowers to have \"frictions now and then.\" \"China's development goes hand in hand with your vision to Make America Great Again,\" Xi said, according to a readout by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. That conciliatory tone marked a notable shift from Xi's meeting with the former U.S. President Joe Biden late last year, during which the speech highlighted more \"inevitable competition\" between the two countries, said Yue Su, principal economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit. While the agreement still lacks a \"strong structural foundation\" and could easily be reversed, both sides are likely to stick with it in the near term to signal goodwill, Su added. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.

    "headline": "‘Partners and friends’: Xi strikes conciliatory tone as he meets Trump in South Korea",
    "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping said Thursday that Beijing and Washington should be \"partners and friends,\" at his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on addressing trade and tariff concerns. The meeting concluded in about one hour and 40 minutes, according to Chinese state media, with the two leaders shaking hands before leaving the venue without making public comments. This is the first time the two leaders met in person since Trump began his second term in January. \"We are gonna have a very successful meeting,\" Trump said at the photo-op with Xi before walking into the meeting. While calling Xi \"a very tough negotiator,\" Trump played up his ties with the Chinese leader, saying that \"we've always had a very good relationship.\" When asked whether the two leaders would finalize a trade deal at the meeting, Trump said \"could be. We'll have a great understanding.\" In his opening remarks, Xi said it was \"normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" while urging both sides to work together and \"ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship\" of bilateral relations, according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry. Xi also lauded Trump's efforts aimed at solving regional conflicts while stressing China's role in promoting peace talks on various issues. The Trump administration earlier this month had hinted that China played a limited role in Thailand and Cambodia ceasefire talks. \"Although the meeting itself is not about peace, [Xi] is mostly trying to create an atmosphere conducive to a deal,\" said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. The high-stakes meeting comes as tensions between the world's two largest economies have been on the boil this year. The latest escalation came this month, with Beijing export controls and Washington threatening to ban software-powered exports to China. The U.S. in recent days has shared details about deals they hope to achieve with China – from restricting the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. to TikTok's divestiture from its Beijing-based parent ByteDance. Tariffs, tech curbs and rare earths are also on the table for discussion. Beijing had been more circumspect about the prospects of an agreement, but in a possible sign of thawing relationship, China bought its first cargoes of U.S. soybeans in several months, Reuters reported Wednesday. The Trump-Xi meeting may be more of a \"tactical pause than a strategic breakthrough\" with both sides contesting with disagreements core to the U.S.-China rivalry, including technology controls, supply chain and security frictions, said Han Shen Lin, China director at advisory firm The Asia Group. \"A temporary truce is better than an uncontrolled trade war,\" Lin added. Xi is in South Korea – his first state visit in 11 years – from Thursday to Saturday to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Gyeongju. Shortly before the meeting started, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he had instructed the Pentagon to restart nuclear weapons testing, claiming that the U.S. has the world's largest nuclear arsenal, followed by Russia and China. The remarks were \"bold and disruptive,\" Lin said, adding that Trump was \"forcing the room to focus on U.S. leverage\" ahead of the meeting. \"If it lands a trade win, it's genius; if it poisons the well, we're in for frostier summits ahead.\" Investors are cautiously watching for headlines from Busan as the trade war between the U.S. and China has kept investors on edge. Global markets soared at the start of the week on growing optimism that the U.S. and China could near an agreement on trade. \"A return to dialogue and engagement — no matter the near-term results — is critical to moving the U.S.-China relationship forward in the long term,\" said Curtis Chin, chair of senior fellows at the Milken Institute, also a former U.S. ambassador to the Asian Development Bank. That said, \"headline-making deals and meetings will need to be followed by well-executed implementation and fulfillment of commitments by both sides,\" said Chin. Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "From futuristic NEOM to tech and tourism, Saudi Arabia's priorities are shifting",
    "content": "When Saudi Arabia first announced plans to reinvent its oil-based economy, huge infrastructure projects like the futuristic region NEOM and smart city The Line were championed as central to the transformation. Almost a decade on from the launch of its \"Vision 2030\" transformation strategy, however, and Riyadh's priorities have shifted with the times. Now, technology and artificial intelligence are key priorities for the kingdom. \"We're reprioritizing a little bit towards sectors that need it the most, and today it's technology, artificial intelligence,\" Faisal Alibrahim, Saudi's economy minister, told CNBC Wednesday. \"We want to move into an economic structure that is productivity-led and at the heart of productivity is technology, innovation and generative AI,\" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh. Riyadh's Vision 2030 strategy to diversify its economy away from oil has seen it invest heavily in tourism, cultural and sports events, technology and infrastructure. \"Our primary objective is non-oil growth and non-oil growth has been steadily increasing, this is our main driver of economic growth,\" Alibrahim said, noting that non-oil activities now represent 56% of total real GDP in Saudi Arabia. \"All of our transformation efforts are to achieve non-oil growth so we can diversify our economy from having to rely on a single commodity price and how big the government budget is, but also to rely on private sector dynamism and to be ready for the future.\" Alibrahim said sectors like tourism had been performing far better than expected, with targets set for 2030 achieved years in advance, prompting the kingdom to up its target to 150 million visitors by the end of the decade, he said. A key pillar of the Vision 2030 program is the creation of NEOM, an urban development project with a futuristic, car-free and zero-carbon city called The Line at its center. It's estimated that the entire NEOM project will cost $1.5 trillion, with The Line seen costing around $500 billion, but Saudi Arabia has looked to cut costs in recent years as its budget deficit has grown amid lower oil prices. Alibrahim said \"agility\" and the ability to shift priorities and amend plans had become key parts of Vision 2030, noting that \"the minute these plans aren't solving for your optimal outcomes is the minute you need to re-plan and adjust.\" This shift in priorities has seen the technology, innovation and artificial intelligence sectors become more important areas of focus. Abdulelah Albarrak, partner for government and public institutions at Oliver Wyman, agreed that Saudi's economic plans had to respond technological change. \"Plans have to remain agile and responsive to changes in evolving technologies, in emerging technologies that really dictate change. It goes without saying these giga and mega projects have a significant economic and socio-economic impact in growing the nation, in driving and cultivating new sectors, but also the emergence of AI and other emerging trends require a lot of focus,\" he said. Alibrahim told CNBC that Saudi was now seen as a land of opportunity for investors, as well as investment. \"People here stopped coming to Saudi to take money, they're coming here to make money,\" he said. \"Saudi stopped being only a source of capital to [being] also a capital of real economic opportunities,\" he added. \"We're just unlocking the potential.\" In September, the Saudi finance ministry estimated in a pre-budget statement that the budget deficit for 2026 will be 3.3% of GDP and that it was comfortable with that level. \"The government will continue to adopt expansionary spending policies that are contrary to the economic cycle, and [which are] directed towards national priorities with social and economic impact, and in a way that contributes to achieving the goals of the Saudi's Vision 2030, and diversifying the economic base,\" the ministry said in a statement. It also forecast that the economy would expand 4.4% in 2025, which it said was supported by the growth of non-oil activities, and by 4.6% in 2026. On Wednesday, Alibrahim upgraded the 2025 forecast, stating that the kingdom's 2025 real GDP growth will be 5.1%. Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister Mohammed Aljadaan has played down concerns over Saudi Arabia's growing debt pile (albeit a relatively low one of 32% of GDP) and deficit. \"The ratio of public debt to GDP is still at relatively low levels compared to many other economies, and that it is within safe limits compared to the size of the economy, and is supported by financial reserves,\" the minister said. — CNBC's Dan Murphy contributed reporting to this story.

    "headline": "Trump’s rare earth deals target China’s dominance — here’s why change won’t come soon",
    "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump's push to secure rare earth supply deals across Asia will ultimately weaken China's dominance in the global supply chain for critical minerals — but analysts said the buildup will take years. Over 10 days, Trump cemented deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and most recently, Japan, to bolster the supply of rare earths and other critical minerals that are crucial for the making of batteries, automobiles, defense systems and computing chips. The flurry of deals — part of Washington's bid to counter Beijing's chokehold on the sector — comes ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan on Thursday. The deals may \"benefit immensely from being linked together in a plurilateral agreement with strong commitments, financing and pooling of resources,\" said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute. She expects more of such deals to follow under the Trump administration. Trump and Xi are expected to address several contentious issues that have stalled the long-running trade talks, including Beijing's rare earth export controls and Washington's tariff threats and technology restrictions. The most recent win for Trump was an agreement with Japan aimed at securing the supply of raw and processed critical minerals while also pledging funding for selected projects within the next six months. Earlier pacts with Australia, Malaysia and Thailand also outlined multibillion-dollar plans, commitments to fair trade practices and to avoid export bans or quotas. While Trump's deals will bring much-needed financial support to the industry and may eventually challenge Beijing's stranglehold over rare earths, experts said the efforts will be costly and take years to bear fruit. \"What we are trying to do now is to get off the Chinese as the primary supply chain, but that will take time,\" said Dennis Wilder, a former senior U.S. intelligence official and now a senior fellow at Georgetown University. \"In the medium term, we will get off the Chinese supply chain, but in the short term, there's still a great deal of dependency on China,\" Wilder stressed. Goldman Sachs estimates new rare earth mines tend to take up to a decade to develop, with known reserves for certain elements \"very scarce\" outside of Myanmar and China, while building refineries would take about 5 years. China dominates 69% of the market share for rare earth mining, 92% of refining and 98% of magnet manufacturing, the bank estimates. These deals are a \"game-changer\" that could reduce the U.S. vulnerabilities to Beijing's export controls, stabilize rare earth prices and accelerate domestic innovative refining and recycling, said Brodie Sutherland, CEO of Patriot Critical Minerals Corp, a U.S.-based critical minerals developer. With assured access to raw materials from friendly nations, American firms can focus on efficient extraction, ethical mining and value-added processing, said Sutherland. He also cited longer-term benefits such as lower risk premiums on financing, faster permitting for new sites and a \"level playing field against subsidized foreign competitors.\" China has allowed rare earth prices to swing in very \"strategic\" ways to make projects in other countries unprofitable, said Mike Rosenberg, a professor of strategic management at IESE Business School. Efforts to diversify and reshore production, however, will inevitably mean accepting some environmental tradeoffs, experts said. Mining and refining rare earth materials in an ecologically friendly way is \"very, very expensive,\" Rosenberg noted, while China kept costs low by limiting environmental controls. \"Consumers may need to accept higher prices for electronics and green technologies that reflect their true material and environmental cost,\" said Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Center at Chatham House. The policy push has also fueled a rally in several U.S.-listed rare earth miners this year. New York-listed shares of MP Materials and Trilogy Metals have each more than quadrupled, Energy Fuels has tripled, while Critical Metals is up nearly 90% and USA Rare Earth about 75%, according to LSEG data. Trump likely rushed to sign these deals to gain leverage ahead of his meeting with Xi in Seoul this week, analysts said. U.S. officials said earlier this week that they expected China to delay imposing export controls on critical minerals for a year as part of a broader trade deal, briefly cooling a rally in mining stocks. \"Beijing's latest threat on sweeping extraterritorial export restrictions in this sector has served as a needed wake-up call to partners around the world,\" said Asia Society Policy Institute's Cutler. China may have miscalculated with the export controls that rattled the global economy and widened the trade war to include other nations, said Wilder of Georgetown University, noting that \"it wasn't in China's interest.\" \"It was a useful weapon when it was targeted at the U.S., but it becomes less useful when you try and expand that to the rest of the world,\" Wilder said. \"Because then you bring the rest of the world over to the U.S. in many ways.\" Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "Trump says he expects to lower fentanyl-related tariffs on Beijing ahead of Xi meeting",
    "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said he expects to lower fentanyl-linked tariffs on China as Beijing confirmed a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and the American leader. A spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Xi will meet Trump in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday to exchange views on issues of shared concerns, without elaborating. \"We are willing to work with the U.S. to push the meeting toward achieving positive outcomes,\" the spokesperson said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One that fentanyl flows into the U.S. and \"farmers\" will be among topics he expects to discuss with Xi on Thursday. When asked whether the potential one-year pause in Beijing's implementation of rare earth export controls would be enough to draw more concessions from the U.S., Trump said \"we haven't talked about the timing yet but we are gonna work out something.\" The two leaders' meeting — their first in-person sit-down since Trump's return to the office in January — comes as bilateral tensions have escalated in recent weeks. Beijing has turned up the heat on rare earth export controls, while Washington has retaliated with port fees on Chinese ships and threatened software-related export restrictions. A delicate trade detente between the world's top two economies that includes lower tariffs on each other's goods is nearing its expiration on Nov. 10, if they fail to agree on another extension. Trump has also threatened additional 100% tariffs on Beijing starting Nov. 1. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that the U.S. could cut the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports by half, in return for Beijing's crack down on the export of chemicals that make fentanyl. If Washington were to lower those tariffs to 10%, that would bring the average duty on most Chinese imports — currently around 55% — to about 45%. On whether Taiwan would be on the agenda, Trump said \"I don't know if we'll even speak about Taiwan. He may want to ask about it. There is not that much to ask about it.\" Answering a question about exports of Nvidia's Blackwell chips to China, Trump said \"I think we may be talking about that with President Xi.\" In a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit on Wednesday, Trump said that he hoped to reach an agreement with Xi, which will be \"a good deal for both.\" The U.S. will also finalize a trade agreement with South Korea \"very soon,\" he added. Chinese President Xi will also deliver a speech at the summit and hold bilateral meetings with foreign leaders, a spokesperson of the ministry said last Friday. The U.S. president kicked off his whirlwind Asia trip on Sunday, signing a flurry of trade and mineral agreements with Southeast Asian leaders and most recently Japan. Likely outcomes from the Trump-Xi meeting include Beijing's guarantee of ensuring the U.S. access to rare earth items under its export-control measures, purchases of Boeing aircraft, approval for the sale of TikTok's U.S. operation and more efforts on curbing fentanyl flows, according to Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI. In return, the U.S. could offer to loosen export controls on certain semiconductor equipment and AI chips, roll back the 100% tariff threat, in addition to a reduction of 10 percentage points in the fentanyl-linked tariffs, starting from Nov. 10 as part of a renewed tariff truce, Wang said. \"We expect Beijing to give Trump a way out on the fentanyl deadlock, such as via a new promise from Xi in person, to facilitate Trump's reduction on China fentanyl tariff, effective no later than Nov. 10,\" Wang added.

    "headline": "Private sector has created nearly 15,000 jobs a week, preliminary ADP data shows",
    "content": "Private sector employers added an average 14,250 jobs per week over the past four weeks, according to new preliminary data being released by ADP, a turnaround from the negative September numbers. Stepping into the void created by the government shutdown, ADP will now release a four-week average weekly change in employment with a two-week lag every Tuesday. Today's number is the four-week average ended Oct. 11. \"ADP's near real-time employment data, released weekly, will now provide an even clearer picture of the labor market at this critical time for the economy ... providing a dynamic view of job creation and loss at an unprecedented level of weekly detail,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. This preliminary data will be different from the better-known and closely followed National Employment Report, generally released on the Wednesday before the government's payroll number. The NER measures the monthly change in job growth during the week that contains the 12th of the month and provides detail of job growth by sector. The preliminary data, which can serve as a guide to the monthly data, offers a four-week moving average of weekly job growth. It will be revised monthly with the release of the NER. The 14,250 increase suggests monthly job growth totaled around 55,000 for the four-week period, compared with a loss of -32,000 reported for September in the NER. However, the total is subject to revision with the release of the NER. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "'Battered and bruised but still standing': WTO chief on trade after tariffs",
    "content": "Global trade is not broken, despite the disruption, pressure and shock of trade tariffs introduced by the U.S. this year, the head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) told CNBC Tuesday. \"Many people have the impression that, because of the unilateral actions of the U.S., that global trade is broken. Yes [they've] been a great disruption — the greatest disruption of global trade in 80 years — but we are pleased to see the resilience of the system,\" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said. \"The system is battered, it's bruised, but it's still standing,\" she told CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia. Okonjo-Iweala's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump, the architect of multiple U.S. tariffs on foreign imports to the States, continues a tour of Asia in which he has signed trade deals and truces, so far. But the big prize for Trump will be whether he and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who are due to meet Thursday, can come to a deal to reduce duties and counter-tariffs on a range of each other's goods. Trump said Monday that Washington and Beijing were poised to \"come away with\" a trade deal, raising market hopes. \"We do wish that the meeting goes very well,\" Okonjo-Iweala said, noting that any de-escalation in trade tensions would be welcome. \"Any threat of disconnect and conflict between China and the U.S. in trade is not good for either country or for the world. Any threat of fragmentation or division between the two, into two global trading camps, will lead to losses in global welfare, and the poorer countries will be harder hit,\" she said. Earlier in October, the WTO hiked its forecast for global trade growth in 2025, but warned the outlook for 2026 had deteriorated. Despite predicting that trade volume growth would stand at 2.4% this year, up sharply from a previous estimate of 0.9% in the trade body's August report, the WTO slashed its previous expectation of 1.8% trade volume growth next year to a lackluster 0.5%. It cited a cooling global economy and the impact of higher tariffs as a reason for the revision. Trade tariffs have become a dominant feature, and headwind, for global commerce since U.S. President Donald Trump shocked friends and foes alike with his widescale tariffs regime in April. Countries scrambled to reach trade deals with the White House but even allies, such as the U.K., have seen a baseline 10% tariff remain on goods exported to the U.S. Global trade volumes rose sharply in the first half of 2025 — up 4.9% year on year — with several factors contributing to the robust expansion. These included the front-loading of imports into the U.S. in anticipation of higher trade tariffs, and favorable macroeconomic conditions with disinflation, supportive fiscal policies and tight labor markets boosting real incomes and spending in major economies, the WTO said. Strong growth in emerging markets and increased demand for artificial intelligence-related goods — including semiconductors, servers and telecommunications equipment — also fueled global trade growth, it added, with AI-related spending driving nearly half of the overall trade expansion in the first half of the year, rising 20% year on year in value terms. Global competition when it comes to developing AI-related products has heated up. The WTO noted that the U.S. accounted for roughly one-fifth of global AI-related trade growth in the first half of 2025. The bulk of the expansion came from Asia, however, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of global AI-related trade growth in the same time period. Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "Here are the five key takeaways from Friday's consumer price index report",
    "content": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released its much-anticipated consumer price index report, delayed a week and a half because of the government shutdown. Here are the five most important takeaways: \"In aggregate today's inflation readings are encouraging, albeit still above the Federal Reserve's stated 2% inflation target. Yet, we think the overall inflation trend can continue to moderate over the next year ... as inflation breakevens have recently suggested, allowing the Fed to maintain its bias toward rate cuts.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a finalist to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair next year \"Look beneath the headline and what one sees on a year ago basis are large increases in the cost of food, meat, housing, and utilities. Middle class & down-market households experiencing a slowing pace of wage growth are clearly having difficulty adjusting to persisting increases in the cost of living ... It's only natural that those that inhibit the lower spur of the K ask: what is it that those celebrating a more modest increase in the pace of price increases see that indicates inflation is not eroding my bottom line & standard of living?\" — Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSK, on the K-shaped economy \"Signs of spillovers from tariffs remain weak and support the view that tariff hikes will translate into a one-off bump in prices instead of persistent inflationary pressures.\" — Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISM Got a confidential news tip?
