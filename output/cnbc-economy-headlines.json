    "headline": "Delayed tariff impact starting to hit, could cause companies to reduce head count in 2026",
    "content": "President Donald Trump's tariffs, aimed at reshoring American jobs lost to overseas manufacturing, could end up lowering domestic head count instead, according to recent statements from corporate executives and economic forecasters. With the labor market already on its heels in a no-fire, no-hire climate, concerns are rising that the duties on U.S. imports will raise operating costs and force companies to start paring their employment rolls. For instance, respondents to the Institute for Supply Management's November survey of factory conditions expressed elevated levels of worry. \"We are starting to institute more permanent changes due to the tariff environment,\" one transportation equipment executive wrote. \"This includes reduction of staff, new guidance to shareholders, and development of additional offshore manufacturing that would have otherwise been for U.S. export.\" The ISM surveys do not identify respondents by name but rather by industry. Similar comments were found elsewhere in report, which showed that the ISM manufacturing index edged further into territory signaling a decline in business conditions. The headline reading of 48.2% represents the share of businesses reporting expansion, so anything below 50% is indicative of contraction. The survey's employment gauge fell 2 points to 44%, its lowest reading since August and consistent with the gradual but persistent trend of labor market softening. There were other signs that the labor picture is darkening heading into 2026. Trump has pushed hard for energy exploration and increased utilization of fossil fuels. But an ISM respondent from the petroleum and coal industry reported, \"No major changes at this time, but going into 2026, we expect to see big changes with cash flow and employee head count. The company has sold off a big part of the business that generated free cash while offering voluntary severance packages to anyone.\" One manager in the electrical equipment, appliances and components business said tariffs are causing a tougher business climate than during the Covid crisis. \"Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty,\" the respondent said. To be sure, broader economic conditions remain fairly stable. Third-quarter gross domestic product is tracking at a 3.9% annualized growth rate, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve. Moreover, hiring in September was stronger than expected, with nonfarm payrolls up by 119,000, even with signs that major employers are cutting. Amazon, for instance, announced in late October that it was slashing up to 30,000 jobs, joining other large employers announcing cutbacks. A report Tuesday from the 38-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicated that tariffs have yet to bite the global economy but warned that the full impact could be still to come. \"The impacts of higher tariff rates are yet to be fully felt in the U.S. economy,\" the report from the Paris-based OECD said. The report noted a \"sharp decrease in the value of U.S. imported goods subject to tariffs\" which \"suggests that tariffs are affecting demand, and will continue to weigh on trade volumes as announced tariffs come into full effect.\" Those kinds of risks set up challenges for the labor market in the year ahead. An economic report from the Federal Reserve last week also noted that employment \"declined slightly\" over the past seven weeks or so, while manufacturers reported that \"tariffs and tariff uncertainty remained a headwind.\" Commentary out of the Cleveland Fed reflected both sides of the tariff coin: \"One large retailer's average costs had increased around 20 percent year-over-year because of tariffs, and it was trying to determine how it would distribute these increases. By contrast, another large retailer did not anticipate further cost increases, stating that tariff impacts had stabilized.\" Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "Euro zone inflation up a notch to 2.2% in November, flash data shows",
    "content": "Euro zone inflation stood at 2.2% in November, marking a slight rise from the previous month, flash data from data agency Eurostat showed Tuesday. The latest consumer price index reading is just a shade above the European Central Bank's 2% target. Economists polled by Reuters expected a reading of 2.1% for the twelve months to November. Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, services is expected to have the highest annual rate in November, at 3.5% compared with 3.4% in October, Eurostat said. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, was at 2.4% in November, unchanged from the previous month. The ECB held its key deposit facility rate at 2% for the third consecutive time in late October, having last cut rates in June. The trim, which coincided with euro zone inflation hitting the ECB's target rate of 2%, was part of a rate-cutting cycle that has brought rates down from last year's record high of 4%. Top ECB board members have told CNBC in recent months that the easing cycle is close to, or at its end although the central bank has repeatedly said it will take a meeting-by-meeting and data dependent approach to rate setting. After the October trim, ECB President Christine Lagarde told CNBC that from a monetary policy point of view, the economy is in a good place. \"Is it a fixed, good place? No. But we will do whatever is needed to make sure we stay in a good place,\" she said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "An industry focused on death faces an existential crisis",
    "content": "For nearly a century, John Dioguardi's family has been making custom headstones and other memorial markers at Rome Monument in western Pennsylvania. Recently, he's wondered how much time his business has left. Dioguardi has been trying to adapt for more than a decade as the rise in cremations has hurt demand for the traditional burial markers his business has become synonymous with. This year, they've been dealt another blow: President Donald Trump's broad and steep tariffs, which have driven up costs for granite coming to American graveyards from around the world. \"I hope this all works out,\" Dioguardi said. \"I have no idea if it will.\" Rome Monument is part of a fabric of small, family run companies that make memorialization products facing the dual challenges of levies and cremations. Members of the blue-collar industry are in a fight to survive the social, political and economic shifts throwing their livelihoods into a state of disruption. As Dioguardi watched the White House's trade relationship with China fluctuate in recent months, he shifted two-thirds of his supply chain out of the Asian country. Most of it went to India, which has seen a relatively lower tariff rate for much of the year. Dioguardi said bringing production to the U.S. would likely still be more expensive — even with new tariffs — due to higher labor costs. There's another simple reason to look internationally: Some types of granite, like the multi-colored aurora found in India, come only from certain regions abroad. \"God gave the different parts of the world certain yummies,\" Dioguardi said. \"We have nothing like that in our country.\" Trump's levies have altered the bottom lines in the industry, leaving businesses struggling with how to mitigate the additional costs. In September 2024, Milano Monuments' Jim Milano paid around 29% custom duties and taxes on a container coming in from China to his Cleveland-based business. A year later, that rate nearly doubled to 59%. He's talked with fellow memorial monument suppliers about adding an addendum to large orders telling buyers that the price could be later adjusted depending on if tariff rates move. For now, Milano said he and many peers are covering the tariffs out of pocket. He's taken a pay cut as a result. \"There's just so many crazy things that have come up in the last several years,\" said Milano, whose business has been around for half of a century. \"But this tariff thing has been like a gut punch.\" In recent months, Milano has found himself rushing to communicate with his ordering controller when he sees a headline about higher levies to ensure his containers hit the water before they would take effect. Because the monument industry produces specialty products, it typically runs on lead times of several weeks or months. Importers can see significantly different levy rates if the White House adjusts its trade policy between when memorial products are first ordered by customers and the granite is actually shipped to the U.S. \"The uncertainty part is the hardest part we struggle with,\" said Nathan Lange, president of Monument Builders of North America, a trade group representing hundreds of business with an average lifespan of more than seven decades. Granite wholesalers have similarly needed to recalibrate their sales practices. At Kentucky-based PS Granite, operations chief Parthi Damo said they have delayed printing annual marketing materials for next year because they aren't sure if tariff rates could change again, which would mean prices need to be adjusted. Damo said he may switch to making new documents every 60 days in case they need to keep updating prices. Trump has argued that foreign countries or, in some cases, the companies importing their products should eat the tariffs. Data shows that businesses have largely absorbed cost increases in the short term. But memorial creators said that their smaller margins and lower volumes make it tougher to cover the costs than it would be for large retailers. Because the businesses work with shoppers feeling emotions around death, industry members say they need to be especially sensitive when deciding whether to pass down costs to consumers. \"It's hard,\" Milano said. \"We can't go back to a grieving family and say, 'You know what, we got to add an additional $1,000 to your family's memorial to cover the tariffs.'\" Even before the tariffs ramped up, the industry was busy reorienting itself for a future with fewer traditional burials. The U.S.' five-year cremation rate has surged to more than 60% in 2024, up from under 40% a decade and a half prior, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The organization expects more than two out of every three bodies will be cremated in an average year between 2025 and 2029. Dioguardi has considered expanding the work radius around his Pennsylvania headquarters to buoy demand for grave site products, a broader trend which he said has prompted a wave of acquisitions within the industry. Dioguardi and his peers have emphasized alternatives like pedestal memorials for people remembering a cremated loved one. He's also worked on less conventional monuments: Dioguardi recently helped a cemetery install a \"rainbow bridge\" memorial that contains the ashes of pets. \"Cremation has changed our business tremendously,\" Dioguardi said. \"It's created new opportunities. It has closed some other doors.\" If monument builders need to raise prices to account for tariffs, Milano worries it could push more consumers to opt for cremations. Beyond granite, he said levies on production materials have also taken a bite out of profits. To be sure, Canada's monument industry is feeling the heat more intensely with a five-year cremation average expected to surpass 80%. Dioguardi said granite manufacturers he worked with based in America's northern neighbor haven't increased prices due to tariffs given the shrinking domestic demand. Dioguardi said his family operation should be on solid ground for another decade, but he questions if it can exist in its current state beyond that. At the same time, the 75-year-old knows that the fate of the business is married in part to whether people want their loved ones to have any sort of memorialization. When comparing the pyramids the Egyptians opted for to today's trend of having ashes spread somewhere without a marker, Dioguardi isn't exactly confident. Part of the challenge, he and other industry veterans say, is proving that any sort of memorial product is worth the investment. \"Forget about making the pyramid,\" Dioguardi said. \"I don't even know if they want a pebble.\" The Morning Squawk newsletter by Alex Harring is your rundown of five things to know before the stock market opens.

    "headline": "Consumer confidence hits lowest point since April as job worries grow",
    "content": "Consumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday. The board's Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2. In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points. \"Consumers were notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,\" said Dana Peterson, the board's chief economist. \"Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings.\" A key reading within the report that measures job expectations showed deterioration. The share of workers saying that jobs are \"plentiful\" slid to 6%, down from 28.6% in October and reflective of the \"no hire, no fire\" current job climate showing in other data points. Another question asking whether jobs were \"hard to get\" edged lower to 17.9%, a drop of 0.4 percentage point. Those results come the same day that payrolls processing firm ADP reported that private companies shed an average 13,500 jobs over the past four weeks. Moreover, the Conference Board survey is consistent with other measures showing weakening sentiment among consumers. For instance, the University of Michigan's sentiment gauge dropped 4.9% in November on a monthly basis and was off 29% from a year ago. The weakening numbers have coincided with public statements from several key Federal Reserve officials who believe further interest rate reductions are warranted. Traders are pricing in a high probability that the Fed lowers its key borrowing rate by another quarter percentage point in December. In the Conference Board survey, Peterson noted weakness across income and political groups. \"Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,\" Peterson said. \"Mentions of the labor market eased somewhat but still stood out among all other frequent themes not already cited.\" Inflation expectations rose, with respondents predicting a 4.8% rate one year from now, well above the Fed's 2% target and topping the Michigan survey outlook for 4.5%. Respondents also expressed \"strongly positive\" expectations for the stock market over the next year. Economic data has been hampered by the recently ended shutdown. Government agencies responsible for the reports suspended all data collection and releases while the impasse continued, with a trickle of mostly dated reports coming out in recent days.

    "headline": "Core wholesale prices rose less than expected in September; retail sales gain",
    "content": "Core wholesale prices rose less than expected in September, indicating a potential cooling in pipeline inflation pressures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. The producer price index, a measure of what producers get for final demand goods and services, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% on the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate. However, excluding food and energy, the index rose just 0.1%, below the 0.2% estimate. Both core and headline PPI had decreased 0.1% in August. Headline PPI was up 2.7% from a year ago, while core rose 2.6%. In an era of tariff-driven cost pressures for imports, goods prices drove the PPI increase, rising 0.9% on the month, while services prices were flat. The jump in goods prices was the biggest since February 2024, according to BLS data. Final demand energy prices jumped 3.5% for the month, while food rose 1.1%. Of the energy increase, much of that was tied to an 11.8% surge in gasoline. On the services side, transportation and warehousing prices rose 0.8%, while airline passenger fees surged 4%. The September PPI release, like most other major official data points, was delayed due to the government shutdown. The BLS may not release October PPI data, as it already has canceled the October consumer price index report. November's CPI is due out Dec. 18. The PPI release is usually timed around the CPI. In other economic news Tuesday, the Census Bureau said retail sales increased 0.2% in September, a bit softer than the 0.3% forecast. However, sales excluding autos rose 0.3%, in line with the estimate. Miscellaneous retailers saw a 2.9% increase on the month, while gas stations, owing to the higher prices, increased 2%. Sporting goods, hobby and music stores saw a 2.5% decline while online sales were off 0.7%. Sales at eating and drinking establishments, an indicator of discretionary spending, increased a solid 0.7% on the month and were up 6.7% from a year ago. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, increased 4.3% from a year ago, ahead of the 3% CPI rate for the month.

    "headline": "Private payroll losses accelerated in the past four weeks, ADP reports",
    "content": "The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That's an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative information like ADP's has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. Government agencies such as the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Economic Analysis have released revised schedules, but critical reports such as the monthly nonfarm payrolls count won't come out until December. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve won't have much of the usual data they use to make forecasts when they meet again Dec. 9-10. However, in recent days, several officials have advocated for additional interest rate cuts, causing the market to recalibrate expectations to now expecting a reduction at next month's meeting. \"With the next jobs report now scheduled for December 16 and CPI for December 18, there is little on the calendar to derail a cut on December 10,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a client note Sunday. When the releases do start rolling out, Hatzius said he expects that \"alternative indicators show renewed job losses in October\" even though the BLS last week reported better-than-expected 119,000 growth in payrolls for September. The Goldman team expects the Fed to react with a cut in December and two more quarter percentage point reductions in 2026. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "Bessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challenged",
    "content": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the U.S. was not at risk of entering a recession in 2026 and claimed Americans would soon benefit from the Trump administration's economic policies on trade and taxes. \"I am very, very optimistic on 2026,\" Bessent said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy.\" Parts of the GOP's massive spending package — the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — are still going into effect and have yet to be felt in the economy, Bessent said. The new law makes permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts, along with a senior \"bonus\" to offset Social Security taxes and a bigger state and local tax deduction. The plan also has tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay and auto loans. Health-care costs are also expected to become more affordable, Bessent added. The secretary said the Trump administration would have more news on that subject this week. For now, a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace is expected to push up health-care costs for millions of people. Bessent acknowledged that there are parts of the economy showing signs of struggle, including housing and interest-rate-sensitive sectors. He cited the services economy as contributing to inflation, claiming that lower energy prices will soon help to drive down prices. Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, also said on Sunday that economic data from the fourth quarter could show weakness because of the government shutdown. The 43-day congressional stalemate in Washington, D.C., was the longest in U.S. history. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, a recent NBC News poll found. Americans' views of the economy largely depend on their income level, according to JPMorgan's latest Cost of Living Survey. High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average, the bank found. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10. In contrast, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "Fed won't get key inflation data before next rate decision as BLS cancels October CPI release",
    "content": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it was canceling the release of the October consumer price index, leaving the Federal Reserve without a key piece of inflation data to ponder when it next decides on interest rates on Dec. 10. The CPI data, previously scheduled to be released on Nov. 7, was canceled because the government shutdown made it impossible for the BLS to \"retroactively collect\" certain parts of survey data, the agency said on its website. November's CPI data, previously scheduled to be released on Dec. 10, will now be released on Dec. 18 after the Fed decision, the BLS said. Bureau data collectors compile the index through several methods, including personal visits and phone calls that were not possible during the shutdown. The BLS also uses online data and household surveys that also would make it difficult to retroactively collect information. In addition to the Fed announcement, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said another key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, \"is to be rescheduled\" though no firm date has been announced. The Fed uses the PCE price index as its main inflation forecasting tool. The gauge had been set for release Nov. 26. Fed officials have voiced concerns about being in a data fog as they try to formulate monetary policy. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter percentage point rate cut in late October, but minutes from the meeting reflected worries over getting an incomplete picture. \"This is a temporary state of affairs. And we're going to do our jobs, we're going to collect every scrap of data we can find, evaluate it, and think carefully about it,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the October meeting. \"What do you do if you're driving in the fog? You slow down. ... There's a possibility that it would make sense to be more cautious about moving.\" However, New York Fed President John Williams said Friday he thinks the Fed probably has \"room for a further adjustment in the near term,\" implying the likelihood of a cut sometime soon. Other Fed officials, such as Governor Christopher Waller, have said policymakers still have enough information to make informed decisions, even with the data drought from the shutdown.

    "headline": "Fed's Hammack supports keeping rates around current 'barely restrictive' level",
    "content": "Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Thursday gave indications that she thinks the central bank could be nearing the end of what could be a brief rate-cutting cycle. The policymaker told CNBC that she thinks the current level of interest rates is \"barely restrictive, if at all\" when it comes to the economic impact. Restrictiveness is a key metric for Fed officials, who are divided ideologically over whether labor market weakness or inflation is a bigger threat. Hammack has been more in the hawkish camp when it comes to inflation, preferring higher rates and more restrictive policy as a bulwark against another surge in prices. \"I think that we need to maintain a modestly, somewhat restrictive stance of policy to make sure that we are continuing to bring inflation back down to our 2% objective,\" she told CNBC's Steve Liesman on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"Right now, to me, monetary policy is barely restrictive, if at all, and I think we need to make sure that we're maintaining that somewhat restrictive stance to bring monetary to bring in place.\" Hammack added that she thinks the current federal funds rate, targeted in a range between 3.75%-4%, is \"right around a neutral rate,\" indicating it does not need to come down much further. Hammack will be a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee next year. The Fed next meets Dec. 9-10, and market expectations have swung from a near-certainty that the committee would approve a third consecutive quarter percentage point reduction to now pricing in about a 60% probability that the committee will stand pat, per the CME Group's FedWatch tracker of futures prices. Minutes from the October meeting, released Wednesday, detailed the sharp divide among committee members. While focused on inflation, Hammack expressed concern over current price levels, noting that interviews she and her staff have conducted around the Cleveland area indicate labor market pressures as well as inflation concerns that are causing difficulty for households to make ends meet. \"What we hear from the workers is that they're holding on to their jobs for dear life, if they have them,\" she said. \"We are in this slow, this low-hiring, low-firing environment. But what I also heard ... was that the money that they have coming in is just not stretching as far as it used to. What used to cost $30 now costs $50, and so ... that inflationary pressure is still very salient for them.\" Addressing the September nonfarm payrolls report released Thursday, Hammack called the picture \"mixed\" as it showed both higher-than-expected payrolls growth and a tick up in the unemployment rate. Correction: Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack will be a member of the FOMC next year. An earlier version of this story misstated when she would serve on the rate-setting committee.

    "headline": "Delayed September report shows U.S. added 119,000 jobs, more than expected; unemployment rate at 4.4%",
    "content": "The U.S. economy added substantially more jobs than expected in September, according to a long-awaited report Thursday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 119,000 in the month, up from the 4,000 jobs lost in August following a downward revision. The Dow Jones consensus estimate for September was 50,000. The July total also was revised down to 72,000, a decrease of 7,000 from the prior release. In addition to the headline jobs number, the BLS said the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.4%, the highest it's been since October 2021. A broader measure that includes those not looking for jobs or working part-time for economic reasons edged lower to 8%. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% for the month and 3.8% from a year ago, compared to respective forecasts for 0.3% and 3.7%. The report ends a data drought on the labor market that began in early September and continued through the record 44-day government shutdown. Agencies including the BLS, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and others were prohibited from collecting or releasing data during the period. This was the first BLS jobs report since the count for August that was released Sept. 5. It also was the second since Trump fired then-BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1, following a July jobs report that contained massive revisions for prior months. \"September's jobs report shows the labor market still had resilience before the shutdown, beating payroll expectations, but the picture remains muddy with August jobs revised to a job loss and the unemployment rate increasing,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"These numbers are a snapshot from two months ago and they don't reflect where we stand now in November.\" Stock market futures nevertheless added to gains following the report while Treasury yields were mostly lower. Traders also continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will not lower rates further at its Dec. 9-10 meeting. This is the last jobs report Fed policymakers will get before then. Hawkish talk out of the October Fed meeting, as reflected in minutes released Wednesday, contributed to a general feeling that the central bank will be on hold into the end of the year. \"Despite the fact that today's jobs report is very backward looking, it's making markets move,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"Equities like the fact that payrolls were stronger than expected, suggesting the economy is still on a firm footing, while the bond market likes the rise in unemployment and slowdown in wage growth which may keep the case for a December Fed cut just about alive.\" Overall, the report shows the labor market entered the autumn months on much the same footing it has been all year – a slow but steady pace, with firms reluctant both to hire many new workers or lay off existing workforce during a time of unusual economic volatility spurred by aggressive policy actions in President Donald Trump's White House. A separate Labor Department release Thursday showed that initial jobless claims totaled 220,000 for the week ending Nov. 15, down 8,000 from the prior period and lower than the consensus forecast for 227,000. Job gains in September came from familiar sources, with health care leading at 43,000, about right on target with its pace over the past year. Bars and restaurants contributed 37,000 while social assistance added 14,000. On the downside, transportation and warehousing lost 25,000 and federal government, which had been a large contributor to employment growth, was off 3,000, part of a loss of 97,000 on the calendar year. Professional and business services also reported a decline of 20,000, fueled by a drop of 16,000 in temporary help. The household survey, used to calculate the unemployment rate, painted an even brighter picture of the labor market. The total level of those employed rose by 251,000 while the labor force increased by 470,000 to a fresh record of 171.2 million. The participation rate, which measures the share of the working-age population either working or seeking employment, edged higher to 62.4, the highest since May. The rolls of full-time employment swelled by 673,000 while part-times fell by 573,000. The lack of comprehensive indicators has presented a challenge for Fed officials, who cut their benchmark interest rate in both September and October but face a tougher decision in December. Officials at the October meeting noted the difficulty in navigating policy without the usual array of economic metrics to rely on, and there was a significant inclination to forgo a December cut, according to meeting minutes released Wednesday. With September's payrolls count released, the BLS is preparing the first influx of other data in coming months. The bureau on Wednesday announced it will release jobs data for October and November simultaneously on Dec. 16. October's numbers will not include the customary unemployment rate calculation as that comes from a survey of households that will not be able to be completed because of the shutdown.
