    "headline": "Job openings in October slumped to the lowest level since February 2021, Indeed measure shows",
    "content": "Employment opportunities hit their lowest level in more than 4½ years as October came to a close and the government shutdown dragged on, according to data from jobs site Indeed. The firm's Job Postings Index fell to 101.9 as of Oct. 24, the most recent point for which data is available. That's the lowest since early February 2021 for a measure that uses February 2020 as a baseline value of 100. The level represents a 0.5% decline from the beginning of the month and a roughly 3.5% tumble from mid-August, the latest point from which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available. Under normal conditions, the BLS on Tuesday would have reported its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a measure that Federal Reserve officials watch closely for indications of slack in the jobs market. With the shutdown on the precipice of being the longest in history, economists and policymakers are left to look at alternative data for big-picture indicators. The most recent JOLTS report, for August, also indicated an ongoing decline in openings. The BLS reported that job openings totaled 7.23 million, about level with July but down 7% from January. Indeed's dashboard of indicators also has shown a pullback in salary offerings as job advertisements have declined. Year-over-year wages as judged by salary offerings in Indeed postings rose 2.5% in August, down from 3.4% in January. A softening labor market has generated concern from Fed officials. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee last week voted 10-2 to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%. Officials have cited rising risks to the labor market taking precedence over ongoing concerns about inflation holding nearly a full percentage point above the Fed's 2% target. \"Hiring is slowing. We see this from Indeed, from job postings,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said Monday. \"We're looking at a panoply of data, and those are real time. We're not waiting on the unemployment report. There's reason to be concerned, because there's a slight uptick in the unemployment rate over the summer.\" The nonfarm payrolls report normally would be released Friday, but that also is not happening. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the BLS count would have shown a decline of 60,000 jobs in October and an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.5%. Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "Bessent says U.S. has 'lots' of options to use on tariffs if it loses Supreme Court case",
    "content": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that there are other options in case of defeat as the Supreme Court is about to hear a landmark case on President Donald Trump's tariffs. The high court is set Wednesday to hear arguments on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact sweeping duties on U.S. trading partners. At stake is the leeway presidents have to wield over trade measures as a tool of economic policy. Bessent expressed confidence in a CNBC \"Squawk Box\" interview that the administration will prevail, but has additional outlets it can use in case the decision goes the other way. \"There are lots of other authorities that can be used, but IEEPA is by far the cleanest, and it gives the U.S. and the president the most negotiating authority,\" he said. \"The others are more cumbersome, but they can be effective.\" Specifically, Bessent cited Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which provides a justification on grounds of national security, as well as Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which regulates unfair trading practices. However, they would limit the president's ability to use tariffs, as Trump has, under \"emergency\" grounds. \"This is very important tomorrow, and SCOTUS is going to hear this,\" Bessent said, referring to the court's nickname. \"This is a signature policy for the president, and traditionally, SCOTUS has been loath to interfere with these signature policies.\" Outside of the court case, the secretary talked up the relationship the White House has with China, following last week's meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. An agreement reached at the gathering in South Korea resulted in deals that set back some of the most onerous tariffs the two sides had slapped on each other. \"It was a very good meeting. Both sides approached it with great respect,\" Bessent said. \"I think President Trump is the only leader who President Xi respects. ... The relationship is in a good place.\" Bessent said there are two state visits set up for 2026, one in Beijing and the other in the U.S. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "headline": "AI-washing and the massive layoffs hitting the economy",
    "content": "Corporate America is getting rocked by historic rounds of white-collar layoffs, leading some to wonder: Has AI finally come for their jobs? While the proliferation of generative and agentic artificial intelligence is playing a role, recent job cut announcements from companies like Amazon, UPS and Target are about a lot more than just the advance of new technology. The firms, which each announced layoffs in recent weeks totaling more than 60,000 roles eliminated this year, said they're trying to cut corporate bloat, streamline operations and adjust to new business models. But in the absence of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report, which has gone dark amid the government shutdown, the layoff announcements have raised questions about the strength of the labor market and if it's the start of an AI-driven, white-collar recession. Some companies have outright said they're replacing workers with AI. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in May the company was able to shrink its head count by about 40%, in part because of AI. Duolingo said in April it'll stop using contractors for work that AI can handle. Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support roles in September, saying that AI can do 50% of the work at the company. But experts interviewed by CNBC said some companies could be \"AI-washing\" their job cuts, blaming layoffs on the new technology to cover up business fumbles and old-fashioned cost cutting. \"We spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and there's very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that we're talking about. In most cases, it doesn't cut head count at all,\" said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School and director of its Center for Human Resources. \"Using AI and introducing it to save jobs turns out to be an enormously complicated and time-consuming exercise. … There's still a perception that it's simple and easy and cheap to do, and it's really not.\" Still, the cuts, which come after a string of layoffs across the tech industry, have cast a dark cloud on a teetering economy that's been wracked by persistent inflation, rising delinquencies, falling consumer sentiment and an average effective tariff rate that's at its highest level in nearly a century, according to estimates from The Budget Lab at Yale University. The growing pile of bad news has done little to shock the stock market, which is at near-record highs, but that's largely because it's been buoyed in part by AI megacaps. Cappelli attributed the recent surge in layoff announcements to concerns about the state of the economy. He also noted a likely \"bandwagon\" effect in which companies see their competitors cutting so they too start making cuts. \"If it looks like everybody is cutting, then you say, 'They must know something we don't know,'\" said Cappelli. He added investors often reward cutting: \"They want to hear that you're cutting because it looks like you're doing something good. It looks like becoming more efficient.\" To be sure, AI and automation are potentially enabling some of the cuts, and the emerging technology is poised to help all companies reduce costs and boost efficiency in the coming years. But the reasons behind each layoff and the role AI is playing are nuanced, and vary company by company. Starbucks' decision to cut around 2,000 corporate jobs in two rounds this year is related to slowing sales at the company and a larger turnaround effort led by its new CEO, Brian Niccol. Layoffs at Meta's AI unit, which impacted around 600 jobs, came as the company said it wants to operate more nimbly and reduce layers. Intel's decision to lay off about 15% of its workforce came after it overinvested in chip manufacturing without adequate demand. Together, they represent what John Challenger, CEO of job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, described as a turning point in the economy and job market. \"We were in this no-hire, no-fire, type of zone. Economy was moving ahead. The labor markets were feeling pressure, but certainly, unemployment had stayed relatively strong,\" he said. \"These job cuts do suggest that the dam may be breaking as the economy slows.\" The earliest signals, he said, could be coming from retail, shipping and distribution. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon went on a hiring spree in part to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services, leading its corporate and front-line workforces to more than double to 1.3 million employees between 2019 and 2020. By 2021, the company had swelled to 1.6 million employees globally, the same year Andy Jassy succeeded Jeff Bezos as CEO. Since taking over, Jassy has been trying to undo some of that work. Last week's layoff announcement, impacting 14,000 corporate jobs, is expected to be the largest in the company's history and to affect nearly every unit in the company. It marks Amazon's second round of layoffs in three years and amounts to more than 41,000 corporate job cuts since 2022, with more potentially on the way come 2026. Though AI is part of the picture, there's more at work behind the reductions. Jassy said in the days following the announcement that the changes were neither AI nor financially driven, but were instead to cut corporate fat so the company can operate as the world's largest startup. Amazon said it's not replacing workers with AI, at least not yet, but it does need to cut employees so it can invest in the technology. As those costs come down, Amazon has earmarked hefty investments in cloud infrastructure to support AI workloads while simultaneously pushing out a flurry of AI services and tools across the company. It's contributed to a rise in capital expenditures, which are now expected to reach $125 billion this year, up from a prior forecast of $118 billion. Jassy said previously that the company's workforce would shrink in the future as a result of its embrace of generative AI but it still plans to keep hiring in \"key strategic areas.\" Over time, the company will need \"fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today\" but \"more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said in June. The cuts are also part of a larger goal of Jassy's to make the company more nimble, reduce bureaucracy and remove layers so it can operate faster and smarter. \"It's culture,\" Jassy said during Amazon's quarterly earnings call Thursday. \"If you grow as fast as we did for several years, you know, the size of the businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers.\" In January, UPS announced a major change in its strategy. The logistics firm said it was going to pare down its relationship with its largest customer, Amazon, in favor of higher-margin businesses that require fewer people to operate. In fiscal 2024, Amazon shipments represented nearly 12% of revenue for UPS. The logistics giant said it was planning to reduce that volume by more than half by June because of the relatively low margins. \"This was not their ask. This was us. This was UPS taking control of our destiny,\" CEO Carol Tomé told analysts in January. In turn, UPS said it was pivoting to more profitable businesses, like health care, returns and business-to-business services and as a result, would require fewer resources. \"As we bring volume down, we will not only reduce the hours of miles associated with this volume, we will be able to take out fixed costs to match our capacity to our new expected volume levels,\" finance chief Brian Dykes said in January. \"We expect to close up to 10% of our building, cut back our vehicle and aircraft fleets and reduce labor.\" Last week the company said it had deepened previously planned job cuts for a total of 48,000 roles eliminated so far this year across operational employees and office workers. In the first half of 2025, parcel volumes were down 5.4% at UPS compared with the year-ago period, according to data from ShipMatrix, and the company has been changing its corporate structure to adjust to lower volume. The bulk of its layoffs this year, representing 34,000 operational jobs, were related to its decision to close 93 buildings – not replace people with robotics, the company said. The 14,000 additional corporate roles it cut were partially related to AI, but the technology was not the primary driver, a spokesperson said. Where AI and automation are expected to hit UPS most is in its future hiring plans. As the company plans to bring automation to more of its facilities, it won't need to hire as many people. Last week, UPS said 66% of its volume during the fourth quarter would come through automated facilities, up from 63% a year prior. That number is expected to move higher in the years ahead. Still, that doesn't necessarily mean those jobs are disappearing – some could be migrating from UPS to other companies, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University's business school. Miller said there's a \"reallocation\" effect happening where one firm is losing business and shedding payroll — while another is gaining. The number of jobs may be the same, but the location, qualities and duties can differ, he said. BLS data on the number of people employed in \"courier\" positions, which covers roles at places like UPS and Amazon, reflects that trend. As of August, courier positions were only down about 2% from their all-time high, and they've been on the rise over the last three years, the data shows. Target's announcement last month that it would be cutting 1,800 jobs, representing about 8% of its corporate workforce, is a window into both consumer spending and the retailer's own specific challenges. It's Target's first major round of layoffs in a decade and comes after four years of roughly stagnant revenue. The retailer's incoming CEO, Michael Fiddelke, said the cuts are about reducing complexity at a company that's seen its workforce grow faster than sales. Unlike some of its competitors, the bulk of Target's revenue comes from the kinds of products that are nice to have, but not necessary, such as holiday mugs, trendy sweaters and home decor. That means when consumer spending starts to slow down, Target feels it more acutely than its rival Walmart, which earns the majority of its revenue from groceries. Slower consumer spending has been partially to blame for a decline in Target's performance in recent years, but the introduction of tariffs, which are pushing prices higher, could make that impact even worse. \"Buyers' willingness to pay is staying flat, inflation is high, income isn't going very up so firms' ability to sort of increase price to maintain their margin is being squeezed,\" said Daniel Keum, an associate professor of management at Columbia Business School, who studies labor market dynamics. \"If you can't increase price, you have to reduce cost. \"How operationally do I manage cost?\" Keum added. \"I mean No. 1, like, let's lay off white-collar people.\" Outside of macroeconomic conditions, Target's business has also suffered from a number of self-inflicted challenges. The quality of its merchandise has taken a dive, fewer staff and frequent out-of-stocks have made its stores less enjoyable to shop in, customers and insiders told CNBC earlier this year. The retailer has also struggled to manage its inventory, which has impacted its profitability. All of these issues combined have left Target with a workforce that has grown faster than sales and a complex corporate structure that has hampered decision-making and created needless red tape. Between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, Target's global workforce grew 6% from 415,000 employees to 440,000, but in the same time period, sales declined 0.8%, according to company filings. \"The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,\" Fiddelke told Target employees in a memo when announcing the job cuts. \"Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\" He didn't cite AI in his memo but did say the cuts will help the company execute faster so it can better \"accelerate technology.\" — CNBC's Melissa Repko and Steve Liesman contributed to this report.

    "headline": "Russia looks to cosy up with China after Trump’s meeting with Xi",
    "content": "Russian officials appeared eager Monday to reaffiirm Moscow's alliance with China following U.S. President Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Xi Jinping. Hot on the heels of Trump's talks with Xi last week, which the U.S. president described as \"amazing,\" Russia has now sent a large delegation of its own to China for deal-making and talks. Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin arrived in Hangzhou on Monday for two-day talks with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, with the officials signing a range of agreements, Russian state media reported, to deepen cooperation in the fields of trade, investment, energy, transport, agriculture and space. Calling his Chinese counterpart his \"dear friend,\" Mishustin said in comments reported by Russian state news agency Ria Novosti, that relations between Russia and China were \"at their highest level in their centuries-long history and continue to develop dynamically in all areas, despite various obstacles and illegal Western sanctions.\" For his part, Li Qiang said Beijing was ready to strengthen cooperation with Russia despite obstacles, although he did not specify what he was referring to. \"Despite new external risks and challenges in this process, China and Russia always support each other, build strategic contacts and interactions, and strive to jointly overcome difficulties,\" he said, TASS reported. He added that the partnership \"demonstrates that China and Russia are good neighbors and reliable partners who can always trust each other.\" China is Russia's most important and powerful international ally, with Beijing having refused to condemn Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the ongoing war, echoing Russia's rhetoric by calling the war a \"crisis.\" Just ahead of its invasion of Ukraine, Putin and Xi signed a \"no limits\" partnership and Russia has looked to leverage that alliance both in terms of geopolitical support and trade partnerships, to lessen the impact of Western sanctions which have curtailed its energy export market. Ahead of this week's trip, the Kremlin said it placed \"very great\" importance on the talks and it has certainly looked to reflect that in the delegation sent to Asia, with Mishustin accompanied by a range of top officials including his deputies and ministers of finance, agriculture, transport, economic development and trade. Space and nuclear energy officials were also in tow, with the director general of Roscosmos and head of Rosatom joining the delegation. Russian officials' two-day visit to China comes just days after Trump's high-profile meeting with Chinese President Xi last week in which he said the leaders had reached \"agreement on many issues.\" Xi, meanwhile, said Beijing and Washington should be \"partners and friends.\" In what was widely seen as a \"trade truce\" after months of escalating tensions over tariffs and counter-tariffs, Trump said he reached a 1-year agreement with China on rare earth supplies and he also cut fentanyl-linked tariffs on Beijing by half, taking overall duties on Chinese goods down to 47%. Moscow did not publicly comment on the meeting and was likely uncomfortable at the sight of its longtime ally China holding seemingly constructive (and reconstructive) talks with the U.S., with whom it has seen a sharp deterioration of relations in recent weeks. Trump pulled out of in-person talks that were due to take place with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he did not want to \"have a wasted meeting,\" signaling his frustration with Moscow over a lack of movement on the Ukraine war. Trump added that the summit had been canceled because \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere.\" Russia was non-plussed by the cancelation, with senior Russian officials blaming Western media and \"fake news\" for the jettisoned talks.

    "headline": "Tariffs are expected to show up more in prices as holiday shopping season starts",
    "content": "While the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season. President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year. While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower. \"There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher.\" Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins. Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding about half a percentage point to the core PCE measure the Federal Reserve uses when assessing inflation. With tariffs, BofA estimates that the inflation rate would be 2.9% in September, so without them that would mean a measure closer to 2.4%. The numbers are similar to ones Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited Wednesday. The core PCE on an annual basis was 2.9% in August. These percentage point differences matter to the Fed, which tries to keep core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 2%, a level it has been above since March 2021. Two Fed officials — regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Lorie Logan of Dallas — said Friday they did not agree with their colleagues' decision Wednesday to lower the central bank's key interest rate. For consumers, they also matter. Bhave estimates that shoppers are bearing about 50%-70% of total tariff costs, with businesses bearing the rest. In real-world terms, that's meant higher prices for things such as coffee, furniture and, recently, clothing prices, which jumped 0.7% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though they are minor components of the price indexes, they are items consumers buy frequently and can create perceptions about inflation, which can produce a self-reinforcing cycle that drives prices higher. \"Inflation in certain goods can have an outsized impact on consumer confidence, even if those items carry a negligible weight in the CPI basket,\" TD Cowen analysts said in a note. Price increases in items such as eggs create \"a constant, tangible feedback loop every week at the grocery store. Such items shape perception more than their statistical significance would suggest.\" The firm noted that this holiday season could see more of that sort of thing as artificial Christmas trees are almost all imported from China, which faces heavy costs under the Trump tariffs. \"While Artificial Christmas trees are not unique, they serve as a clear example of how high-tariff, seasonal goods can shape consumer perceptions of inflation,\" Cowen said. Had the duties been in place during the 2024 holiday season, shoppers would have spent an additional $40.6 billion, according to LendingTree estimates using data from multiple government and private sources. LendingTree's Budget Lab further estimates that some 70.5% of new tariffs were passed onto consumers in June 2025. \"That means that even more Americans would have had to fall back on credit cards and personal loans to help cover gift-buying expenses,\" said Matt Schultz, the firm's chief consumer finance analyst. \"That's the unfortunate reality that many people would have faced.\" Using the same estimates, LendingTree said the tariff cost comes to $132 per shopper.

    "headline": "European Central Bank holds rates steady as economy shows resilience",
    "content": "The European Central Bank has kept interest rates on hold, as expected, at its latest meeting on Thursday. The central bank held its key deposit facility rate at 2% for the third consecutive time, having last cut rates in June. The trim, which coincided with euro zone inflation hitting the ECB's target rate of 2%, was part of a rate-cutting cycle that has brought rates down from last year's record high of 4%. The ECB said in a statement Thursday that \"inflation remains close to the 2% medium-term target and the Governing Council's assessment of the inflation outlook is broadly unchanged.\" \"The economy has continued to grow despite the challenging global environment. The robust labour market, solid private sector balance sheets and the Governing Council's past interest rate cuts remain important sources of resilience,\" it said. It cautioned, however, that \"the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions.\" While the euro zone inflation rate inched up to 2.2% in September, up from 2% the previous month, the rise was attributed to an increase in services prices and economists had said the central bank was likely to remain cautious about meddling with rates right now. Expectations that the ECB would keep rates on hold were reinforced earlier Thursday when preliminary euro zone growth data showed the economy had grown 0.2% in the third quarter, from the previous three month period. The figure was above expectations and showed that economic activity remained resilient, despite prevailing uncertainty over business activity following U.S. trade tariffs. ECB President Christine Lagarde told reporters that while the services sector continued to grow — boosted by strong tourism and a pick-up in digital services — manufacturing had been \"held back by higher tariffs, still heightened uncertainty and a stronger euro.\" She added that the divergence between external and internal demand is \"likely to persist\" in the near term. \"The economy should benefit from consumers spending more as real incomes rise,\" Lagarde noted. \"From a monetary policy point of view, we are in a good place,\" Lagarde told CNBC's Annette Weisbach. \"Is it a fixed, good place? No. But we will do whatever is needed to make sure we stay in a good place.\" After the ECB's announcement, the euro reversed earlier gains to trade 0.26% below the dollar, at $1.1571. \"What a boring announcement,\" Mike Coop, chief investment officer of EMEA at Morningstar Wealth, told CNBC Thursday. \"It does belie the fact that inflation actually has gone back to being pretty much well behaved ... so it's hardly surprising that they're not feeling in a rush to change rates,\" he told CNBC's \"Decision Time.\" \"The bigger picture, I think, is that Europe is still adapting to the triple shocks of the removal of cheap energy, worse trade terms with the U.S. and the need to spend more on defense. On top of those three things, you also have now the U.S. sucking investment out of other parts of the world, so Europe hasn't had that stimulus, that we've seen in the U.S., to support growth,\" he told CNBC's Karen Tso. The central bank has repeatedly said it will take a meeting-by-meeting and data dependent approach to rate setting, and it repeated this stance on Thursday. However, top ECB board members told CNBC this month that the easing cycle is close to, or at its end. Martin Kocher, European Central Bank Governing Council member and governor at Austrian National Bank, said that as long as nothing \"drastic\" happens, Europe is \"OK.\" \"At the moment, I think we're in a good place. So, there's no reason to change anything, as long as there are no changes that force us to do something, Kocher said, speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington. \"And if you take the larger picture, yes, the easing cycle is close to an end or at its end, but there's no reason to pre-commit at that stage.\" In a separate interview, ECB Governing Council member François Villeroy de Galhau said he recommended \"agile pragmatism\" when it comes to the path for interest rates, adding: \"We are in a good position ... but a good position is not a fixed position.\" A majority of economists polled in mid-October by Reuters said the ECB would hold its deposit rate this year, while 45 of 79 economists polled (57%) saw no change by the end of 2026. — CNBC's Tasmin Lockwood and Leonie Kidd contributed reporting to this story.

    "headline": "Trump cuts fentanyl tariffs on China to 10% as Beijing delays latest rare earths curbs by a year",
    "content": "President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping emerged from a high-stakes meeting touting agreements on tariffs and export controls that amount to a tangible de-escalation of the contentious trade war between the two superpowers. But many details about what was achieved remain unclear, while other key sticking points in the U.S.-China trade relationship appear not to have come up at all. The overall U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports, meanwhile, will stay at a historically high level. The agreements struck during the meeting in Busan, South Korea, do not amount to a comprehensive trade deal — though Trump claimed after the meeting that one would be ready to sign \"pretty soon.\" He nevertheless hailed the summit with Xi as \"amazing,\" and rated it a 12 out of 10. It was the two leaders' first face-to-face meeting in six years. They spoke for one hour and 40 minutes. The top-line outcomes include an agreement by the U.S. to immediately cut fentanyl-related tariffs on China in half, to 10% from 20%. Trump told reporters on Air Force One after the meeting that he believes Xi is \"going to work very hard to stop the flow\" of the addictive opioid fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the U.S. China has repeatedly promised to reduce fentanyl trafficking to the U.S., but has been accused by experts of not following through. Trump did not provide additional details. A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in a translated statement that \"both sides reached consensus on issues such as cooperation in fentanyl control,\" without elaborating. Trump said the overall tariff rate on Chinese goods will fall to 47% from 57%. The tariff cut addresses \"a key Chinese grievance,\" said Han Shen Lin, China director at advisory firm The Asia Group, showing that \"Beijing's efforts to curb exports of fentanyl precursors, long unrecognized by Washington, are finally being acknowledged.\" Trump and Beijing also confirmed that China agreed to pause recently announced export controls on its valuable rare earths minerals for one year. Those controls were announced on Oct. 9, prompting a furious reply from Trump, who threatened to hike tariffs on China by 100% starting Saturday. The U.S. is dropping that tariff threat, Trump confirmed on Air Force One. He added that he believes that the one-year postponement of the Chinese export controls will be \"routinely extended.\" But the Chinese Commerce Ministry's statement says only that Beijing will suspend the measures for a year, and then \"study and refine specific plans.\" China also made no mention of other export control measures it had imposed earlier in the year, which remain in place. Chinese companies control the majority of the global supply chain for rare earths, which are critical for producing a range of products from semiconductors to missiles. Beijing has ramped up restrictions on exports of critical minerals over the last two years, with a particular focus on limiting their use for military purposes by other countries. \"China's leverage in rare earths and critical minerals processing will continue to surface episodically, effectively capping any escalation in bilateral tensions,\" Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said in a note Thursday. Trump also said \"tremendous amounts\" of U.S. soybeans and other farm products will be purchased by China \"starting immediately.\" China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans. Earlier this year it halted all purchases of the staple crop for months amid the tit-for-tat tariff war, costing American farmers billions of dollars in lost revenue. Ahead of the Trump-Xi summit, China-owned COFCO bought three U.S. soybean cargoes for December and January shipment, equating to about 180,000 metric tons of product — though experts note that is a fraction of prior years' purchases during the autumn harvest. By comparison, in October 2024 China bought nearly 6 million tons of U.S. soybeans, according to USDA data. For all of 2024, China purchased nearly 27 million tons. Soybeans are not specifically mentioned in the Chinese Commerce Ministry's statement, though it says both sides reached consensus on \"expanding agricultural trade.\" U.S. tariff investigations on China's maritime and shipbuilding industries, and Beijing's countermeasures, will also be delayed for one year, the Chinese government said after the meeting. Trump said he will be going to China in April, followed by Xi's trip to the U.S., without specifying a timeline for his Chinese counterpart. Multiple key issues went unaddressed in the meeting, Trump said. On the sale of Nvidia's chips to China, Trump said the two sides had discussed \"a lot of chips,\" but not the most advanced Blackwell chips. \"They are going to be talking to Nvidia and others about taking chips,\" he said. Taiwan was not part of the discussion, Trump said. The two leaders also avoided the subject of Chinese purchasing of Russian oil, a financial lifeline to the Kremlin as it continues to wage war in Ukraine. \"Ukraine came up very strongly,\" Trump said, but \"we didn't really discuss the oil.\"' Trump also gave no hint that he and Xi had struck a deal to keep the popular social media app TikTok from going dark in the U.S. China's government said it would \"work with the U.S. to properly resolve issues related to TikTok.\" Global stocks were lower and gold prices rose 1.2% as investors assessed the ramifications of the trade truce, which comes after several months of economic confrontation. While the trade truce is \"welcome news,\" any indication of addressing underlying structural matters of concern is missing — such as China's industrial excess capacity and nonmarket economy practices — said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute. That means that the truce is \"fragile and tensions are certain to heat up again,\" Cutler added. Before the meeting, the two leaders struck a conciliatory tone, with Trump calling Xi \"an old friend\" with whom he has a \"very good relationship,\" and Xi stressing that China's economic growth ambitions would not undermine Trump's vision to \"Make America Great Again.\" Tensions between the world's two economic superpowers have been on a boil this year. The latest escalation came this month, with Beijing export controls and Washington threatening to ban software-powered exports to China. The U.S. had in recent days shared details about deals it hoped to achieve with China – from restricting the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. to TikTok's divestiture from its Beijing-based parent ByteDance. Tariffs, tech curbs and rare earths were also on the table for discussion. Heading into the meeting, Xi shook hands with Trump at the photo-op at Gimhae Air Base in Busan, urging that Washington and Beijing be \"friends and partners\" in his opening remarks. Sitting across the table from Trump, the Chinese leader said that it was a \"great pleasure\" to meet the U.S. president for the sixth time, adding that it was only \"normal\" for the two economic superpowers to have \"frictions now and then.\" \"China's development goes hand in hand with your vision to Make America Great Again,\" Xi said, according to a readout by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. That conciliatory tone marked a notable shift from Xi's meeting with the former U.S. President Joe Biden late last year, during which the speech highlighted more \"inevitable competition\" between the two countries, said Yue Su, principal economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit. While the agreement still lacks a \"strong structural foundation\" and could easily be reversed, both sides are likely to stick with it in the near term to signal goodwill, Su added. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.

    "headline": "‘Partners and friends’: Xi strikes conciliatory tone as he meets Trump in South Korea",
    "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping said Thursday that Beijing and Washington should be \"partners and friends,\" at his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on addressing trade and tariff concerns. The meeting concluded in about one hour and 40 minutes, according to Chinese state media, with the two leaders shaking hands before leaving the venue without making public comments. This is the first time the two leaders met in person since Trump began his second term in January. \"We are gonna have a very successful meeting,\" Trump said at the photo-op with Xi before walking into the meeting. While calling Xi \"a very tough negotiator,\" Trump played up his ties with the Chinese leader, saying that \"we've always had a very good relationship.\" When asked whether the two leaders would finalize a trade deal at the meeting, Trump said \"could be. We'll have a great understanding.\" In his opening remarks, Xi said it was \"normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then,\" while urging both sides to work together and \"ensure the steady sailing forward of the giant ship\" of bilateral relations, according to a statement released by the Chinese foreign ministry. Xi also lauded Trump's efforts aimed at solving regional conflicts while stressing China's role in promoting peace talks on various issues. The Trump administration earlier this month had hinted that China played a limited role in Thailand and Cambodia ceasefire talks. \"Although the meeting itself is not about peace, [Xi] is mostly trying to create an atmosphere conducive to a deal,\" said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. The high-stakes meeting comes as tensions between the world's two largest economies have been on the boil this year. The latest escalation came this month, with Beijing export controls and Washington threatening to ban software-powered exports to China. The U.S. in recent days has shared details about deals they hope to achieve with China – from restricting the flow of fentanyl to the U.S. to TikTok's divestiture from its Beijing-based parent ByteDance. Tariffs, tech curbs and rare earths are also on the table for discussion. Beijing had been more circumspect about the prospects of an agreement, but in a possible sign of thawing relationship, China bought its first cargoes of U.S. soybeans in several months, Reuters reported Wednesday. The Trump-Xi meeting may be more of a \"tactical pause than a strategic breakthrough\" with both sides contesting with disagreements core to the U.S.-China rivalry, including technology controls, supply chain and security frictions, said Han Shen Lin, China director at advisory firm The Asia Group. \"A temporary truce is better than an uncontrolled trade war,\" Lin added. Xi is in South Korea – his first state visit in 11 years – from Thursday to Saturday to attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Gyeongju. Shortly before the meeting started, Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he had instructed the Pentagon to restart nuclear weapons testing, claiming that the U.S. has the world's largest nuclear arsenal, followed by Russia and China. The remarks were \"bold and disruptive,\" Lin said, adding that Trump was \"forcing the room to focus on U.S. leverage\" ahead of the meeting. \"If it lands a trade win, it's genius; if it poisons the well, we're in for frostier summits ahead.\" Investors are cautiously watching for headlines from Busan as the trade war between the U.S. and China has kept investors on edge. Global markets soared at the start of the week on growing optimism that the U.S. and China could near an agreement on trade. \"A return to dialogue and engagement — no matter the near-term results — is critical to moving the U.S.-China relationship forward in the long term,\" said Curtis Chin, chair of senior fellows at the Milken Institute, also a former U.S. ambassador to the Asian Development Bank. That said, \"headline-making deals and meetings will need to be followed by well-executed implementation and fulfillment of commitments by both sides,\" said Chin. Got a confidential news tip?

    "headline": "From futuristic NEOM to tech and tourism, Saudi Arabia's priorities are shifting",
    "content": "When Saudi Arabia first announced plans to reinvent its oil-based economy, huge infrastructure projects like the futuristic region NEOM and smart city The Line were championed as central to the transformation. Almost a decade on from the launch of its \"Vision 2030\" transformation strategy, however, and Riyadh's priorities have shifted with the times. Now, technology and artificial intelligence are key priorities for the kingdom. \"We're reprioritizing a little bit towards sectors that need it the most, and today it's technology, artificial intelligence,\" Faisal Alibrahim, Saudi's economy minister, told CNBC Wednesday. \"We want to move into an economic structure that is productivity-led and at the heart of productivity is technology, innovation and generative AI,\" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh. Riyadh's Vision 2030 strategy to diversify its economy away from oil has seen it invest heavily in tourism, cultural and sports events, technology and infrastructure. \"Our primary objective is non-oil growth and non-oil growth has been steadily increasing, this is our main driver of economic growth,\" Alibrahim said, noting that non-oil activities now represent 56% of total real GDP in Saudi Arabia. \"All of our transformation efforts are to achieve non-oil growth so we can diversify our economy from having to rely on a single commodity price and how big the government budget is, but also to rely on private sector dynamism and to be ready for the future.\" Alibrahim said sectors like tourism had been performing far better than expected, with targets set for 2030 achieved years in advance, prompting the kingdom to up its target to 150 million visitors by the end of the decade, he said. A key pillar of the Vision 2030 program is the creation of NEOM, an urban development project with a futuristic, car-free and zero-carbon city called The Line at its center. It's estimated that the entire NEOM project will cost $1.5 trillion, with The Line seen costing around $500 billion, but Saudi Arabia has looked to cut costs in recent years as its budget deficit has grown amid lower oil prices. Alibrahim said \"agility\" and the ability to shift priorities and amend plans had become key parts of Vision 2030, noting that \"the minute these plans aren't solving for your optimal outcomes is the minute you need to re-plan and adjust.\" This shift in priorities has seen the technology, innovation and artificial intelligence sectors become more important areas of focus. Abdulelah Albarrak, partner for government and public institutions at Oliver Wyman, agreed that Saudi's economic plans had to respond technological change. \"Plans have to remain agile and responsive to changes in evolving technologies, in emerging technologies that really dictate change. It goes without saying these giga and mega projects have a significant economic and socio-economic impact in growing the nation, in driving and cultivating new sectors, but also the emergence of AI and other emerging trends require a lot of focus,\" he said. Alibrahim told CNBC that Saudi was now seen as a land of opportunity for investors, as well as investment. \"People here stopped coming to Saudi to take money, they're coming here to make money,\" he said. \"Saudi stopped being only a source of capital to [being] also a capital of real economic opportunities,\" he added. \"We're just unlocking the potential.\" In September, the Saudi finance ministry estimated in a pre-budget statement that the budget deficit for 2026 will be 3.3% of GDP and that it was comfortable with that level. \"The government will continue to adopt expansionary spending policies that are contrary to the economic cycle, and [which are] directed towards national priorities with social and economic impact, and in a way that contributes to achieving the goals of the Saudi's Vision 2030, and diversifying the economic base,\" the ministry said in a statement. It also forecast that the economy would expand 4.4% in 2025, which it said was supported by the growth of non-oil activities, and by 4.6% in 2026. On Wednesday, Alibrahim upgraded the 2025 forecast, stating that the kingdom's 2025 real GDP growth will be 5.1%. Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister Mohammed Aljadaan has played down concerns over Saudi Arabia's growing debt pile (albeit a relatively low one of 32% of GDP) and deficit. \"The ratio of public debt to GDP is still at relatively low levels compared to many other economies, and that it is within safe limits compared to the size of the economy, and is supported by financial reserves,\" the minister said. — CNBC's Dan Murphy contributed reporting to this story.

    "headline": "Trump’s rare earth deals target China’s dominance — here’s why change won’t come soon",
    "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump's push to secure rare earth supply deals across Asia will ultimately weaken China's dominance in the global supply chain for critical minerals — but analysts said the buildup will take years. Over 10 days, Trump cemented deals with Australia, Malaysia, Cambodia and most recently, Japan, to bolster the supply of rare earths and other critical minerals that are crucial for the making of batteries, automobiles, defense systems and computing chips. The flurry of deals — part of Washington's bid to counter Beijing's chokehold on the sector — comes ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan on Thursday. The deals may \"benefit immensely from being linked together in a plurilateral agreement with strong commitments, financing and pooling of resources,\" said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute. She expects more of such deals to follow under the Trump administration. Trump and Xi are expected to address several contentious issues that have stalled the long-running trade talks, including Beijing's rare earth export controls and Washington's tariff threats and technology restrictions. The most recent win for Trump was an agreement with Japan aimed at securing the supply of raw and processed critical minerals while also pledging funding for selected projects within the next six months. Earlier pacts with Australia, Malaysia and Thailand also outlined multibillion-dollar plans, commitments to fair trade practices and to avoid export bans or quotas. While Trump's deals will bring much-needed financial support to the industry and may eventually challenge Beijing's stranglehold over rare earths, experts said the efforts will be costly and take years to bear fruit. \"What we are trying to do now is to get off the Chinese as the primary supply chain, but that will take time,\" said Dennis Wilder, a former senior U.S. intelligence official and now a senior fellow at Georgetown University. \"In the medium term, we will get off the Chinese supply chain, but in the short term, there's still a great deal of dependency on China,\" Wilder stressed. Goldman Sachs estimates new rare earth mines tend to take up to a decade to develop, with known reserves for certain elements \"very scarce\" outside of Myanmar and China, while building refineries would take about 5 years. China dominates 69% of the market share for rare earth mining, 92% of refining and 98% of magnet manufacturing, the bank estimates. These deals are a \"game-changer\" that could reduce the U.S. vulnerabilities to Beijing's export controls, stabilize rare earth prices and accelerate domestic innovative refining and recycling, said Brodie Sutherland, CEO of Patriot Critical Minerals Corp, a U.S.-based critical minerals developer. With assured access to raw materials from friendly nations, American firms can focus on efficient extraction, ethical mining and value-added processing, said Sutherland. He also cited longer-term benefits such as lower risk premiums on financing, faster permitting for new sites and a \"level playing field against subsidized foreign competitors.\" China has allowed rare earth prices to swing in very \"strategic\" ways to make projects in other countries unprofitable, said Mike Rosenberg, a professor of strategic management at IESE Business School. Efforts to diversify and reshore production, however, will inevitably mean accepting some environmental tradeoffs, experts said. Mining and refining rare earth materials in an ecologically friendly way is \"very, very expensive,\" Rosenberg noted, while China kept costs low by limiting environmental controls. \"Consumers may need to accept higher prices for electronics and green technologies that reflect their true material and environmental cost,\" said Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Center at Chatham House. The policy push has also fueled a rally in several U.S.-listed rare earth miners this year. New York-listed shares of MP Materials and Trilogy Metals have each more than quadrupled, Energy Fuels has tripled, while Critical Metals is up nearly 90% and USA Rare Earth about 75%, according to LSEG data. Trump likely rushed to sign these deals to gain leverage ahead of his meeting with Xi in Seoul this week, analysts said. U.S. officials said earlier this week that they expected China to delay imposing export controls on critical minerals for a year as part of a broader trade deal, briefly cooling a rally in mining stocks. \"Beijing's latest threat on sweeping extraterritorial export restrictions in this sector has served as a needed wake-up call to partners around the world,\" said Asia Society Policy Institute's Cutler. China may have miscalculated with the export controls that rattled the global economy and widened the trade war to include other nations, said Wilder of Georgetown University, noting that \"it wasn't in China's interest.\" \"It was a useful weapon when it was targeted at the U.S., but it becomes less useful when you try and expand that to the rest of the world,\" Wilder said. \"Because then you bring the rest of the world over to the U.S. in many ways.\" Got a confidential news tip?
