Baldwin Arena on Monday night. The Owls (1-0) battled back from a late second half deficit versus the Eagles (0-1) to tie the game and missed just one shot in the extra five minutes to start the season with a victory, their first over a power conference team at home since December of 2002 against Miami. FIRST HALF A nearly full court pass to a wide-open redshirt sophomore guard Devin Vanterpool for the slam dunk opened the Owls' scoring. A 12-3 Owls run, highlighted by nine points from junior Xander Pintelon, gave FAU a nine-point lead. A three-pointer by redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams put Florida Atlantic up by 10 for the first time of the night.
