    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Behind three touchdowns from Easton Messer and three takeaways from the defense, the Florida Atlantic football team defeated Tulsa in Saturday afternoon's Homecoming game at Flagler Credit Union Stadium by a score of 40-21. The Owls (4-5, 3-3) dropped 40 points at home for the third time this season with a complete game on both sides of the ball against the Golden Hurricane (2-7, 0-6), winning the turnover margin battle 3-1. VIDEO RECAP THE BEGINNING Starting out on defense, redshirt senior DB Terez Reid picked off a pass on the fourth play of the game, the Owls' first interception of the year. FAU's first drive on offense culminated in a 39-yard field goal by Garrison Smith, extending its program record to six consecutive games with a score on the opening possession. After a goal-line stand on defense, redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp continued his growing connection with redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt, hitting him down the sideline where Platt took it 47 yards for a touchdown and a 10-0 lead. THE TURNING POINT Following two Tulsa field goals early in the second, Veltkamp found a wide-open Messer for a 44-yard score to up the score to 17-6, the first of 21 unanswered points to close the half. It was then redshirt senior DB Damarius McGhee's turn to make a game-changing play, scooping up a fumble at the goal line and returning it 95 yards for the score. With the defense back on the field, senior DB Chris Keys Jr. made an interception to give it right back to the Owls, setting up the second score to Messer on an 11-yard strike to send FAU to the locker room up 31-6. THE FINISH After a quiet third quarter, a drive commanded by graduate QB Zach Gibson gave the Owls 40. A 30-yard grab from Platt on 4th-and-one flea flicker set up Messer's nine-yard score, his third of the day. Two sacks – one by junior DE Deshaun Batiste and the other by freshman DE Josh Roberts – kept Tulsa out of the end zone the rest of the way. OFFENSE Messer's hat trick was the first multi-score game of his collegiate career. He becomes just the sixth receiver in program history to haul in three touchdown catches in a single game. For the second week in a row, Platt recorded a 100+ yard receiving game with 114 on five catches. Sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton logged the first 100+ yard game of his career, with 107 yards on just 11 carries. He ripped off a 50-yard run, the longest of his career, to end the first quarter. DEFENSE McGhee's 95-yard fumble return is the second longest in program history, yardage not seen since the second game in the 2001 inaugural season. Leading the way in tackles was redshirt junior Leon Hart Jr. with 12. Redshirt junior LB Tyler Stolsky recorded 11 tackles, his fourth straight game in double digits. In addition to the three takeaways, the Owls' defensive unit forced three turnovers-on-downs, and recorded five sacks, eight tackles for loss and six pass breakups POSTGAME AUDIO Hagerty Family Head Football Coach Zach Kittley Redshirt Junior QB Caden Veltkamp Graduate QB Zach Gibson Redshirt Junior WR Easton Messer Redshirt Junior WR Jayshon Platt Graduate OL Alex Atcavage Redshirt Senior DB Terez Reid Redshirt Senior DB Damarius McGhee PHOTO GALLERY Gallery: (11-8-2025) Tulsa at Florida Atlantic UP NEXT The Owls will travel for their final road game of the 2025 season, heading to New Orleans for a matchup with Tulane on Saturday, Nov. 15.
