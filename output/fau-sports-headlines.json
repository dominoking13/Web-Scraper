    "content": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Florida Atlantic's men's basketball team is heading to the Sunshine Slam's championship game after defeating Loyola Marymount by a score of 64-52 on Monday night at the Ocean Center. The Owls (5-1) delivered the Lions' (6-1) their first loss of the season in the tournament's semifinal matchup behind junior guard Kanaan Carlyle's second consecutive 20-point outing and redshirt sophomore Devin Vanterpool with another all-around performance highlighted by his 14 points and a relentless defensive effort. FIRST HALF The Owls jumped out to an early lead with Carlyle, whose momentum carried over from the previous game, with a four-point play three minutes in. FAU's lead grew to as much as 13 before LMU went on a run to close the gap to four. An offensive drought was ended by a ferocious driving dunk from Xander Pintelon, part of a perfect first half from the field for the junior forward. The hot shooting start continued up to the final buzzer, with Vanterpool drilling an attempt from beyond the arc in the closing seconds to send the Owls into the locker room with a 41-34 lead. SECOND HALF LMU worked its way back into the game, cutting the deficit to four in the opening minutes of the final period. The Owls never surrendered the lead, responding with a 12-2 run over the course of four minutes to go up by 11. The Lions had one more run in them to trail by two with just under 10 minutes remaining, but Florida Atlantic soon built its lead back up to double digits, this time from attacking the paint. An explosive sequence by Vanterpool on both ends of the floor ensued, soaring for a two-handed block to deny a dunk attempt despite a four-inch height disadvantage, and then swishing a step-back jumper. It was all FAU the rest of the way, surrendering just two field goals to the Lions in the final five minutes. PRESS CONFERENCE GALLERY Gallery: (11-24-2025) MBB vs. LMU STATS & NOTES For the third time in four seasons, Florida Atlantic has won four out of its first five games. The Owls have not trailed at any point in their last four victories. With 24 points, Carlyle reached a new FAU career high for the second straight game. Redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams, the team's leader in blocks, totaled three in the first half and finished the night with a career high of four. Pintelon hauled in nine rebounds, the most by an Owl on the season. The team won the rebounding battle over the Lions 42-29.

The Owls improve to 3-3 overall, and Air Force falls to 3-4 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED Air Force opened the contest on an 8-4 run, but the Owls answered back with an 8-4 run of their own, capped off by Vivian Onugha's first basket of the day, to tie things up at 12-12 with just under three minutes remaining in the first. FAU took the lead at 17-14, but an Air Force triple tied the back-and-forth contest at 17-all to close the first. The Falcons retook the lead to open the second, 21-17. Destyne Jackson brought the Owls back within two at 21-17 at the 7:40-minute mark. Air Force capitalized on numerous FAU errors as the Falcons went on a 13-4 run to hold a 13-point lead with 2:37 to go in the half.

The Owls maintained their advantage, but a late Air Force triple closed out the 76-71 contest in favor of the Owls. HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND \"I felt like we fought really hard to get back in the game. We started out extremely flat, which I believe is due to the physicality of the game on Monday, so we had to get refocused at half. Our full-court pressure definitely got us back in the game and enabled us to force the turnovers we needed to score some easy buckets. NOTES AND TEAM STATS Three Owls finished in double figures in the win. Moors led the way for the Owls with a team-high 15 points, shooting 57 percent (4-of-7) from the field, 50 percent (1-of-2) from 3-point range, and going a perfect 100 percent (6-of-6) at the line.

    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Following the conclusion of the 2025 season, four players on the Florida Atlantic football team have been recognized on the American's All-Conference teams, announced by the league on Tuesday. Redshirt senior Jackson Lee is one of two deep snappers named to the first team. Redshirt junior WR Easton Messer earned a spot on the second team while redshirt junior DL CJ Doggette Jr. and LB Leon Hart Jr. received third team honors. Lee was part of a special teams operation that achieved the highest field goal percentage in program history (84.2%) and was a perfect 36-for-36 on extra point attempts, keeping alive Florida Atlantic's streak dating back to 2021. He also snapped for punter Logan Lupo, who finished third in the American regular season by averaging 45.0 yards per punt. Lee also contributed to an Owl two-point conversion, successfully catching a pass in the end zone on a trick play. Messer is on the all-conference second team after achieving one of the greatest seasons by a wideout in Florida Atlantic history. He finished the regular season as the nation's leader in receptions (104) and finished second in the American in receiving yards (1,052). He totaled eight touchdowns, six receiving, one rushing, and one passing, the first Owl in program history to record all three types of scores in one season. His receptions rank second all-time in a single season for FAU, and his receiving yards is third all-time. Doggette Jr. and Hart Jr. were forces for a defensive front that racked up 68 tackles for loss, fifth in the conference. Doggette Jr. led the Owls in both TFLs (seven) and sacks (four), while Hart added 4.5 including a sack. He logged 96 total tackles, most by an Owl since Jordan Helm in 2021, despite only playing in 11 games, and tied for 29th in the nation in tackles per game (8.7).
