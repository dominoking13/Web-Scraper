    "content": "TAMPA, Fla. – Florida Atlantic men's soccer (10-3-1, 5-1-1) will have a chance to win the American Conference regular season title on Sunday night. The Owls outlasted USF (8-2-5, 4-2-1) in a 4-3 thriller on Wednesday to remain tied for first place in the league standings. Both teams were awarded a penalty kick in the first half, and both teams converted. First, it was USF in the 40th minute after an FAU handball on the edge of the box. Three minutes later, at the other end of the field, Mamadou Diarra was taken down in the penalty area and Oliver Moller-Jensen stepped forward to tie the game from the spot. The match went into halftime tied 1-1 before chaos took over in the final half hour. In the 61st minute, Felipe Santos found space well outside the box and picked the far corner for his first goal as an Owl. Less than a minute later, USF was awarded another penalty kick, this time for a foul in the box. They converted again to tie it 2-2. The Bulls then regained the lead in the 71st minute, but the advantage didn't last long. Four minutes after falling behind, Aboubacar Traore found himself on the other end of a Sebastian Zettl free kick and redirected home his fourth goal of the season to equalize 3-3. The Owls kept the pressure on in the final quarter of an hour and were rewarded with a last-minute winner. With 15 seconds left, Diarra found Zettl at the top of the penalty area, and the senior captain had just enough time and space to get a shot off. The strike beat the USF keeper to the bottom corner, stunning the home crowd and giving the Owls a shocking 4-3 road victory. Sebastian Zettl... AKA CAPTAIN CLUTCH!!! #WIP🏝️@FAUAthletics | @American_Conf | @NCAASoccer pic.twitter.com/CKd685pWde — Florida Atlantic Men's Soccer (@FAUMSoccer) October 30, 2025 The victory secures the Owls a first-round bye in the American Conference tournament and keeps them in contention for the regular season crown. To achieve the latter, they'll need more points on Sunday against Tulsa than Charlotte earns against Missouri State (i.e., if the Bears beat the 49ers, FAU needs just a tie). Kickoff between Florida Atlantic and Tulsa is set for 7 p.m. on Sunday at the FAU Soccer Stadium. Admission is free.

Horan was named All-Conference Second Team after leading the Owls with seven assists on the season for a career high. \"Michelle concludes her college career as one of the most exciting attacking players in FAU history.

Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. All fans are encouraged to wear red to support the \"RED OUT\" theme. ABOUT THE OWLS A win over Tulsa would secure the Owls at least a share of the American Conference regular season title. A win + a Charlotte tie or loss vs. Missouri State and the Owls would have sole possession of the regular season title. If Charlotte loses, the Owls can tie Tulsa and still win the title outright. Prior to Sunday's game, 11 seniors will be recognized: Guilherme Pipolo, Eli Conway, Ednilson Voiles, Matthew Alfred, Enzo Rabot, Kerfalla Toure, Aboubacar Traore, Jozo Cancar, Andreas Raisanen, Fabrizio Cubeddu, and Sebastian Zettl. Traore, Zettl, and Mamadou Diarra each had an assist vs. USF -- the trio is now tied for third in program history with 15 for their respective careers. The record is 19. The Owls are looking to join the 2007, 2003, and 1989 teams with 11 wins in a season (3rd-most in a single season). 13 is the single-season record set by the 1996 team. ABOUT THE GOLDEN HURRICANE Tulsa is sixth in the American Conference standings and is hoping to secure one of the final spots in the postseason tournament. The Golden Hurricane is coming off a 0-0 draw with Missouri State on Wednesday. SERIES HISTORY The Owls will be looking for their first win over Tulsa. The Golden Hurricane lead the all-time series 4-0. WHAT'S NEXT The Owls have secured a first-round bye in the American Conference tournament.
