    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Late game heroics from freshman Yohann Sissoko lifted the Florida Atlantic men's basketball team past Boston College in an 83-78 overtime win at Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena on Monday night. The Owls (1-0) battled back from a late second half deficit versus the Eagles (0-1) to tie the game and missed just one shot in the extra five minutes to start the season with a victory, their first over a power conference team at home since December of 2002 against Miami. FIRST HALF A nearly full court pass to a wide-open redshirt sophomore guard Devin Vanterpool for the slam dunk opened the Owls' scoring. A 12-3 Owls run, highlighted by nine points from junior Xander Pintelon, gave FAU a nine-point lead. A three-pointer by redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams put Florida Atlantic up by 10 for the first time of the night. Boston College closed the deficit to one, but junior guard Kanaan Carlyle hit a late three-pointer to give the Owls a 35-31 advantage entering halftime. SECOND HALF Six straight points from Isaiah Elohim built Florida Atlantic's lead, with the redshirt sophomore guard putting together a highlight reel sequence of plays featuring a driving slam dunk followed by an acrobatic and-one. The Eagles tied the game with 10 minutes remaining and soon took a six-point lead off the 8-0 run. Boston College was up by nine with under five minutes left, but the lead was cut to three in less than a minute with back-to-back three pointers from Sissoko and Carlyle. Down by five with 46 seconds to play, the Owls forced a turnover to get the ball back, with Carlyle drawing the foul and sinking two free throws to cut the score to 66-63. The Eagles did not have an opportunity to close out the game, with Sissoko intercepting a pass and drilling a shot from beyond the arc to tie the score at 66 apiece with 31 seconds on the clock. Neither team scored again, sending the game into overtime. OVERTIME The duo of Carlyle and Sissoko came up clutch once again, with the former sinking a three to tie it at 78-78 and a driving layup from Sissoko to take a lead that the Owls did not relinquish. A three-pointer from Pintelon with just over a minute to go put Florida Atlantic up by six, sealing the victory.
