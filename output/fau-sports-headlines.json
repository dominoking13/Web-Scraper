    "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. – Florida Atlantic men's soccer saw its season come to an end on Thursday night in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. The Owls mounted a furious second half rally before ultimately falling short in a 3-2 defeat to UCF. The Knights advance to face Georgetown in the second round on Sunday. The Owls owned possession early and had four corner kicks inside the first 10 minutes. The Knights opened the scoring, however, with their first shot on goal in the 15th minute. They doubled the lead in the 24th minute to take a 2-0 advantage into halftime. The visitors cut the deficit to one early in the second half. Oliver Moller-Jensen saved a ball from going over the end line for a goal kick. Mamadou Diarra picked up the loose ball and sent a pass across the six-yard box, where Andreas Raisanen ripped a side-volley past the UCF keeper to make it 2-1. UCF responded just four minutes later to reassert a two-goal lead with 30 minutes to play in the match. The Owls made one final push inside the last 10 minutes. Aboubacar Traore's cross found Diarra, who headed home his ninth goal of the season to make it 3-2 with 9:50 on the clock. In the 88th minute, Eli Conway's shot from the top of the penalty area caromed off the left post and across the goal line but stayed out. That would be the final chance for Florida Atlantic. The final shot count was 14-11 in favor of UCF, with eight on goal compared to six for the Owls. Goalkeeper Alfred Mikkelsen finished with three saves.

    "headline": "Owls Fall at South Alabama",
    "content": "MOBILE, Ala. – The Florida Atlantic Owls fell short on the road at South Alabama on Thursday, dropping a 70-63 contest at the Mitchell Center. The Owls fall to 2-2, while South Alabama improves to 4-1 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED The Owls started off hot as a fast break layup from Jess Moors capped off a 10-1 opening run with FAU leading by nine at the opening media break. Grace Carstensen's first triple of the day kept the Owls' lead at six, 15-9, with just under two minutes to play in the first, but the Jaguars closed the quarter on a 6-1 run to cut the FAU lead to just one, 16-15, at the end of the first. The two squads traded baskets to open the second, battling through three ties to a 22-22 stalemate with 4:41 to play in the half. The Jaguars went on an 8-3 scoring run to hold a five-point advantage, 30-25, with 1:28 to go in the half. However, Carstensen knocked down her second triple of the day to make it a one-possession game at the break, 30-28. Vivian Onugha tied things back up at 30-30 off a layup to open the third. A pair of free throws from Moors kept things within one, 33-32, through the 7:11-minute mark. However, the Jaguars then scored 13 unanswered points to take their first double-figure lead of the night, 46-32. The Owls started to battle back, cutting the lead to eight, 51-43, with a minute to play in the third, but USA scored four more to close out the quarter, making it 55-43 entering the final 10 minutes of play. The Jaguars knocked down a three to open the fourth, pushing their lead to its largest of the night at 15, 58-43. South Alabama maintained a 15-point advantage through a 63-48 lead with 4:41 remaining. The Owls rallied late on a 13-2 run to cut the Jaguars' lead to just four, 65-61, with 1:27 to play, but a couple of costly turnovers caused the Owls' rally to fall just short as South Alabama took the contest, 70-63. HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND \"Disappointing loss to South Alabama. Their pressure and size definitely influenced our performance. We turned the ball over way too much and didn't execute as well as we needed to compete in their arena. We just have to get better.\" NOTES AND TEAM STATS Four Owls scored in double-figures, led by Onugha with a game-best 17 points, shooting 55 percent (6-of-11) from the field and 83 percent (5-of-6) from the line. Moors and Destyne Jackson tied with 11 points apiece, and Michiyah Simmons rounded out the Owls' double-figure scorers with 10 points on the night. Jackson dished out a game-high three assists to lead the team. Moors led the Owls in steals, collecting a season-high six. Haley Walker led the Owls on the glass, collecting a team-high six rebounds.

HOW IT HAPPENED The Owls held the 9-7 advantage early, capped off by a kill from Libby Ashline. After battling through three ties to a 12-12 stalemate, Tulsa produced a 5-1 run, taking a 17-13 lead, sparking a pair of timeouts from the Owls. Florida Atlantic kept things within five at 21-16, but the Golden Hurricane closed the frame on a 4-1 run to take the opening set, 25-17.

Out of the break, the Owls started to rally, outscoring the Golden Hurricane 13-7 to cut the deficit to one and force Tulsa to call a timeout. Emsley Venard knotted things up at 20-20 out of the break with an ace. The Owls eventually closed out the set after capping off a 13-3 run to take the 25-21 win and send the game to a fourth set, 2-1. The Owls kept the fourth close, battling through a 9-7 Tulsa advantage to open the set, however, the Golden Hurricane started to break away once more, holding a 13-8 lead as the Owls called their first timeout of the fourth. FAU went on a 3-0 run off a kill from Maggie Allred and a pair of Tulsa errors to cut the deficit to two, 13-11. However, Tulsa responded with an 8-2 run to extend its lead to eight at 21-13.

    "headline": "Owls Fall in Waning Seconds to UConn, 48-45",
    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – In a game featuring nearly 1,300 yards of combined offense and four second half lead changes, the Florida Atlantic football team fell just short to UConn on Saturday evening at Flagler Credit Union Stadium, 48-45. The Owls' (4-7) 300th game in program history came down to each team's final drive, but the Huskies (9-4) held on for the three-point win. VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF After trading field goals on each team's respective first possession, UConn scored touchdowns on its next three opening-quarter series to take a 24-3 lead. To start the second, FAU redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp made good on two passes before giving it off to redshirt junior WR Easton Messer for a 39-yard rushing touchdown. After forcing a Huskies punt, Veltkamp capped off a drive by taking it in himself, going head over heels into the end zone for a 17-yard score to make it a one-possession game at 24-17. UConn would add a late field goal to take a 27-17 lead into the locker room. SECOND HALF The Owls' momentum carried over into the third quarter, with back-to-back touchdowns to pull ahead for the first time. The first was a rushing score from 11 yards out by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton; the second, on 4th-and-1 from their own 10, saw Veltkamp hit redshirt junior wideout Dominique Henry in stride on a quick slant, and he took it 90 yards to put FAU up 31-27. UConn regained the advantage on two straight scores of its own, and led 41-31 with 10:11 to go in the game. But the Owls fought back once again. With 7:13 left, on 4th-and-11, Veltkamp found Messer over the middle for a 33-yard touchdown, and five minutes later, Veltkamp scampered into the end zone for his second rushing score of the game, from 11 yards out. With 2:11 left, FAU led 45-41. On the ensuing possession, the Huskies put together a 15-play, 75-yard drive for the fourth lead change of the second half. The Owls got the ball back with 22 seconds left, and Veltkamp marched the Owls into field goal range with two quick first-down completions. But the game-tying field goal attempt from 36 yards at the horn was wide left, and UConn survived. OFFENSE Veltkamp finished the game 42-for-55 for 494 yards. He set the single-game completion record for the second straight week and is now the new single-game record holder for passing yards in a game, previously set in 2019. He also now holds the new single-season record for completions (previously 291, he now sits at 326), and went over 3,000 yards, the fourth such instance in a season (3,458, now third in history). For the first time in school history, FAU had three receivers with 100 or more yards in a game. Henry (7 catches for 157 yards – both career highs and his first 100-yard game), Messer (11 for 119) and redshirt sophomore Asaad Wassem (12 for 109 – like Henry, new career best and also his first 100-yard game) all went over the century mark. Veltkamp and Henry's 90-yard connection is the third-longest pass in school history. Messer is the first non-QB in FAU history to have a passing, rushing and receiving touchdown in the same season. Shields-Dutton led the backs with 77 yards on 14 carries, followed by redshirt sophomore Gemari Sands' 44 yards on 11 totes. DEFENSE Leading the way in tackles was junior LB Leon Hart Jr. with nine stops. He now has 101 tackles in his career. Just behind him with seven apiece were two DBs, redshirt senior Terez Reid and redshirt junior Jayden Sweeney. Freshman DE Josh Roberts had a solo sack, and splitting the other was redshirt senior DT Bryce Langston and redshirt senior DL Naejaun Barber.

    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – The Florida Atlantic women's basketball team battled closely with Florida but were unable to hold on through the end of the game, dropping the contest 59-51 inside Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena. The Owls fall to 2-3 while Florida improves to 6-1 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED The Owls had a slow start to the first quarter, with their first points coming from Destyne Jackson three minutes in. This was followed up by a Vivian Onugha layup to make the score 6-4 with 4:12 to go. Florida went on a 6-0 run before a Jess Moors jumper closed out the quarter, with FAU trailing by six, 14-8. The Gators started to pull away at the start of the second, putting the Owls down by 10. Jackson brought FAU back within five points and started a 9-0 run for the Owls, allowing them to bring the score to 18-17. Florida Atlantic got its first lead of the game from a Michiyah Simmons 3-pointer with three minutes to go in the quarter, 20-19.

The Gators pushed their lead back to 11 with 33 seconds to play, but a late rally just wasn't enough to close the gap, as Florida took the 59-51 contest. HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND \"Really excited about the effort tonight against Florida. They are a very good team, and I thought we fought extremely hard for 40 minutes. There are a lot of things that we continue to improve, and I thought we improved a lot of those things today. We are about growth right now, so every game and every practice is instrumental for us to continue to make those moves.\" NOTES AND TEAM STATS Jackson led the team in scoring with 10 points on the night.

    "content": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Florida Atlantic's men's basketball team is heading to the Sunshine Slam's championship game after defeating Loyola Marymount by a score of 64-52 on Monday night at the Ocean Center. The Owls (5-1) delivered the Lions' (6-1) their first loss of the season in the tournament's semifinal matchup behind junior guard Kanaan Carlyle's second consecutive 20-point outing and redshirt sophomore Devin Vanterpool with another all-around performance highlighted by his 14 points and a relentless defensive effort. FIRST HALF The Owls jumped out to an early lead with Carlyle, whose momentum carried over from the previous game, with a four-point play three minutes in. FAU's lead grew to as much as 13 before LMU went on a run to close the gap to four. An offensive drought was ended by a ferocious driving dunk from Xander Pintelon, part of a perfect first half from the field for the junior forward. The hot shooting start continued up to the final buzzer, with Vanterpool drilling an attempt from beyond the arc in the closing seconds to send the Owls into the locker room with a 41-34 lead. SECOND HALF LMU worked its way back into the game, cutting the deficit to four in the opening minutes of the final period. The Owls never surrendered the lead, responding with a 12-2 run over the course of four minutes to go up by 11. The Lions had one more run in them to trail by two with just under 10 minutes remaining, but Florida Atlantic soon built its lead back up to double digits, this time from attacking the paint. An explosive sequence by Vanterpool on both ends of the floor ensued, soaring for a two-handed block to deny a dunk attempt despite a four-inch height disadvantage, and then swishing a step-back jumper. It was all FAU the rest of the way, surrendering just two field goals to the Lions in the final five minutes. PRESS CONFERENCE GALLERY Gallery: (11-24-2025) MBB vs. LMU STATS & NOTES For the third time in four seasons, Florida Atlantic has won four out of its first five games. The Owls have not trailed at any point in their last four victories. With 24 points, Carlyle reached a new FAU career high for the second straight game. Redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams, the team's leader in blocks, totaled three in the first half and finished the night with a career high of four. Pintelon hauled in nine rebounds, the most by an Owl on the season. The team won the rebounding battle over the Lions 42-29.

    "content": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – The Florida Atlantic men's basketball team erased a 19-point second half deficit but ultimately fell to George Mason, 74-65, in the Sunshine Slam championship game on Tuesday evening at the Ocean Center. In the title game for the 2025 Sunshine Slam's Beach Bracket, the Owls (5-2) embarked on a 12-0 run over the Patriots (7-0) with less than 11 minutes remaining, bringing the game within one possession multiple times in the final moments. Redshirt sophomore guard Devin Vanterpool was once again an FAU spark plug, scoring 17 points on 6-for-9 shooting to go with his team-best nine rebounds and five assists to earn a spot on the Sunshine Slam's All-Tournament team. FIRST HALF The Owls' early offensive success came from three-point range, with the first nine points coming from beyond the arc. Junior guard Kanaan Carlyle and Devin Vanterpool combined for 21 of the team's 25 points. Florida Atlantic closed the gap on the double-digit deficit, trailing by nine with one minute remaining, before two straight triples from George Mason sent the Owls into the locker room trailing 40-25. SECOND HALF Leaning on the inside game to start the final period, the Owls converted seven of their first 11 attempts, all coming from the paint. With under 11 minutes remaining, the Patriots took a game-high 19-point lead. Then, the Florida Atlantic comeback was on, going on its 12-0 run while holding George Mason without a field goal for nearly five minutes. The Owls' gap continued to close, led by Vanterpool and redshirt freshman guard Amar Amkou, who checked in for the first time of the night with 12 minutes to go and scored seven points. Vanterpool attacked the rim and converted a three-point play to bring the game within single digits, followed by an Amkou layup off a George Mason turnover to cut the lead to three points at the two-minute mark. Redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams tipped in a missed shot to put the game within one possession once again with 38 seconds left, but the Patriots converted six free throws down the stretch to end the valiant comeback effort. PRESS CONFERENCE STATS & NOTES Carlyle led the way in scoring with 22 points, the first Owl to record 20+ in three straight games since Vlad Goldin in 2024.

    "headline": "Game Notes Week #12",
    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Florida Atlantic football will conclude its 2025 season with a matchup against East Carolina at Flagler Credit Union Stadium. The 12 p.m. kickoff is scheduled to air on ESPN+ and on FoxSports 640 South Florida. The Owls (4-7, 3-4) will look to conclude a historic offensive season where they stand as the top passing offense in the nation at 3,783 yards. The team can surpass its single-season record with 174 more on Saturday. Redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp leads Division I in passing completions with 326 while redshirt junior WR Easton Messer is number one in receptions per game at 8.55. Veltkamp, who has etched his name all over the FAU record books in one season, is seeking 117 yards to overtake the top spot in the program's single-season total offense yards record. He needs two passing touchdowns for sole possession of third place in the single-season record, and could tie for second with a four-TD performance. Messer currently stands at number two in program history for single-season receptions with 94. The current record is 108. He is 22 yards away from entering the top five for receiving yards in a season by an Owl, and 206 away from the team record. Records that have fallen in the last few weeks include the single-game pass completions mark (Veltkamp set it twice in a row with 39 followed by 42) and passing yards (494).

    "headline": "Owls’ Comeback Comes Up Short in Sunshine Slam Title Game",
    "content": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – The Florida Atlantic men's basketball team erased a 19-point second half deficit but ultimately fell to George Mason, 74-65, in the Sunshine Slam championship game on Tuesday evening at the Ocean Center. In the title game for the 2025 Sunshine Slam's Beach Bracket, the Owls (5-2) embarked on a 12-0 run over the Patriots (7-0) with less than 11 minutes remaining, bringing the game within one possession multiple times in the final moments. Redshirt sophomore guard Devin Vanterpool was once again an FAU spark plug, scoring 17 points on 6-for-9 shooting to go with his team-best nine rebounds and five assists to earn a spot on the Sunshine Slam's All-Tournament team. FIRST HALF The Owls' early offensive success came from three-point range, with the first nine points coming from beyond the arc. Junior guard Kanaan Carlyle and Devin Vanterpool combined for 21 of the team's 25 points. Florida Atlantic closed the gap on the double-digit deficit, trailing by nine with one minute remaining, before two straight triples from George Mason sent the Owls into the locker room trailing 40-25. SECOND HALF Leaning on the inside game to start the final period, the Owls converted seven of their first 11 attempts, all coming from the paint. With under 11 minutes remaining, the Patriots took a game-high 19-point lead. Then, the Florida Atlantic comeback was on, going on its 12-0 run while holding George Mason without a field goal for nearly five minutes. The Owls' gap continued to close, led by Vanterpool and redshirt freshman guard Amar Amkou, who checked in for the first time of the night with 12 minutes to go and scored seven points. Vanterpool attacked the rim and converted a three-point play to bring the game within single digits, followed by an Amkou layup off a George Mason turnover to cut the lead to three points at the two-minute mark. Redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams tipped in a missed shot to put the game within one possession once again with 38 seconds left, but the Patriots converted six free throws down the stretch to end the valiant comeback effort. PRESS CONFERENCE STATS & NOTES Carlyle led the way in scoring with 22 points, the first Owl to record 20+ in three straight games since Vlad Goldin in 2024. Vanterpool's nine rebounds are a new career high. He has recorded at least five in each of the first seven games. With three on the night, Williams had his fourth consecutive game with at least three blocks. He has recorded multiple in six out of seven games on the season. The Owls outscored the Patriots 38-26 in the paint. UP NEXT Florida Atlantic will close out the month of November by hosting St. Bonaventure on the 30th at 3:30 p.m. at Eleanor R.
