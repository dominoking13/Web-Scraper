HOW IT HAPPENED Tulane took the opening lead, holding a 15-11 advantage through the first set media break.

    "headline": "Owls Take Homecoming Game Versus Tulsa",
    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Behind three touchdowns from Easton Messer and three takeaways from the defense, the Florida Atlantic football team defeated Tulsa in Saturday afternoon's Homecoming game at Flagler Credit Union Stadium by a score of 40-21. The Owls (4-5, 3-3) dropped 40 points at home for the third time this season with a complete game on both sides of the ball against the Golden Hurricane (2-7, 0-6), winning the turnover margin battle 3-1. VIDEO RECAP THE BEGINNING Starting out on defense, redshirt senior DB Terez Reid picked off a pass on the fourth play of the game, the Owls' first interception of the year. FAU's first drive on offense culminated in a 39-yard field goal by Garrison Smith, extending its program record to six consecutive games with a score on the opening possession. After a goal-line stand on defense, redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp continued his growing connection with redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt, hitting him down the sideline where Platt took it 47 yards for a touchdown and a 10-0 lead. THE TURNING POINT Following two Tulsa field goals early in the second, Veltkamp found a wide-open Messer for a 44-yard score to up the score to 17-6, the first of 21 unanswered points to close the half. It was then redshirt senior DB Damarius McGhee's turn to make a game-changing play, scooping up a fumble at the goal line and returning it 95 yards for the score. With the defense back on the field, senior DB Chris Keys Jr. made an interception to give it right back to the Owls, setting up the second score to Messer on an 11-yard strike to send FAU to the locker room up 31-6. THE FINISH After a quiet third quarter, a drive commanded by graduate QB Zach Gibson gave the Owls 40. A 30-yard grab from Platt on 4th-and-one flea flicker set up Messer's nine-yard score, his third of the day. Two sacks – one by junior DE Deshaun Batiste and the other by freshman DE Josh Roberts – kept Tulsa out of the end zone the rest of the way. OFFENSE Messer's hat trick was the first multi-score game of his collegiate career. He becomes just the sixth receiver in program history to haul in three touchdown catches in a single game. For the second week in a row, Platt recorded a 100+ yard receiving game with 114 on five catches. Sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton logged the first 100+ yard game of his career, with 107 yards on just 11 carries. He ripped off a 50-yard run, the longest of his career, to end the first quarter. DEFENSE McGhee's 95-yard fumble return is the second longest in program history, yardage not seen since the second game in the 2001 inaugural season. Leading the way in tackles was redshirt junior Leon Hart Jr. with 12. Redshirt junior LB Tyler Stolsky recorded 11 tackles, his fourth straight game in double digits. In addition to the three takeaways, the Owls' defensive unit forced three turnovers-on-downs, and recorded five sacks, eight tackles for loss and six pass breakups POSTGAME AUDIO Hagerty Family Head Football Coach Zach Kittley Redshirt Junior QB Caden Veltkamp Graduate QB Zach Gibson Redshirt Junior WR Easton Messer Redshirt Junior WR Jayshon Platt Graduate OL Alex Atcavage Redshirt Senior DB Terez Reid Redshirt Senior DB Damarius McGhee PHOTO GALLERY Gallery: (11-8-2025) Tulsa at Florida Atlantic UP NEXT The Owls will travel for their final road game of the 2025 season, heading to New Orleans for a matchup with Tulane on Saturday, Nov. 15.

The two teams will meet for the third time, second as American Conference members. The two first met back in Boca Raton in 2013 with the Owls coming away with a 34-17 win. The Owls then fell to a No. 24 Tulane, 24-8, also in Paradise, in 2023. NOTABLE Starting Fast - Hagerty Family Football Head Coach Zach Kittley's Air Raid offense is aggressive early and often, which has paid off tremendously. The Owls have scored on their opening possession in six consecutive games, never done before in program history. Since the month of October began, the offense converted 20 out of 23 (87%) fourth down attempts. Hat Tricks - Redshirt junior wide receiver Easton Messer had the first multi-touchdown game of his career in the 40-21, hauling in three scores. He is the second Owl to record a hat trick game of TDs, joining sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton who scored three on the ground versus UAB. This marks the first time since 2019 in which both a runner and a receiver have had a three-touchdown game for the Owls in one season. All-Around Platt - Redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt has recorded back-to-back 100+ yard games, now up to 585 receiving on the season. He also contributes to the Owls via kick return (498 yards) and rushing (12 yards per-carry, one touchdown). His 124.3 all-purpose yards per game ranks 10th nationwide. Elite Company - Redshirt junior LB Tyler Stolsky has racked up tackles at a high rate, notching 12+ in four straight games. The last Owl to do so was Azeez Al-Shaair back in 2017. Stolsky holds the team lead at 72 through nine games. 100 Back-to-Back - Platt is the second wideout this season to have 100+ receiving yards in consecutive games, versus Navy and Tulsa. He joins Messer, who had 100+ against Memphis and Rice. They are the first duo in program history to have two consecutive games reaching the century mark in receiving yards. Strong Last Third - The Owls will face Tulane, UConn and ECU to close the 2025 regular season. The trio is a combined 20-8 on the year.

    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Damarius McGhee and Easton Messer received Honorable Mention honors for their efforts in Florida Atlantic football's 40-21 victory over Tulsa last Saturday, announced the American Conference on Monday. McGhee, a redshirt senior CB from Pensacola, Florida, gathered a fumble forced by teammate Zyere Hortorn at the one-yard line and scampered 95 untouched yards for the second longest scoop and score in program history. The longest was 99 yards in the program's second game and first win back on September 8, 2001, 297 games between the two occurrences. McGhee was the first defensive score for the 2025 Owls and it put FAU up 17-6 with 58 seconds remaining in the first half. On the night, McGhee recorded five solo tackles, which was fourth on the team, and added a pass breakup. Messer, a WR from Louisville, Kentucky, completed his first career multi-TD game with three versus Tulsa. The redshirt junior etched himself in the FAU record book as the sixth player in program history to record three in one game. The slot receiver, who is No. 2 nationally with 8.22 catches per game, collected six passes last Saturday for a total of 83 yards, 34 coming after the catch. His longest of the game was a 44-yard TD reception that put the Owls up 10-6 over Tulsa with 5:21 remaining in the first. An 11-yard collection with 14 seconds remaining in the first half gave FAU a 24-6 lead heading into the break and he iced the game with a nine-yard reception thrown by Zach Gibson.
