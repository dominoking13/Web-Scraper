    "content": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Florida Atlantic's men's basketball team is heading to the Sunshine Slam's championship game after defeating Loyola Marymount by a score of 64-52 on Monday night at the Ocean Center. The Owls (5-1) delivered the Lions' (6-1) their first loss of the season in the tournament's semifinal matchup behind junior guard Kanaan Carlyle's second consecutive 20-point outing and redshirt sophomore Devin Vanterpool with another all-around performance highlighted by his 14 points and a relentless defensive effort. FIRST HALF The Owls jumped out to an early lead with Carlyle, whose momentum carried over from the previous game, with a four-point play three minutes in. FAU's lead grew to as much as 13 before LMU went on a run to close the gap to four. An offensive drought was ended by a ferocious driving dunk from Xander Pintelon, part of a perfect first half from the field for the junior forward. The hot shooting start continued up to the final buzzer, with Vanterpool drilling an attempt from beyond the arc in the closing seconds to send the Owls into the locker room with a 41-34 lead. SECOND HALF LMU worked its way back into the game, cutting the deficit to four in the opening minutes of the final period. The Owls never surrendered the lead, responding with a 12-2 run over the course of four minutes to go up by 11. The Lions had one more run in them to trail by two with just under 10 minutes remaining, but Florida Atlantic soon built its lead back up to double digits, this time from attacking the paint. An explosive sequence by Vanterpool on both ends of the floor ensued, soaring for a two-handed block to deny a dunk attempt despite a four-inch height disadvantage, and then swishing a step-back jumper. It was all FAU the rest of the way, surrendering just two field goals to the Lions in the final five minutes. PRESS CONFERENCE GALLERY Gallery: (11-24-2025) MBB vs. LMU STATS & NOTES For the third time in four seasons, Florida Atlantic has won four out of its first five games. The Owls have not trailed at any point in their last four victories. With 24 points, Carlyle reached a new FAU career high for the second straight game. Redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams, the team's leader in blocks, totaled three in the first half and finished the night with a career high of four. Pintelon hauled in nine rebounds, the most by an Owl on the season. The team won the rebounding battle over the Lions 42-29.

FIRST HALF The Owls' early offensive success came from three-point range, with the first nine points coming from beyond the arc.

The Owls improve to 3-3 overall, and Air Force falls to 3-4 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED Air Force opened the contest on an 8-4 run, but the Owls answered back with an 8-4 run of their own, capped off by Vivian Onugha's first basket of the day, to tie things up at 12-12 with just under three minutes remaining in the first. FAU took the lead at 17-14, but an Air Force triple tied the back-and-forth contest at 17-all to close the first. The Falcons retook the lead to open the second, 21-17. Destyne Jackson brought the Owls back within two at 21-17 at the 7:40-minute mark. Air Force capitalized on numerous FAU errors as the Falcons went on a 13-4 run to hold a 13-point lead with 2:37 to go in the half.

The Owls maintained their advantage, but a late Air Force triple closed out the 76-71 contest in favor of the Owls. HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND \"I felt like we fought really hard to get back in the game. We started out extremely flat, which I believe is due to the physicality of the game on Monday, so we had to get refocused at half. Our full-court pressure definitely got us back in the game and enabled us to force the turnovers we needed to score some easy buckets. NOTES AND TEAM STATS Three Owls finished in double figures in the win. Moors led the way for the Owls with a team-high 15 points, shooting 57 percent (4-of-7) from the field, 50 percent (1-of-2) from 3-point range, and going a perfect 100 percent (6-of-6) at the line.

Wright State had the final possession, but Moors intercepted the inbound pass to close out the final seconds and seal the Owls' 66-65 win. HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND I'm really proud of our effort today. It was a complete team win. I thought we fought for 45 minutes. Even though it wasn't pretty offensively, I thought we had a great defensive effort and followed the game plan extremely well. We had some big plays down the stretch, Jess Moors' layup in transition to put us into overtime, and then her steal late came up huge. Also, Michiyah Simmons, I thought she had some big plays offensively to keep us in the game. But overall, a great team win, and really proud of this team for continuing to fight and never giving in.\" NOTES AND TEAM STATS Three Owls finished in double digits on the day. Destyne Jackson and Simmons each had a team-high 12 points.

    "headline": "Second-Half Surge Powers Owls Past Air Force",
    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – A big second-half surge helped to lead the Florida Atlantic Owls past the Air Force Falcons, 76-71, on Thursday at Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena. The Owls improve to 3-3 overall, and Air Force falls to 3-4 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED Air Force opened the contest on an 8-4 run, but the Owls answered back with an 8-4 run of their own, capped off by Vivian Onugha's first basket of the day, to tie things up at 12-12 with just under three minutes remaining in the first. FAU took the lead at 17-14, but an Air Force triple tied the back-and-forth contest at 17-all to close the first. The Falcons retook the lead to open the second, 21-17. Destyne Jackson brought the Owls back within two at 21-17 at the 7:40-minute mark. Air Force capitalized on numerous FAU errors as the Falcons went on a 13-4 run to hold a 13-point lead with 2:37 to go in the half.

Capitalizing on numerous Air Force turnovers, FAU produced a dominant 19-7 run, capped off by a triple from Madi Gewirtz, to retake the lead 45-43.

The Owls maintained their advantage, but a late Air Force triple closed out the 76-71 contest in favor of the Owls. HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND \"I felt like we fought really hard to get back in the game. We started out extremely flat, which I believe is due to the physicality of the game on Monday, so we had to get refocused at half. Our full-court pressure definitely got us back in the game and enabled us to force the turnovers we needed to score some easy buckets. NOTES AND TEAM STATS Three Owls finished in double figures in the win. Moors led the way for the Owls with a team-high 15 points, shooting 57 percent (4-of-7) from the field, 50 percent (1-of-2) from 3-point range, and going a perfect 100 percent (6-of-6) at the line. Moors also dished out a team-best three assists and collected three steals and a board in the win. Jackson and Onugha rounded out the Owls' double-figure scorers, tallying 14 points apiece. Onugha finished with a team-leading seven boards and added a block in the contest. The Owls had a strong second-half performance, outscoring the Falcons 40-35 in the final two periods.
