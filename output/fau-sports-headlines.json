The Owls fall to 17-9 on the season and 8-5 in American play, while Tulane moves to 11-13 overall and 3-10 in conference play. HOW IT HAPPENED Tulane took the opening lead, holding a 15-11 advantage through the first set media break. The Owls battled back to within three, cutting the deficit to 18-15 after a kill from Kierstin Bevelle, but FAU couldn't close out the rally as the Green Wave captured the set on a 7-2 run to take the opening set 25-17. The Owls opened the second set strong, taking the opening lead at 4-1 Tulane answered back, cutting the Owls' lead to one at 7-6, however, Kayla Richardson helped spark a 4-0 Owl run with a kill and a block assist, along with a pair of Green Wave attacking errors to extend FAU's lead back to five, 11-6, pushing the Green Wave to call their first timeout of the set. Tulane cut the deficit in half shortly after, forcing the Owls to call a timeout of their own, holding a 13-11 lead. The Green Wave battled, eventually bringing the set even at 19-19.

However, following an FAU timeout, the Owls locked in to outscore the Green Wave 11-3 and take a five-point advantage at 16-11.

    "headline": "Owls Take Homecoming Game Versus Tulsa",
    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Behind three touchdowns from Easton Messer and three takeaways from the defense, the Florida Atlantic football team defeated Tulsa in Saturday afternoon's Homecoming game at Flagler Credit Union Stadium by a score of 40-21. The Owls (4-5, 3-3) dropped 40 points at home for the third time this season with a complete game on both sides of the ball against the Golden Hurricane (2-7, 0-6), winning the turnover margin battle 3-1. VIDEO RECAP THE BEGINNING Starting out on defense, redshirt senior DB Terez Reid picked off a pass on the second play of the game, the Owls' first interception of the year. FAU's first drive on offense culminated in a 39-yard field goal by Garrison Smith, extending its program record to six consecutive games with a score on the opening possession. After a goal-line stand on defense, redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp continued his growing connection with redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt, hitting him down the sideline where Platt took it 47 yards for a touchdown and a 10-0 lead. THE TURNING POINT Following two Tulsa field goals early in the second, Veltkamp found a wide-open Messer for a 44-yard score to up the score to 17-6, the first of 21 unanswered points to close the half. It was then redshirt senior DB Damarius McGhee's turn to make a game-changing play, scooping up a fumble at the goal line and returning it 95 yards for the score. With the defense back on the field, senior DB Chris Keys Jr. made an interception to give it right back to the Owls, setting up the second score to Messer on an 11-yard strike to send FAU to the locker room up 31-6. THE FINISH After a quiet third quarter, a drive commanded by graduate QB Zach Gibson gave the Owls 40. A 30-yard grab from Platt on 4th-and-one flea flicker set up Messer's nine-yard score, his third of the day. Two sacks – one by junior DE Deshaun Batiste and the other by freshman DE Josh Roberts – kept Tulsa out of the end zone the rest of the way. OFFENSE Messer's hat trick was the first multi-score game of his collegiate career. He becomes just the sixth receiver in program history to haul in three touchdown catches in a single game. For the second week in a row, Platt recorded a 100+ yard receiving game with 114 on five catches. Sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton logged the first 100+ yard game of his career, with 107 yards on just 11 carries. He ripped off a 50-yard run, the longest of his career, to end the first quarter. DEFENSE McGhee's 95-yard fumble return is the second longest in program history, yardage not seen since the second game in the 2001 inaugural season. Leading the way in tackles was redshirt junior Leon Hart Jr. with 12. Redshirt junior LB Tyler Stolsky recorded 11 tackles, his fourth straight game in double digits. In addition to the three takeaways, the Owls' defensive unit forced three turnovers-on-downs, and recorded five sacks, eight tackles for loss and six pass breakups POSTGAME AUDIO Hagerty Family Head Football Coach Zach Kittley Redshirt Junior QB Caden Veltkamp Graduate QB Zach Gibson Redshirt Junior WR Easton Messer Redshirt Junior WR Jayshon Platt Graduate OL Alex Atcavage Redshirt Senior DB Terez Reid Redshirt Senior DB Damarius McGhee PHOTO GALLERY Gallery: (11-8-2025) Tulsa at Florida Atlantic UP NEXT The Owls will travel for their final road game of the 2025 season, heading to New Orleans for a matchup with Tulane on Saturday, Nov. 15.
