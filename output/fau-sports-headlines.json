    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Florida Atlantic volleyball closed out regular season play on Friday, earning a straight-set sweep against the UTSA Roadrunners, 3-0 (26-24, 25-21, 25-21), on Senior Night inside Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena. The Owls close out the regular season at 19-10 and 10-6 in American play, while UTSA falls to 13-13 overall and 6-9 in conference play. HOW IT HAPPENED UTSA took the early advantage, leading 5-2, but a 4-0 FAU run gave the Owls their first lead of the match after a kill from Anna Hartman, 6-5. After a 10-10 tie, the Roadrunners retook the lead, holding a two-point advantage, 15-13, through the opening media break. UTSA extended its lead to 19-16, forcing the Owls to call their first timeout of the match, but following the break, the Owls scored three unanswered off a pair of Roadrunner errors and an ace from Erin Morrissey to tie the set at 19-19 and spark a UTSA timeout. The Roadrunners held set point at 24-22, but two kills from Hartman and one from Morrissey powered a set-ending 4-0 run as the Owls took the opening set, 26-24. The Owls fell into a hole early in the second, trailing 12-5 to open the set. Florida Atlantic battled back, outscoring the Roadrunners 10-3 to fight back and tie things up at 15-15 after a kill from Maggie Allred, sparking UTSA to call a timeout. The two squads battled back and forth through a tight 22-21 FAU lead, but the Owls recorded back-to-back kills from Libby Ashline, Olivia Hart, and Kayla Richardson to secure the second set, 25-21, and give FAU the two-set lead. Unlike the first two sets, Florida Atlantic came out firing in the third, opening the period on a 13-6 run. The Roadrunners battled back to cut the Owls' lead to three at 14-11, but FAU responded on a 4-1 run to extend its lead back to six, 18-12, and spark the Roadrunners to call a timeout. UTSA attempted to rally, battling back within two at 19-17 and 23-21, but the Owls capitalized on a pair of Roadrunner errors to close out the third, 25-21, and secure the straight-set sweep. STATS & NOTES Hartman led the way offensively for the Owls with a team-high 11 kills in the match. Emsley Venard finished with a team-best 21 assists.

    "headline": "Owls Come Up Short Against Green Wave",
    "content": "NEW ORLEANS – In its final road contest of the 2025 regular season, the Florida Atlantic football team fell to American Conference contender Tulane by a score of 35-24 on Saturday afternoon. The Owls (4-6, 3-4) were led by redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp, who set the individual single game program record in both completions (39) and attempts (57) while throwing for a season best 375 yards. He was assisted in the passing game by career best outings from redshirt junior WR Easton Messer (133 yards) and redshirt sophomore WR Asaad Waseem (11 receptions). VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF Florida Atlantic's offense marched right into Green Wave (8-2, 5-1) territory on the opening drive, halted by an interception in the end zone. The defense forced consecutive three-and-outs before Tulane capitalized on a fumbled punt return and scored on the next play. The Owls put points on the board on the following possession, set up by Veltkamp finding Messer on a first-and-23 who turned a pass short of the sticks into a 50-yard gain. The drive led to a field goal from redshirt senior K Garrison Smith. After another Tulane touchdown to close the first quarter, Florida Atlantic responded with a 75-yard drive culminating in Veltkamp finding redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt on fourth-and-goal for his third straight game with a receiving touchdown to narrow the gap to 14-10. The Green Wave scored once more to send the Owls to the locker room trailing 21-10. SECOND HALF FAU's defense stopped Tulane on two consecutive drives, first forcing a punt at midfield and then an interception by freshman DE Josh Roberts, before a touchdown late in third quarter extended the Green Wave lead to three scores. Not going down without a fight, Florida Atlantic put together another 75-yard scoring drive finishing with a score by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton from one yard out to cut the deficit to 28-16. While Tulane found the end zone one more time with under five minutes to go, the Owls had one more drive left in them. Veltkamp connected with Messer for an 11-yard touchdown and Waseem for the ensuing two-point conversion. The onside kick came up short, leaving the 35-24 final. OFFENSE Veltkamp has thrown for 300+ passing yards in four games, most by an Owl quarterback in a single season since Chris Robison in 2019. Through 10 games in 2025, he is now eight completions away from setting the program's single-season record. Messer had his third 100+ yard game of the season, reaching 117 in the first half alone. He has hauled in 83 catches in 2025, now second all-time in program history for a single season. Platt is the first Florida Atlantic player to log a receiving touchdown in three straight games since LaJohntay Wester in 2022. Redshirt junior WR Dominique Henry recorded career highs in both receptions (six) and yards (78). DEFENSE Leading in tackles with a double-digit performance for the second week in a row was redshirt junior LB Leon Hart Jr. with 13, also notching 1.5 tackles for loss. Roberts' interception was the Owls' third of the season. Junior DE Deshaun Batiste and redshirt junior CJ Doggette Jr. joined forces for a sack.

The victory is the program's second conference championship all-time and first since the 2007 Atlantic Soccer Championship. The start of Saturday's Championship Final was ominous for the Owls. FIU scored the opening goal just three minutes in after a mad scramble inside the six-yard box. In the midst of it, goalkeeper Alfred Mikkelsen took a kick to the face. The officials went to video review but ultimately upheld the call on the field, ruling it no foul. The FAU offense responded to tie the game in the 20th minute. Josh Ainge played a through ball to Mamadou Diarra. The two-time American Conference Offensive Player of the Year cut inside and connected on a thunderous strike past the FIU keeper. Four minutes later, the Owls grabbed the lead for the first time, and they would not relinquish it. Ethan Schumaker headed home a corner kick from Aboubacar Traore to send Florida Atlantic into halftime with a 2-1 lead. Diarra scored his second of the night in the 70th minute to double the lead. This time, it was Felipe Santos who played the striker into a dangerous area. Diarra found just enough space to fire off a left-footed strike from just outside the penalty area. The Owls led 3-1 with 20 minutes to go. FIU scored in the 80th minute, but the Panthers would get no closer. The Owls held on for a thrilling 3-2 victory. Diarra was named Offensive Player of the Tournament. Center back Fabrizio Cubeddu earned the Defensive Player of the Tournament award.

This time, it was Felipe Santos who played the striker into a dangerous area. Diarra found just enough space to fire off a left-footed strike from just outside the penalty area. The Owls led 3-1 with 20 minutes to go. FIU scored in the 80th minute, but the Panthers would get no closer. The Owls held on for a thrilling 3-2 victory. Diarra was named Offensive Player of the Tournament. Center back Fabrizio Cubeddu earned the Defensive Player of the Tournament award.

    "content": "NEW ORLEANS – In its final road contest of the 2025 regular season, the Florida Atlantic football team fell to American Conference contender Tulane by a score of 35-24 on Saturday afternoon. The Owls (4-6, 3-4) were led by redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp, who set the individual single game program record in both completions (39) and attempts (57) while throwing for a season best 375 yards. He was assisted in the passing game by career best outings from redshirt junior WR Easton Messer (133 yards) and redshirt sophomore WR Asaad Waseem (11 receptions). VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF Florida Atlantic's offense marched right into Green Wave (8-2, 5-1) territory on the opening drive, halted by an interception in the end zone. The defense forced consecutive three-and-outs before Tulane capitalized on a fumbled punt return and scored on the next play. The Owls put points on the board on the following possession, set up by Veltkamp finding Messer on a first-and-23 who turned a pass short of the sticks into a 50-yard gain. The drive led to a field goal from redshirt senior K Garrison Smith. After another Tulane touchdown to close the first quarter, Florida Atlantic responded with a 75-yard drive culminating in Veltkamp finding redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt on fourth-and-goal for his third straight game with a receiving touchdown to narrow the gap to 14-10. The Green Wave scored once more to send the Owls to the locker room trailing 21-10. SECOND HALF FAU's defense stopped Tulane on two consecutive drives, first forcing a punt at midfield and then an interception by freshman DE Josh Roberts, before a touchdown late in third quarter extended the Green Wave lead to three scores. Not going down without a fight, Florida Atlantic put together another 75-yard scoring drive finishing with a score by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton from one yard out to cut the deficit to 28-16. While Tulane found the end zone one more time with under five minutes to go, the Owls had one more drive left in them. Veltkamp connected with Messer for an 11-yard touchdown and Waseem for the ensuing two-point conversion. The onside kick came up short, leaving the 35-24 final. OFFENSE Veltkamp has thrown for 300+ passing yards in four games, most by an Owl quarterback in a single season since Chris Robison in 2019. Through 10 games in 2025, he is now eight completions away from setting the program's single-season record. Messer had his third 100+ yard game of the season, reaching 117 in the first half alone. He has hauled in 83 catches in 2025, now second all-time in program history for a single season. Platt is the first Florida Atlantic player to log a receiving touchdown in three straight games since LaJohntay Wester in 2022. Redshirt junior WR Dominique Henry recorded career highs in both receptions (six) and yards (78). DEFENSE Leading in tackles with a double-digit performance for the second week in a row was redshirt junior LB Leon Hart Jr. with 13, also notching 1.5 tackles for loss. Roberts' interception was the Owls' third of the season. Junior DE Deshaun Batiste and redshirt junior CJ Doggette Jr. joined forces for a sack.
