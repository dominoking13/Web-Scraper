HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND \"I thought we competed really well, but unfortunately, we didn't have our legs under us. The physicality of Miami's team kind of wore us down early. We had some open looks that typically fall for us, and they just weren't falling, and against a team like Miami, you really need those shots to fall. Proud of our effort, and I know we can learn a lot from this game.\" NOTES AND TEAM STATS Carstensen led the Owls with a team-high 14 points on the night. Gewirtz led the team on the glass with four boards. Moors had a team-leading three assists. The Owls led the Hurricanes at the line with 58 percent to 50 percent. Florida Atlantic led Miami in steals, 10-6.

Baldwin Arena. The Owls close out the regular season at 19-10 and 10-6 in American play, while UTSA falls to 13-13 overall and 6-9 in conference play. HOW IT HAPPENED UTSA took the early advantage, leading 5-2, but a 4-0 FAU run gave the Owls their first lead of the match after a kill from Anna Hartman, 6-5.

    "content": "NEW ORLEANS – In its final road contest of the 2025 regular season, the Florida Atlantic football team fell to American Conference contender Tulane by a score of 35-24 on Saturday afternoon. The Owls (4-6, 3-4) were led by redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp, who set the individual single game program record in both completions (39) and attempts (57) while throwing for a season best 375 yards. He was assisted in the passing game by career best outings from redshirt junior WR Easton Messer (133 yards) and redshirt sophomore WR Asaad Waseem (11 receptions). VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF Florida Atlantic's offense marched right into Green Wave (8-2, 5-1) territory on the opening drive, halted by an interception in the end zone. The defense forced consecutive three-and-outs before Tulane capitalized on a fumbled punt return and scored on the next play. The Owls put points on the board on the following possession, set up by Veltkamp finding Messer on a first-and-23 who turned a pass short of the sticks into a 50-yard gain. The drive led to a field goal from redshirt senior K Garrison Smith. After another Tulane touchdown to close the first quarter, Florida Atlantic responded with a 75-yard drive culminating in Veltkamp finding redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt on fourth-and-goal for his third straight game with a receiving touchdown to narrow the gap to 14-10. The Green Wave scored once more to send the Owls to the locker room trailing 21-10. SECOND HALF FAU's defense stopped Tulane on two consecutive drives, first forcing a punt at midfield and then an interception by freshman DE Josh Roberts, before a touchdown late in third quarter extended the Green Wave lead to three scores. Not going down without a fight, Florida Atlantic put together another 75-yard scoring drive finishing with a score by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton from one yard out to cut the deficit to 28-16. While Tulane found the end zone one more time with under five minutes to go, the Owls had one more drive left in them. Veltkamp connected with Messer for an 11-yard touchdown and Waseem for the ensuing two-point conversion. The onside kick came up short, leaving the 35-24 final. OFFENSE Veltkamp has thrown for 300+ passing yards in four games, most by an Owl quarterback in a single season since Chris Robison in 2019. Through 10 games in 2025, he is now eight completions away from setting the program's single-season record. Messer had his third 100+ yard game of the season, reaching 117 in the first half alone. He has hauled in 83 catches in 2025, now second all-time in program history for a single season. Platt is the first Florida Atlantic player to log a receiving touchdown in three straight games since LaJohntay Wester in 2022. Redshirt junior WR Dominique Henry recorded career highs in both receptions (six) and yards (78). DEFENSE Leading in tackles with a double-digit performance for the second week in a row was redshirt junior LB Leon Hart Jr. with 13, also notching 1.5 tackles for loss. Roberts' interception was the Owls' third of the season. Junior DE Deshaun Batiste and redshirt junior CJ Doggette Jr. joined forces for a sack.

    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Florida Atlantic women's basketball Head Coach LeAnn Freeland announced another big addition to the Owls' 2026 class with the signing of guard Jaelynn Housey on Friday. \"Jaelynn Housey was the first player we identified as a priority when we took over the program in April,\" said Head Coach LeAnn Freeland. \"Being a high-profile Florida player, our whole staff was aware of her abilities. Our goal is to keep the best Florida players at home, and Jaelynn is a great start. She's a big guard who can play multiple positions in our system. Her size, versatility, and skill set will pose matchup problems for smaller guards and bigger posts on both ends of the floor. She's a true winner and leader who has competed at a high level with Coach Hively at Nova High School and the Miami Suns AAU organization. Our coaching staff and players are excited that Jaelynn Housey is an Owl!\" Housey, a south Florida native from Davie, Florida, joins the Owls from Nova High School. The Big 8 MVP and All-Broward honoree helped lead the Titans to two District Championships in 2024 and 2025. Entering her senior season at Nova, Housey has averaged 20.2 points, 6.1 rebounds, 4.1 steals, 3.9 assists, and 1.1 blocks per game. In addition to basketball, Housey also competes in flag football as a wide receiver and runs cross country. Off the court, Housey was named to the A/B honor roll and received a silver cord for accumulating over 200 hours of service.

HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND \"I thought we competed really well, but unfortunately, we didn't have our legs under us. The physicality of Miami's team kind of wore us down early. We had some open looks that typically fall for us, and they just weren't falling, and against a team like Miami, you really need those shots to fall. Proud of our effort, and I know we can learn a lot from this game.\" NOTES AND TEAM STATS Carstensen led the Owls with a team-high 14 points on the night. Gewirtz led the team on the glass with four boards. Moors had a team-leading three assists. The Owls led the Hurricanes at the line with 58 percent to 50 percent.
