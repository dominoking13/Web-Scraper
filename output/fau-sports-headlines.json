    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – Late game heroics from freshman Yohann Sissoko lifted the Florida Atlantic men's basketball team past Boston College in an 83-78 overtime win at Eleanor R. Baldwin Arena on Monday night. The Owls (1-0) battled back from a late second half deficit versus the Eagles (0-1) to tie the game and missed just one shot in the extra five minutes to start the season with a victory, their first over a power conference team at home since December of 2002 against Miami. FIRST HALF A nearly full court pass to a wide-open redshirt sophomore guard Devin Vanterpool for the slam dunk opened the Owls' scoring. A 12-3 Owls run, highlighted by nine points from junior Xander Pintelon, gave FAU a nine-point lead. A three-pointer by redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams put Florida Atlantic up by 10 for the first time of the night. Boston College closed the deficit to one, but junior guard Kanaan Carlyle hit a late three-pointer to give the Owls a 35-31 advantage entering halftime. SECOND HALF Six straight points from Isaiah Elohim built Florida Atlantic's lead, with the redshirt sophomore guard putting together a highlight reel sequence of plays featuring a driving slam dunk followed by an acrobatic and-one. The Eagles tied the game with 10 minutes remaining and soon took a six-point lead off the 8-0 run. Boston College was up by nine with under five minutes left, but the lead was cut to three in less than a minute with back-to-back three pointers from Sissoko and Carlyle. Down by five with 46 seconds to play, the Owls forced a turnover to get the ball back, with Carlyle drawing the foul and sinking two free throws to cut the score to 66-63. The Eagles did not have an opportunity to close out the game, with Sissoko intercepting a pass and drilling a shot from beyond the arc to tie the score at 66 apiece with 31 seconds on the clock. Neither team scored again, sending the game into overtime. OVERTIME The duo of Carlyle and Sissoko came up clutch once again, with the former sinking a three to tie it at 78-78 and a driving layup from Sissoko to take a lead that the Owls did not relinquish. A three-pointer from Pintelon with just over a minute to go put Florida Atlantic up by six, sealing the victory. PRESS CONFERENCES GALLERY Gallery: (11-3-2025) MBB vs. Boston College STATS & NOTES The Owls last played an overtime game at the Elly in February of 2023, also an FAU victory. Among the five players with double digit scoring, Carlyle finished with 19 points to lead the team. Vanterpool nabbed a career high eight rebounds, seven coming in the first half.

    "content": "BOCA RATON, Fla. – The American Conference has named Mamadou Diarra as its Men's Soccer Offensive Player of the Year, the league announced on Thursday. In addition, the Owls' coaching staff, led by ninth-year Head Coach Joey Worthen, was named Staff of the Year. Fabrizio Cubeddu joined Diarra on the All-Conference First Team. Aboubacar Traore and Oliver Moller-Jensen earned their place on the Second Team, while Elias Asikainen was named to the All-Freshman team. Diarra becomes the fourth player in the 13-year history of the American Conference to repeat as Offensive Player of the Year. The fifth-year senior had another standout regular season, leading the Owls with six goals, including two game-winners, and 16 points. Worthen on Diarra \"This is a testament to Mo's hard work and his mentality. To receive this award two years in a row, he's proven that he's the best striker in our conference and one of the top in the country. I'm incredibly happy for him. This is well-deserved.\" Cubeddu led the Owls in total minutes while making starts at both outside back and in the midfield. The graduate senior logged two assists while starting all 15 matches in the regular season. Worthen on Cubeddu \"For Fabri to come back after three years away and earn his way onto the First Team, this is a full-circle moment, and it's certainly deserved. He's probably the most versatile player in the league, playing several different positions. He's had a tremendous impact on our team as a leader and a player.\" Traore earned all-conference honors for the second year in a row after a First Team nod in 2024. The Ivorian logged four goals to go along with five assists. He's now tied for third all-time in program history with 15 assists. Moller-Jensen adds another accolade after an All-Freshman team nod in 2023 and a Preseason All-Conference nod in 2024. Moller-Jensen led the American Conference with six assists while chipping in four goals as well. Worthen on Moller-Jensen and Traore \"Oli and Bouba are two of the most dangerous attacking players in our conference. They create goals. They score goals themselves. They've been doing it all year. Again, well-deserved recognition for them and for our team to get four players on the first and second teams.\" One of two freshmen on this year's team, the Finnish-born Asikainen made 10 appearances in the midfield, totaling 393 minutes. Worthen on Asikainen \"This is great recognition for Elias in his first taste of college soccer. For him to come in and get the minutes that he did is great, and I think there's a lot more in store for him in the future.\" Led by Worthen in his ninth season as head coach, associate head coach Tom Harman, goalkeeper coach Brad Shore, and assistant coach Rob Tomlin, the Owls won their third conference regular season title in program history and first since 2007. Worthen on the coaching staff \"I have a fantastic staff. Tom, Brad, and Rob do an unbelievable job. They are tireless workers. To assemble a team that has performed as it has, from recruiting to game plan and scouting, I am incredibly fortunate to have these individuals on my staff. To know that this award is voted on by our peers, our fellow coaches, is incredibly humbling.\" The Owls have earned a first-round bye in the American Conference tournament and will play either South Florida or Tulsa in the semifinals at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, November 12, in Charlotte, North Carolina.
