    "headline": "Florida Atlantic Names Ken Dawson-Scully, Ph.D., as Provost",
    "content": "Ken Dawson-Scully, Ph.D. Florida Atlantic University has named Ken Dawson-Scully, Ph.D., as its provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. As leader of Florida Atlantic’s Division of Academic Affairs, Dawson-Scully will oversee Florida Atlantic’s 10 colleges and more than 170 degree programs at the bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral levels across numerous academic disciplines for more than 32,000 students. “I am excited to welcome Ken back to Florida Atlantic,” said Florida Atlantic President Adam Hasner. “When I became president, I committed to conducting a national search for a provost who combined strong academic credentials with proven leadership in higher education, a deep understanding of the importance of supporting research within an R1 institution, experience in financial management and data driven decision-making, and who shared my vision for the university’s future. After looking nationwide, we discovered that the most qualified candidate was right here at home. I look forward to having Ken work as my partner as we accelerate our university’s ascent and continue driving toward even greater achievements. “I appreciate Dean Valery Forbes’ leadership and the work of the search committee, who brought thoroughness and insight to this process. Their efforts ensured that the university’s best interests were prioritized throughout the search and that we identified the most qualified leader to serve as our provost.” Dawson-Scully has served as the associate provost and senior vice president for research at Nova Southeastern University since 2021. He currently leads the Division of Research and Economic Development guiding research strategy, infrastructure, compliance, technology transfer, clinical research operations, and faculty and student research support. With over $185 million in active research funding at NSU, he directs a broad portfolio spanning federally funded projects, philanthropic initiatives, industry partnerships, and regional collaborations. Under his research leadership, NSU elevated from R2 status to the Carnegie Classification of “R1: Very High Research Activity,” reflecting transformative growth and national recognition. “I am grateful for the opportunity to serve Florida Atlantic in this role at such an important moment for the university,” said Dawson-Scully. “As I have said throughout this process, serving as provost at Florida Atlantic is my dream job. I look forward to partnering with President Hasner, our deans, and our faculty to strengthen teaching, elevate academic excellence and the learning experience, continue our intense focus on student success, and expand the already strong ties between our programs and the region’s workforce, creating even more opportunities for our extraordinary students.” Dawson-Scully also played a role in Florida Atlantic’s past successes. He served in several leadership roles during his 13 years (2008-2021) at the university, including as associate vice president for strategic initiatives (2018-2021) where, among other achievements, he led initiatives that dramatically increased National Merit Scholar enrollment. During the same time, he was also head of institutional partnerships at Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. At Florida Atlantic, Dawson-Scully also served as the director of the FAU Max Planck Honors Program, associate dean of graduate studies at the College of Science, and associate director of the FAU Brain Institute, among other roles. “President Hasner’s firm commitment to a comprehensive national search ensured that we evaluated top academic talent from across the country,” said Kim Dunn, Ph.D., member of the Florida Board of Governors, former chair of Florida Atlantic’s Faculty Senate, and committee member for the provost search. “From that distinguished pool, Ken Dawson-Scully emerged as a leader who could honor FAU’s past while boldly shaping its future. Ken’s experience, innovative vision, and deep understanding of FAU uniquely position him to guide the university into its next chapter of excellence.” A Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors and the Royal Entomological Society, Dawson-Scully has published extensively in leading scientific journals. His expertise spans translational neuroscience, neuroprotective compounds, stress physiology, and commercialization of academic research. Dawson-Scully earned his Ph.D. in physiology at the University of Toronto’s College of Medicine. “I am delighted that we were able to attract a candidate of such a high caliber as Ken and excited to work with him moving forward,” said Valery Forbes, dean of the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science and chair of the provost search committee. “I am grateful to everyone who contributed to the search, nominated qualified applicants, and engaged with the candidates who came to campus. I want to especially thank the members of the search committee for their commitment and collaboration during this entire process.” Dawson-Scully will assume the role of provost on Jan. 1, 2026, following Russ Ivy, Ph.D., who has served as interim provost and vice president for academic affairs. As interim provost, Ivy contributed to Florida Atlantic’s being named a Top 100 Public University by U.S. News and World Report and to FAU’s achieving the Carnegie Classification of “R1: Very High Research Activity” in February. Ivy has a long and distinguished career at FAU, including supervising the leadership of the Center for Global Engagement, for which his leadership was recently awarded the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities’ Michael P. Malone International Leadership Award in 2025. “I am grateful to Russ for his leadership as interim provost and for guiding the university’s Academic Affairs division through a period of significant transition and reform,” Hasner said. “Dr. Ivy has played an important role in moving the university forward, and I appreciate his continued work for the university in these efforts in the years ahead.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",

The way they work with us to execute an event of this size demonstrates how they take a creative and entrepreneurial approach with an incredible level of detail. It’s a lot of business fun.” Previous NobleCon conferences at the Executive Education buildings have featured a fireside chat with former U.S. President George W. Bush for NobleCon19 and three of the world’s most famous investors, Daymond John, Robert Herjavec, and Kevin O’Leary (aka “Mr. Wonderful”) from the ABC hit series “Shark Tank.” “Clearly, we’ve moved past the proof-of-concept phase,” said Mark Pinvidic, Noble’s managing partner and conference orchestrator. “Although we’ve been hosting NobleCon for more than two decades, attendance and interest in the conference have grown exponentially since the move.” For more information, conference, and registration details, visit www.nobleconference.com.

    "headline": "New FAU Lab Schools Campus Officially Celebrates its New Home",
    "content": "From left: State Representative Chip LaMarca, FAU Board of Trustees chairman Piero Bussani, Michael Morris, Billi Marcus, Lucy Henderson, Wayne Huizenga, Jr., FAU President Adam Hasner and Joel Herbst, Ed.D., vice president for PK-12 pre-baccalaureate programs and FAU Lab Schools superintendent Florida Atlantic University celebrated the official opening of its brand-new Boca Raton campus of A.D. Henderson University School and Florida Atlantic University High School today with a ribbon cutting ceremony. The nearly 62,000-square-foot complex houses the elementary, middle and high schools at the No. 2 public school system in the country. The state-of-the-art campus replaces the original home to ADHUS, which was built in 1968. Speakers during the dedication ceremony were FAU President Adam Hasner; Joel Herbst, Ed.D., vice president for PK-12 pre-baccalaureate programs and FAU Lab Schools superintendent; State Representative Chip LaMarca; Michael Morris of The Marcus Foundation; and FAU High School senior Olie Hallstrom. “A.D. Henderson and FAU High School not only set the standard for excellence but are redefining what K-12 education can look like,” said Hasner. “There is a reason that so many people from across the nation and the world come to visit our laboratory schools to see how our teachers, staff and students have such remarkable success. I am thankful to the many community members who brought this vision to life, and I am proud to see all that can be achieved when we work together to invest in education.” At the heart of the new campus is the Marcus Research and Innovation Center, a one-of-a-kind facility that won’t be found anywhere else in K-12 education across the globe, and a space that will serve as an incubator for the researcher and innovators of tomorrow, solving society’s most complex challenges. This building is home to the Biodesign Research Hub, which houses the school’s research program. In this space, students immerse themselves in cutting-edge fields and labs, including the Berlin Family Bioimaging Lab, the Wahoo Bay Ocean Sciences and Conservation Lab, the Neuroscience Lab, and the Simulated Operating Room Lab. It also includes a dark room and the Manjit Kaur High-Performance Computing Lab. The other half of the building features a Biomechanics Lab with spaces for robotics, alternative fuel vehicles, and is home to much of what is done within The Cane Institute for Advanced Technologies. It also houses the Skylab for drone and flight programs and a Rapid Prototyping Lab equipped with 3D printers, laser cutters and a hydrogel printer. The main entrance to the campus features a two-story, cutting-edge K-8 school building and a multi-use athletic complex. A university-level lecture hall provides a professional platform for enriching experiences such as mock trial, Model United Nations, speech and debate, science fair, and both student and staff research presentations. In addition to these advancements, a new archaeological dig site offers hands-on experiences that bring history and math lessons to life, while the robotic farming and drone Agricultural space blends plant sciences and robotics, including drone technology. The aquatic facility features a swimming pool for physical education and K-8 swimming programs, as well as a training ground to host national and international marine robotics competitions. There’s also an outdoor athletic complex with a synthetic turf track and soccer field. The administrative building serves as a hub for staff development, supporting the groundbreaking research the school’s educators continue to publish as they shape and innovate its one-of-a-kind schooling. “Our faculty and staff are the architects of signature student experiences,” said Herbst. “They make learning sticky by taking students on extraordinary journeys of discovery – into archaeological dig sites, through Da Vinci-inspired design studios, beneath the surface of the world’s oceans, and into neuroscience labs where they peer through a confocal microscope to unlock the secrets of a single cell. They leverage industry devices to provide hands-on learning, such as even performing laparoscopic surgery on green peppers and pumpkins. The Florida legislature believes in Herbst’s mission so much that ADHUS was awarded $2 million last session in the state budget to create the Center for Educational Strategy and Innovation at the Florida Atlantic Laboratory Schools, a rescue mission re-engineering education in Florida and ultimately, across the country. The center’s goal to scale STEM education to all students is critical and will pave the way for schools, school districts and universities in Florida to drastically improve student outcomes. “We are future-proofing education by looking to industry and the cutting edge of science to prepare students for what they must be ready to do now – and in the future,” said Herbst. “To accomplish this, our teachers are empowered to take bold risks, challenge norms, and push the boundaries of what was once thought impossible within the school walls. This is our mission, and our quest to reimagine public education will never end.” ADHUS opened on Sept. 16, 1968, as a developmental research laboratory school to enhance instruction and research to improve outcomes for all students throughout the country. The school was made possible through a $1.3 million gift from Lucy Henderson in honor of her late husband, Alexander D. Henderson. Capitalizing on the success of ADHUS, FAU High was established in 2004 as a fully immersed early college model. In 2014, a strategic plan with an extraordinary vision and mission was designed to reimagine and reengineer public education in both Florida and across the U.S. The FAU Lab Schools have been recognized three times as a National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education and six times as a Florida School of Excellence. A.D. Henderson is also rated as the No. 3 public elementary school and No. 5 public middle school in America, and FAU Lab Schools were recently recognized as a 2025 Cognia School of Distinction.

    "headline": "Notice of Proposed Changes to Non-Resident Tuition Fees",
    "content": "For the first time, Florida Atlantic has been named a “Top 100 Public University” by U.S. News & World Report. We are also one of only 21 universities nationwide to hold both a Carnegie R1 research designation and the distinction of being an “Opportunity University,” recognized for increasing student access and improving post-graduation outcomes. Florida Atlantic truly stands at the intersection of academic excellence and social mobility. As we succeed, so does the state. Florida’s higher education system continues to be ranked No. 1 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. This recognition is made possible in large part due to the generous investment from the state, which keeps the cost of attendance at our public universities among the lowest in the country. To support continued improvements across the State University System of Florida, the Board of Governors has granted universities the flexibility to increase tuition for non-resident (out-of-state) students. While many state universities already implemented this change beginning in Fall 2025, Florida Atlantic chose to delay this increase, recognizing that such an adjustment would have been too short notice for our non-resident students and families. Looking ahead to the next academic year, we are now considering a tuition adjustment for non-resident students to begin in Fall 2026. On Tuesday, November 18, 2025, Florida Atlantic University will present a proposal to the university’s Board of Trustees recommending a 15% increase in tuition for non-resident students, effective Fall 2026. This change will not affect tuition or fees for in-state students. This will be the first increase to non-resident tuition and fees at Florida Atlantic in over a decade. Even with the proposed change, Florida Atlantic will remain one of the most affordable universities in the nation for out-of-state students. Florida Atlantic is increasingly becoming a top-choice destination for students from across the state, the nation, and around the world. This past year, we received over 57,000 applications and enrolled the most academically competitive class in our university’s history. The revenue generated by the proposed increase will help us continue to elevate our institution and provide the world-class experience our students deserve. Thank you for being a part of Florida Atlantic’s extraordinary journey.

Florida Atlantic University received a $1.6 million gift from long-time Boca Raton resident Bob Schattner, which will be used to continue providing scholarships that he established 15 years ago in perpetuity. Schattner established the Robert L. Schattner Entrepreneurial Scholarship in Business in 2010 to support students with financial need who have taken at least one entrepreneur class and who may start their own companies one day. To date, the scholarships have benefitted more than 30 students. He also established a separate fund to aid any student who faces life challenges that could derail their pursuit of higher education. Bob Schattner and his wife, Shula Fleischer. “Bob generously donated his time, talent and treasures to support students in our College of Business over the past 15 years, and we truly appreciate him embracing Florida Atlantic as his hometown university,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “This most recent contribution will carry on Bob’s legacy of helping today’s students become the business leaders of the future.” Schattner was the founder of Omnimed, Inc., a New Jersey-based medical supply manufacturing company. His expertise ranged from marketing, management and finance to patents and trademarks. He holds several patents for medical equipment. Schattner was always willing to share his secrets to business success and mentor student entrepreneurs. “He wanted to be connected to the students, and he wanted to give of his knowledge,” said Shula Fleischer, his longtime partner. “He had such varied experiences. Through these scholarships, his legacy can live on forever.” Schattner’s civic involvement was deep and varied – he had a passion for volunteering and sharing his knowledge. He developed and taught the Entrepreneurial Studies Program at Burlington County College, where Omnimed was based. As a Boca Raton resident, Bob relished his volunteer experience at the Boca Regional Hospital and Florida Atlantic. He was an inaugural member in 2012 of the Entrepreneur in Residence of the Florida Atlantic University College of Business’ Adams Center for Entrepreneurship. “Bob was simultaneously patient but also pushed students to achieve by maintaining high expectations,” said Kevin Cox, Ph.D., director of the Adams Center for Entrepreneurship. “The students here benefitted greatly from Bob's extensive experience in medical and manufacturing industries.\" If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",
