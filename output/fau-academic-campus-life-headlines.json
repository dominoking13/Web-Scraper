    "headline": "Notice of Proposed Changes to Non-Resident Tuition Fees",
    "content": "For the first time, Florida Atlantic has been named a “Top 100 Public University” by U.S. News & World Report. We are also one of only 21 universities nationwide to hold both a Carnegie R1 research designation and the distinction of being an “Opportunity University,” recognized for increasing student access and improving post-graduation outcomes. Florida Atlantic truly stands at the intersection of academic excellence and social mobility. As we succeed, so does the state. Florida’s higher education system continues to be ranked No. 1 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. This recognition is made possible in large part due to the generous investment from the state, which keeps the cost of attendance at our public universities among the lowest in the country. To support continued improvements across the State University System of Florida, the Board of Governors has granted universities the flexibility to increase tuition for non-resident (out-of-state) students. While many state universities already implemented this change beginning in Fall 2025, Florida Atlantic chose to delay this increase, recognizing that such an adjustment would have been too short notice for our non-resident students and families. Looking ahead to the next academic year, we are now considering a tuition adjustment for non-resident students to begin in Fall 2026. On Tuesday, November 18, 2025, Florida Atlantic University will present a proposal to the university’s Board of Trustees recommending a 15% increase in tuition for non-resident students, effective Fall 2026. This change will not affect tuition or fees for in-state students. This will be the first increase to non-resident tuition and fees at Florida Atlantic in over a decade. Even with the proposed change, Florida Atlantic will remain one of the most affordable universities in the nation for out-of-state students. Florida Atlantic is increasingly becoming a top-choice destination for students from across the state, the nation, and around the world. This past year, we received over 57,000 applications and enrolled the most academically competitive class in our university’s history. The revenue generated by the proposed increase will help us continue to elevate our institution and provide the world-class experience our students deserve. Thank you for being a part of Florida Atlantic’s extraordinary journey.
