Proud of our effort, and I know we can learn a lot from this game."" NOTES AND TEAM STATS Carstensen led the Owls with a team-high 14 points on the night.

"Owls Come Up Short Against Green Wave","NEW ORLEANS – In its final road contest of the 2025 regular season, the Florida Atlantic football team fell to American Conference contender Tulane by a score of 35-24 on Saturday afternoon. The Owls (4-6, 3-4) were led by redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp, who set the individual single game program record in both completions (39) and attempts (57) while throwing for a season best 375 yards. He was assisted in the passing game by career best outings from redshirt junior WR Easton Messer (133 yards) and redshirt sophomore WR Asaad Waseem (11 receptions). VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF Florida Atlantic's offense marched right into Green Wave (8-2, 5-1) territory on the opening drive, halted by an interception in the end zone. The defense forced consecutive three-and-outs before Tulane capitalized on a fumbled punt return and scored on the next play. The Owls put points on the board on the following possession, set up by Veltkamp finding Messer on a first-and-23 who turned a pass short of the sticks into a 50-yard gain. The drive led to a field goal from redshirt senior K Garrison Smith. After another Tulane touchdown to close the first quarter, Florida Atlantic responded with a 75-yard drive culminating in Veltkamp finding redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt on fourth-and-goal for his third straight game with a receiving touchdown to narrow the gap to 14-10. The Green Wave scored once more to send the Owls to the locker room trailing 21-10. SECOND HALF FAU's defense stopped Tulane on two consecutive drives, first forcing a punt at midfield and then an interception by freshman DE Josh Roberts, before a touchdown late in third quarter extended the Green Wave lead to three scores. Not going down without a fight, Florida Atlantic put together another 75-yard scoring drive finishing with a score by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton from one yard out to cut the deficit to 28-16. While Tulane found the end zone one more time with under five minutes to go, the Owls had one more drive left in them.
