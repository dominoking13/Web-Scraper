"Owls’ Rally Falls Short in NCAA First Round","ORLANDO, Fla. – Florida Atlantic men's soccer saw its season come to an end on Thursday night in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. The Owls mounted a furious second half rally before ultimately falling short in a 3-2 defeat to UCF. The Knights advance to face Georgetown in the second round on Sunday. The Owls owned possession early and had four corner kicks inside the first 10 minutes. The Knights opened the scoring, however, with their first shot on goal in the 15th minute. They doubled the lead in the 24th minute to take a 2-0 advantage into halftime. The visitors cut the deficit to one early in the second half. Oliver Moller-Jensen saved a ball from going over the end line for a goal kick. Mamadou Diarra picked up the loose ball and sent a pass across the six-yard box, where Andreas Raisanen ripped a side-volley past the UCF keeper to make it 2-1. UCF responded just four minutes later to reassert a two-goal lead with 30 minutes to play in the match. The Owls made one final push inside the last 10 minutes. Aboubacar Traore's cross found Diarra, who headed home his ninth goal of the season to make it 3-2 with 9:50 on the clock. In the 88th minute, Eli Conway's shot from the top of the penalty area caromed off the left post and across the goal line but stayed out. That would be the final chance for Florida Atlantic. The final shot count was 14-11 in favor of UCF, with eight on goal compared to six for the Owls. Goalkeeper Alfred Mikkelsen finished with three saves.

The Owls fall to 2-2, while South Alabama improves to 4-1 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED The Owls started off hot as a fast break layup from Jess Moors capped off a 10-1 opening run with FAU leading by nine at the opening media break. Grace Carstensen's first triple of the day kept the Owls' lead at six, 15-9, with just under two minutes to play in the first, but the Jaguars closed the quarter on a 6-1 run to cut the FAU lead to just one, 16-15, at the end of the first.

"Owls Fall in Waning Seconds to UConn, 48-45","BOCA RATON, Fla. – In a game featuring nearly 1,300 yards of combined offense and four second half lead changes, the Florida Atlantic football team fell just short to UConn on Saturday evening at Flagler Credit Union Stadium, 48-45. The Owls' (4-7) 300th game in program history came down to each team's final drive, but the Huskies (9-4) held on for the three-point win. VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF After trading field goals on each team's respective first possession, UConn scored touchdowns on its next three opening-quarter series to take a 24-3 lead. To start the second, FAU redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp made good on two passes before giving it off to redshirt junior WR Easton Messer for a 39-yard rushing touchdown. After forcing a Huskies punt, Veltkamp capped off a drive by taking it in himself, going head over heels into the end zone for a 17-yard score to make it a one-possession game at 24-17. UConn would add a late field goal to take a 27-17 lead into the locker room. SECOND HALF The Owls' momentum carried over into the third quarter, with back-to-back touchdowns to pull ahead for the first time. The first was a rushing score from 11 yards out by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton; the second, on 4th-and-1 from their own 10, saw Veltkamp hit redshirt junior wideout Dominique Henry in stride on a quick slant, and he took it 90 yards to put FAU up 31-27. UConn regained the advantage on two straight scores of its own, and led 41-31 with 10:11 to go in the game. But the Owls fought back once again. With 7:13 left, on 4th-and-11, Veltkamp found Messer over the middle for a 33-yard touchdown, and five minutes later, Veltkamp scampered into the end zone for his second rushing score of the game, from 11 yards out. With 2:11 left, FAU led 45-41. On the ensuing possession, the Huskies put together a 15-play, 75-yard drive for the fourth lead change of the second half. The Owls got the ball back with 22 seconds left, and Veltkamp marched the Owls into field goal range with two quick first-down completions. But the game-tying field goal attempt from 36 yards at the horn was wide left, and UConn survived. OFFENSE Veltkamp finished the game 42-for-55 for 494 yards. He set the single-game completion record for the second straight week and is now the new single-game record holder for passing yards in a game, previously set in 2019. He also now holds the new single-season record for completions (previously 291, he now sits at 326), and went over 3,000 yards, the fourth such instance in a season (3,458, now third in history). For the first time in school history, FAU had three receivers with 100 or more yards in a game. Henry (7 catches for 157 yards – both career highs and his first 100-yard game), Messer (11 for 119) and redshirt sophomore Asaad Wassem (12 for 109 – like Henry, new career best and also his first 100-yard game) all went over the century mark. Veltkamp and Henry's 90-yard connection is the third-longest pass in school history. Messer is the first non-QB in FAU history to have a passing, rushing and receiving touchdown in the same season. Shields-Dutton led the backs with 77 yards on 14 carries, followed by redshirt sophomore Gemari Sands' 44 yards on 11 totes. DEFENSE Leading the way in tackles was junior LB Leon Hart Jr. with nine stops. He now has 101 tackles in his career. Just behind him with seven apiece were two DBs, redshirt senior Terez Reid and redshirt junior Jayden Sweeney. Freshman DE Josh Roberts had a solo sack, and splitting the other was redshirt senior DT Bryce Langston and redshirt senior DL Naejaun Barber.

"Florida Atlantic Takes Sunshine Slam Semifinal","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Florida Atlantic's men's basketball team is heading to the Sunshine Slam's championship game after defeating Loyola Marymount by a score of 64-52 on Monday night at the Ocean Center. The Owls (5-1) delivered the Lions' (6-1) their first loss of the season in the tournament's semifinal matchup behind junior guard Kanaan Carlyle's second consecutive 20-point outing and redshirt sophomore Devin Vanterpool with another all-around performance highlighted by his 14 points and a relentless defensive effort. FIRST HALF The Owls jumped out to an early lead with Carlyle, whose momentum carried over from the previous game, with a four-point play three minutes in. FAU's lead grew to as much as 13 before LMU went on a run to close the gap to four. An offensive drought was ended by a ferocious driving dunk from Xander Pintelon, part of a perfect first half from the field for the junior forward. The hot shooting start continued up to the final buzzer, with Vanterpool drilling an attempt from beyond the arc in the closing seconds to send the Owls into the locker room with a 41-34 lead. SECOND HALF LMU worked its way back into the game, cutting the deficit to four in the opening minutes of the final period. The Owls never surrendered the lead, responding with a 12-2 run over the course of four minutes to go up by 11. The Lions had one more run in them to trail by two with just under 10 minutes remaining, but Florida Atlantic soon built its lead back up to double digits, this time from attacking the paint. An explosive sequence by Vanterpool on both ends of the floor ensued, soaring for a two-handed block to deny a dunk attempt despite a four-inch height disadvantage, and then swishing a step-back jumper. It was all FAU the rest of the way, surrendering just two field goals to the Lions in the final five minutes.

"Meet Wendol Philord","Philord is wrapping up his sixth and final year of collegiate eligibility, two seasons after transferring from an NAIA school at Keiser to Division I. The Miami native began his football journey when he was just three years old. One thing that sticks with him to this day is the bonds and relationships he quickly created with his teammates. These relationships were a family, without being blood related as described by Philord. ""My team and I, we played together all the way growing up from middle school to high school. Of course we had some people that left, but the main people, we stayed together."" said Philord. Philord began his freshman season amidst the Coronavirus pandemic, resulting in his first collegiate campaign being postponed from fall 2020 to the spring of 2021. Although Philord had to adjust to this change, he acknowledges that the experience helped him improve his game. ""After a season, you must wait a whole year to do it again. But this year, I had a season, then I had a short two-month break, and then it was back into another season."" Philord believed the shortened break helped keep him in shape and focused on the upcoming season. Throughout his time at Keiser, Philord went on to lead his team in multiple categories. In his freshman year, Philord matched a program single season record with six interceptions on his way to earning the MSC Sun Division First Team Honors. In his sophomore year, as Philord found his way as the designated return man. He led the NAIA in total return yards (785) while leading the Seahawks in interceptions with four. He was named a first-team All-Sun Conference selection as a defensive back for the second straight year. That same season, Philord and his Keiser team advanced to the semifinals of the NAIA Football Championship Series, where they lost to Northwestern College. He recalls the moment as leaving a sour taste in his mouth. The loss stuck with Philord and his teammates, which pushed them to work harder and had them focus on one task for the next season: winning a National Championship. In Philord's junior year, he continued to perform at an exceptional level. He returned 17 kicks for a total of 424 yards and one score and returned 24 punts, three for a score. Defensively he had three forced fumbles and three interceptions on the year. It was that junior year after three seasons of dedication and hard work that Philord was able to capture that elusive National Championship he had desired. Besides the birth of his son, Philord described this as the happiest moment in his life. ""Being able to win the first national championship for the Keiser football program, being a part of that team, everything was just unbelievable."" In 2024, Philord made the transfer to Florida Atlantic, which was set to be his final year of eligibility. That season, he recorded 40 total tackles, four deflected passes and two forced fumbles and took on responsibility as a leader. In late 2024, the NCAA approved a blanket waiver, which granted an additional year of eligibility to for JUCO (Junior College) transfers. At the time, Philord was preparing for the NFL Pro Day when he learned the news. He spoke with his agent who encouraged him to take advantage of the opportunity in front of him. Philord's leadership role continued in his second year with the Owls, being named a team captain. In eight games, he ties the team high with five pass breakups and has totaled 15 tackles, one for a loss.","https://fausports.com/news/2025/11/24/football-meet-wendol-philord"
