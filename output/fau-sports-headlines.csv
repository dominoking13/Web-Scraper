"Owls Come Up Short Against Green Wave","NEW ORLEANS – In its final road contest of the 2025 regular season, the Florida Atlantic football team fell to American Conference contender Tulane by a score of 35-24 on Saturday afternoon. The Owls (4-6, 3-4) were led by redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp, who set the individual single game program record in both completions (39) and attempts (57) while throwing for a season best 375 yards. He was assisted in the passing game by career best outings from redshirt junior WR Easton Messer (133 yards) and redshirt sophomore WR Asaad Waseem (11 receptions). VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF Florida Atlantic's offense marched right into Green Wave (8-2, 5-1) territory on the opening drive, halted by an interception in the end zone. The defense forced consecutive three-and-outs before Tulane capitalized on a fumbled punt return and scored on the next play. The Owls put points on the board on the following possession, set up by Veltkamp finding Messer on a first-and-23 who turned a pass short of the sticks into a 50-yard gain. The drive led to a field goal from redshirt senior K Garrison Smith. After another Tulane touchdown to close the first quarter, Florida Atlantic responded with a 75-yard drive culminating in Veltkamp finding redshirt junior WR Jayshon Platt on fourth-and-goal for his third straight game with a receiving touchdown to narrow the gap to 14-10. The Green Wave scored once more to send the Owls to the locker room trailing 21-10. SECOND HALF FAU's defense stopped Tulane on two consecutive drives, first forcing a punt at midfield and then an interception by freshman DE Josh Roberts, before a touchdown late in third quarter extended the Green Wave lead to three scores. Not going down without a fight, Florida Atlantic put together another 75-yard scoring drive finishing with a score by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton from one yard out to cut the deficit to 28-16. While Tulane found the end zone one more time with under five minutes to go, the Owls had one more drive left in them. Veltkamp connected with Messer for an 11-yard touchdown and Waseem for the ensuing two-point conversion. The onside kick came up short, leaving the 35-24 final. OFFENSE Veltkamp has thrown for 300+ passing yards in four games, most by an Owl quarterback in a single season since Chris Robison in 2019. Through 10 games in 2025, he is now eight completions away from setting the program's single-season record. Messer had his third 100+ yard game of the season, reaching 117 in the first half alone. He has hauled in 83 catches in 2025, now second all-time in program history for a single season. Platt is the first Florida Atlantic player to log a receiving touchdown in three straight games since LaJohntay Wester in 2022. Redshirt junior WR Dominique Henry recorded career highs in both receptions (six) and yards (78). DEFENSE Leading in tackles with a double-digit performance for the second week in a row was redshirt junior LB Leon Hart Jr. with 13, also notching 1.5 tackles for loss. Roberts' interception was the Owls' third of the season. Junior DE Deshaun Batiste and redshirt junior CJ Doggette Jr. joined forces for a sack.

Florida Atlantic has steadily improved its overall GSR in each of the seven years under Vice President and Director of Athletics Brian White, including three straight years of a record 90 percent. ""Consistently achieving a record high Graduation Success Rate is a point of pride for the athletics department and the university,"" said White. ""Our student-athletes remain steadfast in their commitment to academics, as evidenced by this, our high APR, and our 20 consecutive semesters with a cumulative GPA of better than 3.0. We continue to compete at championship levels on and off the field and I am grateful for the dedication displayed by our student-athletes, coaches, and staff to our mission."" Florida Atlantic was one of nine schools from the American Conference to meet the 90-percent threshold, while a total of 10 FAU teams achieved a 100 percent GSR: men's basketball, men's golf, men's swimming & diving, men's tennis, women's golf, softball, women's soccer, women's swimming & diving, women's track and volleyball.
