"Florida Atlantic Takes Sunshine Slam Semifinal","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Florida Atlantic's men's basketball team is heading to the Sunshine Slam's championship game after defeating Loyola Marymount by a score of 64-52 on Monday night at the Ocean Center. The Owls (5-1) delivered the Lions' (6-1) their first loss of the season in the tournament's semifinal matchup behind junior guard Kanaan Carlyle's second consecutive 20-point outing and redshirt sophomore Devin Vanterpool with another all-around performance highlighted by his 14 points and a relentless defensive effort. FIRST HALF The Owls jumped out to an early lead with Carlyle, whose momentum carried over from the previous game, with a four-point play three minutes in. FAU's lead grew to as much as 13 before LMU went on a run to close the gap to four. An offensive drought was ended by a ferocious driving dunk from Xander Pintelon, part of a perfect first half from the field for the junior forward. The hot shooting start continued up to the final buzzer, with Vanterpool drilling an attempt from beyond the arc in the closing seconds to send the Owls into the locker room with a 41-34 lead. SECOND HALF LMU worked its way back into the game, cutting the deficit to four in the opening minutes of the final period. The Owls never surrendered the lead, responding with a 12-2 run over the course of four minutes to go up by 11. The Lions had one more run in them to trail by two with just under 10 minutes remaining, but Florida Atlantic soon built its lead back up to double digits, this time from attacking the paint. An explosive sequence by Vanterpool on both ends of the floor ensued, soaring for a two-handed block to deny a dunk attempt despite a four-inch height disadvantage, and then swishing a step-back jumper. It was all FAU the rest of the way, surrendering just two field goals to the Lions in the final five minutes. PRESS CONFERENCE GALLERY Gallery: (11-24-2025) MBB vs. LMU STATS & NOTES For the third time in four seasons, Florida Atlantic has won four out of its first five games. The Owls have not trailed at any point in their last four victories. With 24 points, Carlyle reached a new FAU career high for the second straight game. Redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams, the team's leader in blocks, totaled three in the first half and finished the night with a career high of four.

HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND ""I felt like we fought really hard to get back in the game.

NOTES AND TEAM STATS Three Owls finished in double figures in the win. Moors led the way for the Owls with a team-high 15 points, shooting 57 percent (4-of-7) from the field, 50 percent (1-of-2) from 3-point range, and going a perfect 100 percent (6-of-6) at the line.
