"Owls Fall in Waning Seconds to UConn, 48-45","BOCA RATON, Fla. – In a game featuring nearly 1,300 yards of combined offense and four second half lead changes, the Florida Atlantic football team fell just short to UConn on Saturday evening at Flagler Credit Union Stadium, 48-45. The Owls' (4-7) 300th game in program history came down to each team's final drive, but the Huskies (9-4) held on for the three-point win. VIDEO RECAP FIRST HALF After trading field goals on each team's respective first possession, UConn scored touchdowns on its next three opening-quarter series to take a 24-3 lead. To start the second, FAU redshirt junior QB Caden Veltkamp made good on two passes before giving it off to redshirt junior WR Easton Messer for a 39-yard rushing touchdown. After forcing a Huskies punt, Veltkamp capped off a drive by taking it in himself, going head over heels into the end zone for a 17-yard score to make it a one-possession game at 24-17. UConn would add a late field goal to take a 27-17 lead into the locker room. SECOND HALF The Owls' momentum carried over into the third quarter, with back-to-back touchdowns to pull ahead for the first time. The first was a rushing score from 11 yards out by sophomore RB Kaden Shields-Dutton; the second, on 4th-and-1 from their own 10, saw Veltkamp hit redshirt junior wideout Dominique Henry in stride on a quick slant, and he took it 90 yards to put FAU up 31-27. UConn regained the advantage on two straight scores of its own, and led 41-31 with 10:11 to go in the game. But the Owls fought back once again. With 7:13 left, on 4th-and-11, Veltkamp found Messer over the middle for a 33-yard touchdown, and five minutes later, Veltkamp scampered into the end zone for his second rushing score of the game, from 11 yards out. With 2:11 left, FAU led 45-41. On the ensuing possession, the Huskies put together a 15-play, 75-yard drive for the fourth lead change of the second half. The Owls got the ball back with 22 seconds left, and Veltkamp marched the Owls into field goal range with two quick first-down completions. But the game-tying field goal attempt from 36 yards at the horn was wide left, and UConn survived. OFFENSE Veltkamp finished the game 42-for-55 for 494 yards. He set the single-game completion record for the second straight week and is now the new single-game record holder for passing yards in a game, previously set in 2019. He also now holds the new single-season record for completions (previously 291, he now sits at 326), and went over 3,000 yards, the fourth such instance in a season (3,458, now third in history). For the first time in school history, FAU had three receivers with 100 or more yards in a game. Henry (7 catches for 157 yards – both career highs and his first 100-yard game), Messer (11 for 119) and redshirt sophomore Asaad Wassem (12 for 109 – like Henry, new career best and also his first 100-yard game) all went over the century mark. Veltkamp and Henry's 90-yard connection is the third-longest pass in school history. Messer is the first non-QB in FAU history to have a passing, rushing and receiving touchdown in the same season. Shields-Dutton led the backs with 77 yards on 14 carries, followed by redshirt sophomore Gemari Sands' 44 yards on 11 totes. DEFENSE Leading the way in tackles was junior LB Leon Hart Jr. with nine stops. He now has 101 tackles in his career. Just behind him with seven apiece were two DBs, redshirt senior Terez Reid and redshirt junior Jayden Sweeney. Freshman DE Josh Roberts had a solo sack, and splitting the other was redshirt senior DT Bryce Langston and redshirt senior DL Naejaun Barber.

"Florida Atlantic Takes Sunshine Slam Semifinal","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Florida Atlantic's men's basketball team is heading to the Sunshine Slam's championship game after defeating Loyola Marymount by a score of 64-52 on Monday night at the Ocean Center. The Owls (5-1) delivered the Lions' (6-1) their first loss of the season in the tournament's semifinal matchup behind junior guard Kanaan Carlyle's second consecutive 20-point outing and redshirt sophomore Devin Vanterpool with another all-around performance highlighted by his 14 points and a relentless defensive effort. FIRST HALF The Owls jumped out to an early lead with Carlyle, whose momentum carried over from the previous game, with a four-point play three minutes in. FAU's lead grew to as much as 13 before LMU went on a run to close the gap to four. An offensive drought was ended by a ferocious driving dunk from Xander Pintelon, part of a perfect first half from the field for the junior forward. The hot shooting start continued up to the final buzzer, with Vanterpool drilling an attempt from beyond the arc in the closing seconds to send the Owls into the locker room with a 41-34 lead. SECOND HALF LMU worked its way back into the game, cutting the deficit to four in the opening minutes of the final period. The Owls never surrendered the lead, responding with a 12-2 run over the course of four minutes to go up by 11. The Lions had one more run in them to trail by two with just under 10 minutes remaining, but Florida Atlantic soon built its lead back up to double digits, this time from attacking the paint. An explosive sequence by Vanterpool on both ends of the floor ensued, soaring for a two-handed block to deny a dunk attempt despite a four-inch height disadvantage, and then swishing a step-back jumper. It was all FAU the rest of the way, surrendering just two field goals to the Lions in the final five minutes. PRESS CONFERENCE GALLERY Gallery: (11-24-2025) MBB vs. LMU STATS & NOTES For the third time in four seasons, Florida Atlantic has won four out of its first five games. The Owls have not trailed at any point in their last four victories. With 24 points, Carlyle reached a new FAU career high for the second straight game. Redshirt sophomore forward Devin Williams, the team's leader in blocks, totaled three in the first half and finished the night with a career high of four. Pintelon hauled in nine rebounds, the most by an Owl on the season. The team won the rebounding battle over the Lions 42-29.

Baldwin Arena. The Owls improve to 3-3 overall, and Air Force falls to 3-4 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED Air Force opened the contest on an 8-4 run, but the Owls answered back with an 8-4 run of their own, capped off by Vivian Onugha's first basket of the day, to tie things up at 12-12 with just under three minutes remaining in the first. FAU took the lead at 17-14, but an Air Force triple tied the back-and-forth contest at 17-all to close the first. The Falcons retook the lead to open the second, 21-17. Destyne Jackson brought the Owls back within two at 21-17 at the 7:40-minute mark.

Capitalizing on numerous Air Force turnovers, FAU produced a dominant 19-7 run, capped off by a triple from Madi Gewirtz, to retake the lead 45-43.

HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND ""I felt like we fought really hard to get back in the game.

HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND I'm really proud of our effort today. It was a complete team win. I thought we fought for 45 minutes. Even though it wasn't pretty offensively, I thought we had a great defensive effort and followed the game plan extremely well. We had some big plays down the stretch, Jess Moors' layup in transition to put us into overtime, and then her steal late came up huge. Also, Michiyah Simmons, I thought she had some big plays offensively to keep us in the game. But overall, a great team win, and really proud of this team for continuing to fight and never giving in."" NOTES AND TEAM STATS Three Owls finished in double digits on the day. Destyne Jackson and Simmons each had a team-high 12 points. Jackson shot 42 percent (5-of-12) from the field and 29 percent (2-of-7) from beyond the arc, while Simmons shot 33 percent (3-of-9) from the field, 40 percent (2-of-5) from 3-point range, and went a perfect 100 percent (4-of-4) at the line.

Baldwin Arena. The Owls improve to 3-3 overall, and Air Force falls to 3-4 on the season. HOW IT HAPPENED Air Force opened the contest on an 8-4 run, but the Owls answered back with an 8-4 run of their own, capped off by Vivian Onugha's first basket of the day, to tie things up at 12-12 with just under three minutes remaining in the first.

The Owls maintained their advantage, but a late Air Force triple closed out the 76-71 contest in favor of the Owls. HEAR FROM HEAD COACH LEANN FREELAND ""I felt like we fought really hard to get back in the game. We started out extremely flat, which I believe is due to the physicality of the game on Monday, so we had to get refocused at half. Our full-court pressure definitely got us back in the game and enabled us to force the turnovers we needed to score some easy buckets. NOTES AND TEAM STATS Three Owls finished in double figures in the win. Moors led the way for the Owls with a team-high 15 points, shooting 57 percent (4-of-7) from the field, 50 percent (1-of-2) from 3-point range, and going a perfect 100 percent (6-of-6) at the line.

Onugha finished with a team-leading seven boards and added a block in the contest. The Owls had a strong second-half performance, outscoring the Falcons 40-35 in the final two periods.
