"Chicago Fed's Goolsbee says he's cautious about further rate cuts during shutdown","Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Thursday expressed hesitation about lowering interest rates further because the government shutdown has resulted in a blackout on key inflation data. While Goolsbee has otherwise been an advocate for gradually lowering rates, the central bank official said during a CNBC interview that he has concerns over the lack of important price reports, particularly with general inflation recently trending higher. ""If there are problems developing on the inflation side, it's going to be a fair amount bit of time before we see that, where if it starts to deteriorate on the job market side, we're going to see that pretty much right away,"" Goolsbee said. ""So that makes me even more uneasy ... with front-loading rate cuts and counting on the inflation that we have seen in the last three months to just be transitory and assume that they're going to go away."" Goolsbee spoke as the Chicago Fed updated its own dashboard of labor market indicators. The data set indicated a stable unemployment rate in October and a steady pace of hirings and layoffs. The Chicago Fed's unemployment rate indicator was at 4.36% for the month, up just one one-hundredth of a percentage point from September. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics won't release its consumer price index report for October, which had been scheduled for next week. The BLS did put out a report for September despite the shutdown, as that particular count is used for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. That report showed inflation running at a 3% annual rate, compared with the Fed's goal of 2%. Whether the Commerce Department releases its personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge, depends on getting the shutdown resolved. Goolsbee said the lack of inflation reports concerns him, as three-month trends before the shutdown showed core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, running at a 3.6% annualized pace. ""Medium-run, I'm not hawkish on rates. I believe that the settling point for rates is going to be a fair bit below where it is today,"" he said. ""When it's foggy, let's just be a little careful and slow down."" Goolsbee will get a vote when the Federal Open Market Committee meets in December to decide whether to cut rates again following reductions at the prior two meetings. However, he will rotate to being an alternate in 2026 before returning to a voting role in 2027. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"Job cuts in October hit highest level for the month in 22 years, Challenger says","Layoff announcements soared in October as companies recalibrated staffing levels during the artificial intelligence boom, a sign of potential trouble ahead for the labor market, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Job cuts for the month totaled 153,074, a 183% surge from September and 175% higher than the same month a year ago. It was the highest level for any October since 2003. This has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009. ""Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,"" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at the firm. ""At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable."" The report provides a glimpse into the labor market at a time when the government has suspended data gathering and releases during the shutdown in Washington, D.C. To be sure, the Challenger monthly numbers can be highly volatile, and an accelerated pace of layoffs has yet to show up in state-level weekly jobless claim filings that continue to come in despite the shutdown. Payrolls processing firm ADP reported that October saw net job growth of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector. However, the report comes at a time when Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern about a softening labor market. The central bank has lowered its benchmark interest rate twice since September and is expected to approve another quarter percentage point reduction in December as policymakers look to get ahead of any more serious problems. Challenger reports the highest level of layoffs coming from the technology sector amid a time of restructuring due to AI integration. Companies in the sector announced 33,281 cuts, nearly six times the level in September. Consumer products also saw a sharp gain to 3,409, while nonprofits, an area hit hard by the shutdown, listed 27,651 cuts year to date, up 419% from the same point in 2024. In total, companies have announced 1.1 million cuts this year, a 65% increase from a year ago and the highest level since the Covid pandemic year of 2020. October saw the highest total for any month in the fourth quarter since 2008. ""Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,"" Challenger said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"'We're past peak-restrictiveness,' BOE governor says, as bets rise on Christmas rate cut","LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday voted narrowly to hold interest rates steady, exercising caution ahead of the government's Autumn Budget in November. Out of the BOE's nine-member monetary policy committee, five members voted to hold the key interest rate, known as Bank Rate, at 4%, while four opted for a 25 basis point cut. The vote was slimmer than expected with economists polled by Reuters expecting a 6-3 split in favor of a hold. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey signaled to CNBC that rate cuts are coming, with economists now pricing in a pre-Christmas rate cut. ""We're past peak-restrictiveness, which is what you'd expect given that we've cut interest rates five times [since Aug.2024]. For my part, I feel policy is still restrictive, but it's past peak restriction,"" he told CNBC's Ritika Gupta. As for the timing of the next cut, Bailey said he would be watching inflation and labor market data that'll be released before the last monetary policy meeting of the year, on Dec.18. ""I'll certainly be looking at the rest of this year and the evidence we see between now and our last meeting,"" Bailey noted, adding that the MPC would also be able to incorporate Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget, due Nov.26, into the central bank's assessment. The central bank said in a statement that the inflation rate, at 3.8% in September, had likely peaked and that a disinflationary trend was underway. This was ""supported by the still restrictive stance of monetary policy,"" it said. ""This is reflected in an easing of pay growth and services price inflation. Underlying disinflation is being underpinned by subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market,"" the bank added. The BOE cautioned that future rate cuts ""will therefore depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. If progress on disinflation continues, Bank Rate is likely to continue on a gradual downward path."" ""I think this is the doves winning the argument,"" Victoria Clarke, U.K. chief economist at Santander CIB, told CNBC Thursday. ""[BOE Governor Andrew] Bailey has made it clear he wants a bit more data and that was certainly my judgement, that there is a lot of value in waiting for December. You've got two more CPI [inflation] prints coming and two more labor market prints and, of course, this massive budget,"" she told CNBC's Decision Time. Yields on U.K. government bonds fell across the board, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt shedding almost 3 basis points. Meanwhile the British pound trimmed earlier gains to trade 0.18% higher against the U.S. dollar. The meeting on Thursday was the last one before the Autumn Budget later this month. Economists had said that while they believed the central bank was more likely to hold rates steady, it was not a given. ""It's not a case of whether they will cut interest rates at some point — the answer to that is yes, we believe they will, ""Dean Turner, chief euro zone and U.K. Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office, had said Tuesday. ""If policy is tight, inflation is falling, and growth is lacklustre, then interest rates are going to come down. The hard part is anticipating when,"" he added. There is a general consensus that rate-setters could trim rates as soon as December, and will cut again over the coming year in response to expected cooling inflation — the rate of which remained unchanged for the third consecutive month in September, at 3.8% — and a softening of labor market data. Most MPC members are more concerned about the implications of cutting rates too quickly rather than too slowly, Oxford Economics noted in analysis, and the BOE will want to see evidence of sustained downside surprises in the data and pay growth slowing to a target-consistent pace before voting to cut again. ""If we are right and the BOE pauses [this] week, the question will then turn to when the next cut will come,"" Allan Monks, chief U.K. economist at JP Morgan, said in a note. ""We have argued that further downside surprises in the inflation and labour market data will determine that. For example, a move up in the unemployment rate to 4.9% in September could be significant, as well as further soft sequential gains in core CPI services and private pay."" The fact the central bank's meeting this month came ahead of the upcoming Autumn Budget on Nov. 26 was another reason for the BOE's policy makers to pause for thought. It's widely expected that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce tax rises as she looks to fill a fiscal black hole estimated to be anywhere between £20-50 billion ($20-$65.2 billion), based on assumed forecasts of lower productivity, servicing debt and the cost of U-turns on welfare spending cuts, among other things. Earlier this week Reeves gave a clearer indication that tax rises are coming and is she is expected to consider increasing income tax as one way to raise revenues, but she has not given any further detail. Tax rises would likely act as another damper on inflation by reducing consumer demand. ""If the measures [in the budget] include a hike in income tax, they would add to the drag on households' real incomes from high inflation and slowing pay growth. As these factors weigh on demand inflation will likely ease,"" Andrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg, said in a note Friday. ""If so, this will allow the Bank of England to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at least twice next year to 3.50%. A front-loaded fiscal tightening would open the door to a third cut in 2026, to 3.25%,"" he added. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"Op-ed: The fuel for the AI boom is advertising. It is also an existential risk.","With OpenAI's recent release of its AI browser, the historic level of capital expenditures being made in the current AI arms race may accelerate even further, if that is possible. From the reciprocal, and some have said circular, nature of hundreds of billions in commitments in investment, tied to future chip purchases, to the extent to which GDP growth is reliant on this boom, some have said this is a bubble. A Harvard economist estimates 92% of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was due to investment in AI. But at the same time, the latest wave of AI has the potential to disrupt the very same trillions in market cap that is fueling it. AI will, without question, change how people search (Google), shop (Amazon) and are entertained (Meta). Answers delivered without clicking around the web. AI-assisted shopping. Infinite personalized content creation. If AI represents such a potential existential risk, why are Google, Meta and Amazon such a huge part of the current arms race to invest in AI? The ""moonshot"" outcome of would be that achieving Artificial General Intelligence, or Super Intelligence, AI that can do anything a human can, but better, would unlock so much value that it would dwarf any investment. But there is more immediate urgency to protect, or disrupt, the advertising business model fueling the trillions in market cap and hundreds of billions of current investment, before someone else does. While the seminal paper that launched this phase of AI, ""Attention is All You Need"" was written by mostly Google researchers, it was OpenAI and Microsoft, and now Grok as well, that launched the current AI arms race. And they are not remotely as dependent on the current advertising industrial complex. In fact, Sam Altman has called the feeds of the major platforms using AI to maximize advertising dollars, ""the first at-scale misaligned AIs."" He is clearly stating which businesses he believes OpenAI is trying to disrupt. This time is different, but it also comes with different risks. The major difference with the current fever in infrastructure investment vs the dotcom bubble of 2000, is that in large part the companies funding it are among the most profitable companies in the world. And so far, there has not been indications of cracks in the business model of advertising that is both funding their investments, and their market capitalizations (along with so many massive companies people wouldn't think about being in the advertising business). But if AI does disrupt, or even break, the current advertising model, the shock to the economy and markets would be far greater than most could imagine. Google, Meta and Amazon are still best positioned to create new business models, and as mentioned, have been using AI for far longer to support their advertising business models with great success. However, fundamentally changing the way people interface with search, commerce and content online will require just that, entirely new revenue models, maybe, hopefully, some that are aligned, that are not advertising based. But whatever the model, perhaps it is helpful to consider that the justification in AI infrastructure spending may not be to just unlock new revenue, but to protect the business models that make up a much more significant portion of the market capitalization of public companies than most people are aware.

"Private payrolls posted gain of 42,000 in October, higher than expected, ADP says","Payroll growth at private companies turned slightly stronger than expected in October, providing some hope that the labor market isn't in danger of sinking, ADP reported Wednesday. Companies added 42,000 jobs for the month, following a decline of 29,000 in September and topping the Dow Jones consensus estimate for a gain of 22,000. A revision for September showed 3,000 fewer jobs lost, the payrolls processing firm said. A gain of 47,000 in the trade, transportation and utilities grouping helped offset losses in multiple other categories. Education and health services also showed growth of 26,000, while financial activities added 11,000. Despite the artificial intelligence-fueled tech boom, information services saw a decline of 17,000 positions. Other sectors posting losses included professional and business services (-15,000), other services (-13,000), and manufacturing (-3,000), a sector that continues to struggle despite President Donald Trump's tariffs aimed at bringing factory jobs back to the U.S. All of the job creation came from companies employing at least 250 workers. That category added 76,000 jobs, while smaller businesses lost 34,000. The trend away from job growth at small businesses is significant, considering they are responsible for three of every four jobs, ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. ""While big companies make headlines, small companies drive hiring,"" Richardson said on CNBC. ""So to see that weakness at the small company level is still a concern, and I think that's one of the reasons why the recovery has been so tepid."" Despite the meager job growth, salaries continued to rise. Year-over-year pay for those staying in their jobs rose 4.5%, the same as in September, while job switchers saw a 6.7% increase, up slightly from a month ago. ""Private employers added jobs in October for the first time since July, but hiring was modest relative to what we reported earlier this year,"" Richardson said. ""Meanwhile, pay growth has been largely flat for more than a year, indicating that shifts in supply and demand are balanced."" The ADP count comes out the first Wednesday of the month and usually takes a back seat to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' official nonfarm payrolls report released two days later. However, because of the history-making government shutdown, the BLS, like all other government agencies, has suspended data collection and releases. Had the BLS report been released, Wall Street was looking for it to show a drop of 60,000 jobs and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5%. Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern over the state of the labor market, saying it has overtaken for now the central bank's attention toward inflation running above the 2% target. The Fed at its meeting last week approved a quarter percentage point reduction in its key interest rate, which now is targeted between 3.75%-4%. Though the BLS has gone dark, officials will get a look at other data this week. Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday releases its monthly look at announced layoffs, while economists will watch state-level jobless claims for a look at whether companies are shrinking payrolls. The University of Michigan on Friday also will release its monthly sentiment index which provides snapshots of how consumers feel about broader economic conditions.

"Job openings in October slumped to lowest since February 2021, Indeed says","Employment opportunities hit their lowest level in more than 4½ years as October came to a close and the government shutdown dragged on, according to data from jobs site Indeed. The firm's Job Postings Index fell to 101.9 as of Oct. 24, the most recent point for which data is available. That's the lowest since early February 2021 for a measure that uses February 2020 as a baseline value of 100. The level represents a 0.5% decline from the beginning of the month and a roughly 3.5% tumble from mid-August, the latest point from which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available. Under normal conditions, the BLS on Tuesday would have reported its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a measure that Federal Reserve officials watch closely for indications of slack in the jobs market. With the shutdown on the precipice of being the longest in history, economists and policymakers are left to look at alternative data for big-picture indicators. The most recent JOLTS report, for August, also indicated an ongoing decline in openings. The BLS reported that job openings totaled 7.23 million, about level with July but down 7% from January. Indeed's dashboard of indicators also has shown a pullback in salary offerings as job advertisements have declined. Year-over-year wages as judged by salary offerings in Indeed postings rose 2.5% in August, down from 3.4% in January. A softening labor market has generated concern from Fed officials. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee last week voted 10-2 to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%. Officials have cited rising risks to the labor market taking precedence over ongoing concerns about inflation holding nearly a full percentage point above the Fed's 2% target. ""Hiring is slowing. We see this from Indeed, from job postings,"" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said Monday. ""We're looking at a panoply of data, and those are real time. We're not waiting on the unemployment report. There's reason to be concerned, because there's a slight uptick in the unemployment rate over the summer."" The nonfarm payrolls report normally would be released Friday, but that also is not happening. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the BLS count would have shown a decline of 60,000 jobs in October and an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.5%. Got a confidential news tip?

"Bessent says U.S. has 'lots' of options to use on tariffs if it loses Supreme Court case","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that there are other options in case of defeat as the Supreme Court is about to hear a landmark case on President Donald Trump's tariffs. The high court is set Wednesday to hear arguments on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact sweeping duties on U.S. trading partners. At stake is the leeway presidents have to wield over trade measures as a tool of economic policy. Bessent expressed confidence in a CNBC ""Squawk Box"" interview that the administration will prevail, but has additional outlets it can use in case the decision goes the other way. ""There are lots of other authorities that can be used, but IEEPA is by far the cleanest, and it gives the U.S. and the president the most negotiating authority,"" he said. ""The others are more cumbersome, but they can be effective."" Specifically, Bessent cited Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which provides a justification on grounds of national security, as well as Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which regulates unfair trading practices. However, they would limit the president's ability to use tariffs, as Trump has, under ""emergency"" grounds. ""This is very important tomorrow, and SCOTUS is going to hear this,"" Bessent said, referring to the court's nickname. ""This is a signature policy for the president, and traditionally, SCOTUS has been loath to interfere with these signature policies."" Outside of the court case, the secretary talked up the relationship the White House has with China, following last week's meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. An agreement reached at the gathering in South Korea resulted in deals that set back some of the most onerous tariffs the two sides had slapped on each other. ""It was a very good meeting. Both sides approached it with great respect,"" Bessent said. ""I think President Trump is the only leader who President Xi respects. ... The relationship is in a good place.""

"AI-washing and the massive layoffs hitting the economy","Corporate America is getting rocked by historic rounds of white-collar layoffs, leading some to wonder: Has AI finally come for their jobs? While the proliferation of generative and agentic artificial intelligence is playing a role, recent job cut announcements from companies like Amazon, UPS and Target are about a lot more than just the advance of new technology. The firms, which each announced layoffs in recent weeks totaling more than 60,000 roles eliminated this year, said they're trying to cut corporate bloat, streamline operations and adjust to new business models. But in the absence of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report, which has gone dark amid the government shutdown, the layoff announcements have raised questions about the strength of the labor market and if it's the start of an AI-driven, white-collar recession. Some companies have outright said they're replacing workers with AI. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in May the company was able to shrink its head count by about 40%, in part because of AI. Duolingo said in April it'll stop using contractors for work that AI can handle. Salesforce laid off 4,000 customer support roles in September, saying that AI can do 50% of the work at the company. But experts interviewed by CNBC said some companies could be ""AI-washing"" their job cuts, blaming layoffs on the new technology to cover up business fumbles and old-fashioned cost cutting. ""We spend a lot of time looking carefully at companies that are actually trying to implement AI, and there's very little evidence that it cuts jobs anywhere near like the level that we're talking about. In most cases, it doesn't cut head count at all,"" said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School and director of its Center for Human Resources. ""Using AI and introducing it to save jobs turns out to be an enormously complicated and time-consuming exercise. … There's still a perception that it's simple and easy and cheap to do, and it's really not."" Still, the cuts, which come after a string of layoffs across the tech industry, have cast a dark cloud on a teetering economy that's been wracked by persistent inflation, rising delinquencies, falling consumer sentiment and an average effective tariff rate that's at its highest level in nearly a century, according to estimates from The Budget Lab at Yale University. The growing pile of bad news has done little to shock the stock market, which is at near-record highs, but that's largely because it's been buoyed in part by AI megacaps. Cappelli attributed the recent surge in layoff announcements to concerns about the state of the economy. He also noted a likely ""bandwagon"" effect in which companies see their competitors cutting so they too start making cuts. ""If it looks like everybody is cutting, then you say, 'They must know something we don't know,'"" said Cappelli. He added investors often reward cutting: ""They want to hear that you're cutting because it looks like you're doing something good. It looks like becoming more efficient."" To be sure, AI and automation are potentially enabling some of the cuts, and the emerging technology is poised to help all companies reduce costs and boost efficiency in the coming years. But the reasons behind each layoff and the role AI is playing are nuanced, and vary company by company. Starbucks' decision to cut around 2,000 corporate jobs in two rounds this year is related to slowing sales at the company and a larger turnaround effort led by its new CEO, Brian Niccol. Layoffs at Meta's AI unit, which impacted around 600 jobs, came as the company said it wants to operate more nimbly and reduce layers. Intel's decision to lay off about 15% of its workforce came after it overinvested in chip manufacturing without adequate demand. Together, they represent what John Challenger, CEO of job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, described as a turning point in the economy and job market. ""We were in this no-hire, no-fire, type of zone. Economy was moving ahead. The labor markets were feeling pressure, but certainly, unemployment had stayed relatively strong,"" he said. ""These job cuts do suggest that the dam may be breaking as the economy slows."" The earliest signals, he said, could be coming from retail, shipping and distribution. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon went on a hiring spree in part to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services, leading its corporate and front-line workforces to more than double to 1.3 million employees between 2019 and 2020. By 2021, the company had swelled to 1.6 million employees globally, the same year Andy Jassy succeeded Jeff Bezos as CEO. Since taking over, Jassy has been trying to undo some of that work. Last week's layoff announcement, impacting 14,000 corporate jobs, is expected to be the largest in the company's history and to affect nearly every unit in the company. It marks Amazon's second round of layoffs in three years and amounts to more than 41,000 corporate job cuts since 2022, with more potentially on the way come 2026. Though AI is part of the picture, there's more at work behind the reductions. Jassy said in the days following the announcement that the changes were neither AI nor financially driven, but were instead to cut corporate fat so the company can operate as the world's largest startup. Amazon said it's not replacing workers with AI, at least not yet, but it does need to cut employees so it can invest in the technology. As those costs come down, Amazon has earmarked hefty investments in cloud infrastructure to support AI workloads while simultaneously pushing out a flurry of AI services and tools across the company. It's contributed to a rise in capital expenditures, which are now expected to reach $125 billion this year, up from a prior forecast of $118 billion. Jassy said previously that the company's workforce would shrink in the future as a result of its embrace of generative AI but it still plans to keep hiring in ""key strategic areas."" Over time, the company will need ""fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today"" but ""more people doing other types of jobs,"" Jassy said in June. The cuts are also part of a larger goal of Jassy's to make the company more nimble, reduce bureaucracy and remove layers so it can operate faster and smarter. ""It's culture,"" Jassy said during Amazon's quarterly earnings call Thursday. ""If you grow as fast as we did for several years, you know, the size of the businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers."" In January, UPS announced a major change in its strategy. The logistics firm said it was going to pare down its relationship with its largest customer, Amazon, in favor of higher-margin businesses that require fewer people to operate. In fiscal 2024, Amazon shipments represented nearly 12% of revenue for UPS. The logistics giant said it was planning to reduce that volume by more than half by June because of the relatively low margins. ""This was not their ask. This was us. This was UPS taking control of our destiny,"" CEO Carol Tomé told analysts in January. In turn, UPS said it was pivoting to more profitable businesses, like health care, returns and business-to-business services and as a result, would require fewer resources. ""As we bring volume down, we will not only reduce the hours of miles associated with this volume, we will be able to take out fixed costs to match our capacity to our new expected volume levels,"" finance chief Brian Dykes said in January. ""We expect to close up to 10% of our building, cut back our vehicle and aircraft fleets and reduce labor."" Last week the company said it had deepened previously planned job cuts for a total of 48,000 roles eliminated so far this year across operational employees and office workers. In the first half of 2025, parcel volumes were down 5.4% at UPS compared with the year-ago period, according to data from ShipMatrix, and the company has been changing its corporate structure to adjust to lower volume. The bulk of its layoffs this year, representing 34,000 operational jobs, were related to its decision to close 93 buildings – not replace people with robotics, the company said. The 14,000 additional corporate roles it cut were partially related to AI, but the technology was not the primary driver, a spokesperson said. Where AI and automation are expected to hit UPS most is in its future hiring plans. As the company plans to bring automation to more of its facilities, it won't need to hire as many people. Last week, UPS said 66% of its volume during the fourth quarter would come through automated facilities, up from 63% a year prior. That number is expected to move higher in the years ahead. Still, that doesn't necessarily mean those jobs are disappearing – some could be migrating from UPS to other companies, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University's business school. Miller said there's a ""reallocation"" effect happening where one firm is losing business and shedding payroll — while another is gaining. The number of jobs may be the same, but the location, qualities and duties can differ, he said. BLS data on the number of people employed in ""courier"" positions, which covers roles at places like UPS and Amazon, reflects that trend. As of August, courier positions were only down about 2% from their all-time high, and they've been on the rise over the last three years, the data shows. Target's announcement last month that it would be cutting 1,800 jobs, representing about 8% of its corporate workforce, is a window into both consumer spending and the retailer's own specific challenges. It's Target's first major round of layoffs in a decade and comes after four years of roughly stagnant revenue. The retailer's incoming CEO, Michael Fiddelke, said the cuts are about reducing complexity at a company that's seen its workforce grow faster than sales. Unlike some of its competitors, the bulk of Target's revenue comes from the kinds of products that are nice to have, but not necessary, such as holiday mugs, trendy sweaters and home decor. That means when consumer spending starts to slow down, Target feels it more acutely than its rival Walmart, which earns the majority of its revenue from groceries. Slower consumer spending has been partially to blame for a decline in Target's performance in recent years, but the introduction of tariffs, which are pushing prices higher, could make that impact even worse. ""Buyers' willingness to pay is staying flat, inflation is high, income isn't going very up so firms' ability to sort of increase price to maintain their margin is being squeezed,"" said Daniel Keum, an associate professor of management at Columbia Business School, who studies labor market dynamics. ""If you can't increase price, you have to reduce cost. ""How operationally do I manage cost?"" Keum added. ""I mean No. 1, like, let's lay off white-collar people."" Outside of macroeconomic conditions, Target's business has also suffered from a number of self-inflicted challenges. The quality of its merchandise has taken a dive, fewer staff and frequent out-of-stocks have made its stores less enjoyable to shop in, customers and insiders told CNBC earlier this year. The retailer has also struggled to manage its inventory, which has impacted its profitability. All of these issues combined have left Target with a workforce that has grown faster than sales and a complex corporate structure that has hampered decision-making and created needless red tape. Between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, Target's global workforce grew 6% from 415,000 employees to 440,000, but in the same time period, sales declined 0.8%, according to company filings. ""The truth is, the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back,"" Fiddelke told Target employees in a memo when announcing the job cuts. ""Too many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life."" He didn't cite AI in his memo but did say the cuts will help the company execute faster so it can better ""accelerate technology."" — CNBC's Melissa Repko and Steve Liesman contributed to this report.

"Russia looks to cosy up with China after Trump’s meeting with Xi","Russian officials appeared eager Monday to reaffiirm Moscow's alliance with China following U.S. President Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Xi Jinping. Hot on the heels of Trump's talks with Xi last week, which the U.S. president described as ""amazing,"" Russia has now sent a large delegation of its own to China for deal-making and talks. Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin arrived in Hangzhou on Monday for two-day talks with his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang, with the officials signing a range of agreements, Russian state media reported, to deepen cooperation in the fields of trade, investment, energy, transport, agriculture and space. Calling his Chinese counterpart his ""dear friend,"" Mishustin said in comments reported by Russian state news agency Ria Novosti, that relations between Russia and China were ""at their highest level in their centuries-long history and continue to develop dynamically in all areas, despite various obstacles and illegal Western sanctions."" For his part, Li Qiang said Beijing was ready to strengthen cooperation with Russia despite obstacles, although he did not specify what he was referring to. ""Despite new external risks and challenges in this process, China and Russia always support each other, build strategic contacts and interactions, and strive to jointly overcome difficulties,"" he said, TASS reported. He added that the partnership ""demonstrates that China and Russia are good neighbors and reliable partners who can always trust each other."" China is Russia's most important and powerful international ally, with Beijing having refused to condemn Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the ongoing war, echoing Russia's rhetoric by calling the war a ""crisis."" Just ahead of its invasion of Ukraine, Putin and Xi signed a ""no limits"" partnership and Russia has looked to leverage that alliance both in terms of geopolitical support and trade partnerships, to lessen the impact of Western sanctions which have curtailed its energy export market. Ahead of this week's trip, the Kremlin said it placed ""very great"" importance on the talks and it has certainly looked to reflect that in the delegation sent to Asia, with Mishustin accompanied by a range of top officials including his deputies and ministers of finance, agriculture, transport, economic development and trade. Space and nuclear energy officials were also in tow, with the director general of Roscosmos and head of Rosatom joining the delegation. Russian officials' two-day visit to China comes just days after Trump's high-profile meeting with Chinese President Xi last week in which he said the leaders had reached ""agreement on many issues."" Xi, meanwhile, said Beijing and Washington should be ""partners and friends."" In what was widely seen as a ""trade truce"" after months of escalating tensions over tariffs and counter-tariffs, Trump said he reached a 1-year agreement with China on rare earth supplies and he also cut fentanyl-linked tariffs on Beijing by half, taking overall duties on Chinese goods down to 47%. Moscow did not publicly comment on the meeting and was likely uncomfortable at the sight of its longtime ally China holding seemingly constructive (and reconstructive) talks with the U.S., with whom it has seen a sharp deterioration of relations in recent weeks. Trump pulled out of in-person talks that were due to take place with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he did not want to ""have a wasted meeting,"" signaling his frustration with Moscow over a lack of movement on the Ukraine war. Trump added that the summit had been canceled because ""every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere."" Russia was non-plussed by the cancelation, with senior Russian officials blaming Western media and ""fake news"" for the jettisoned talks. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"Tariffs are expected to show up more in prices as holiday shopping season starts","While the impact so far this year has been muted, tariffs are expected to catch up with prices consumers pay just in time for the holiday shopping season. President Donald Trump's tariffs on a plethora of items and individual countries, which started in April, have coincided with common inflation measures trudging along between 2.5% and 3% this year. While economists don't see a major spike coming in common measures such as the consumer price and the personal consumption price indexes, they expect the tariffs will keep those gauges elevated at a time when they otherwise would be moving lower. ""There have been some questions in recent months as to whether tariffs have led to higher inflation for consumers,"" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. ""We think there's no debate — tariffs have pushed consumer prices higher."" Tariff impacts have been muted so far as companies built up inventories ahead of the duties and absorbed some of the impact through compressed profit margins. Bank of America, though, expects that tariffs will be adding about half a percentage point to the core PCE measure the Federal Reserve uses when assessing inflation. With tariffs, BofA estimates that the inflation rate would be 2.9% in September, so without them that would mean a measure closer to 2.4%. The numbers are similar to ones Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited Wednesday. The core PCE on an annual basis was 2.9% in August. These percentage point differences matter to the Fed, which tries to keep core inflation, excluding food and energy, at 2%, a level it has been above since March 2021. Two Fed officials — regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City and Lorie Logan of Dallas — said Friday they did not agree with their colleagues' decision Wednesday to lower the central bank's key interest rate. For consumers, they also matter. Bhave estimates that shoppers are bearing about 50%-70% of total tariff costs, with businesses bearing the rest. In real-world terms, that's meant higher prices for things such as coffee, furniture and, recently, clothing prices, which jumped 0.7% in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even though they are minor components of the price indexes, they are items consumers buy frequently and can create perceptions about inflation, which can produce a self-reinforcing cycle that drives prices higher. ""Inflation in certain goods can have an outsized impact on consumer confidence, even if those items carry a negligible weight in the CPI basket,"" TD Cowen analysts said in a note. Price increases in items such as eggs create ""a constant, tangible feedback loop every week at the grocery store. Such items shape perception more than their statistical significance would suggest."" The firm noted that this holiday season could see more of that sort of thing as artificial Christmas trees are almost all imported from China, which faces heavy costs under the Trump tariffs. ""While Artificial Christmas trees are not unique, they serve as a clear example of how high-tariff, seasonal goods can shape consumer perceptions of inflation,"" Cowen said. Had the duties been in place during the 2024 holiday season, shoppers would have spent an additional $40.6 billion, according to LendingTree estimates using data from multiple government and private sources. LendingTree's Budget Lab further estimates that some 70.5% of new tariffs were passed onto consumers in June 2025. ""That means that even more Americans would have had to fall back on credit cards and personal loans to help cover gift-buying expenses,"" said Matt Schultz, the firm's chief consumer finance analyst. ""That's the unfortunate reality that many people would have faced."" Using the same estimates, LendingTree said the tariff cost comes to $132 per shopper. Got a confidential news tip?
