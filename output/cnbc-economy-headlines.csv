"Atlanta Fed President Bostic says he'll leave position when his term expires in February","Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he will be leaving his position when his term expires in February. Bostic has been in his current role since June 2017 and is the first Black and openly gay regional president. His term, which also was marked by issues relating to personal investments he made, runs until Feb. 28. ""I'm proud of what we accomplished during my tenure to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality, and I look forward to discovering new ways to advance that bold vision in my next chapter,"" Bostic said in a statement. The announcement comes ahead of a pivotal year for the Fed and its rate-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee. Regional presidents serve five-year terms that generally run in sync and are designed to expire on years that end in either 1 or 6, which will be the case next year. While the local boards vote on the presidents, they are subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. Normally a routine process, unusual political dynamics on the board could add a new wrinkle to the procedure. In addition to the reappointments of the regional presidents, Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, though his run as governor goes until 2028. Bostic has been seen as more of a centrist during his run, though he's been more cautious about cutting interest rates this year during a time of elevated inflation and a softening labor market. He is not an FOMC voter this year. Atlanta next will get a vote in 2027. Powell said Bostic's ""perspective has enriched the Federal Open Market Committee's understanding of our dynamic economy. And his steady voice has exemplified the best of public service — grounded in analysis, informed by experience, and guided by purpose."" Until the board names a successor, Cheryl Venable, the first vice president and chief operating officer at the Atlanta Fed, will handle the role of president. Bostic's term has not been without controversy. In October 2022, the Fed announced it was looking at trades Bostic made during blackout periods near policy meetings. An internal report showed there were 154 trades made on his behalf during those times. However, the report also indicated there was no evidence Bostic traded on insider information or had personal conflicts. There also were other issues raised regarding financial disclosure terms and an improper level of Treasury holdings. For his part, Bostic expressed regret over the discrepancies and said the trades were executed by third-party managers over whom he did not have control. The controversy was part of a larger issue with investments from Fed officials that triggered tighter internal controls and rules over what types of securities they are permitted to hold.

"The shutdown put jobs and inflation data on hold. Here's when it could be back","Economic data releases that have lagged during the government shutdown likely will take some time to get rolling again once Congress is back in business. The reopening could happen as soon as the end of this week once final votes take place and President Donald Trump signs a stop-gap spending bill into law. From there, though, it will take the various agencies, primarily in the departments of Labor and Commerce, to get up and rolling again as it regards data collection and releases. That means likely having to play catch-up for key reports like nonfarm payrolls, the consumer price index, retail sales, spending and income, and a variety of other metrics. ""The shutdown of the federal government has delayed nearly all federal economic data releases for September and October,"" Goldman Sachs economists Elsie Peng and Ronnie Walker said in a client note. ""While the shutdown appears to be nearing its end, it will take time for the statistical agencies to work through the backlog of releases."" Assuming the government reopens before the end of the week, Goldman figures the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will put out an updated schedule of releases in the early part of next week. The BLS is in charge of the payrolls report as well as the CPI and the producer price index, both of which were scheduled for release this week. Other reports from the bureau include import and export prices, the employment cost index, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Goldman's economists expect the October jobs report to be released soon after the reopening, possibly next Tuesday or Wednesday. ""But apart from that, we expect other major data releases to be delayed,"" they said. That means the November payrolls and inflation reports could be delayed by ""at least a week,"" Goldman said. For Commerce, among the more relevant reports are personal spending and income, which also includes the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Outside of that, there's retail sales, durable goods and the quarterly gross domestic product reading. When the data freeze ends, the reports are likely to show more of the same as far as the economy goes — a slowing labor market, inflation still holding above the Fed's comfort level and broader growth positive but also not gangbusters. Fed officials have noted the inconvenience of not having regular data reports. But Chair Jerome Powell said recently that alternative data shows the central bank really hasn't missed much in terms of the macro picture. ""Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public- and private-sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,"" Powell said at an Oct. 29 news conference. ""Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated."" Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting the October nonfarm payrolls report to show a loss of 60,000 jobs. While Goldman puts the decline at 50,000, the general tenor of data for the month points to a slowdown. Powell said Fed estimates put the key inflation rate at 2.8% for September, which is still considerably above the central bank's 2% target but expected to decelerate gradually through 2026. The official PCE report is scheduled to drop Nov. 26, and it is unknown whether that will be the case. As for the broader economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker of incoming data puts third-quarter growth at a 4% rate. Goldman projects fourth-quarter growth of 1.3%, an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point from the prior forecast, putting the full year on pace for a 2% annualized gain.

"'Ghost job' postings add another layer of uncertainty to stalled jobs picture","Judging by current data, you'd think there's literally a job out there for anyone who wants one. Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story. The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers. But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled. Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. That points to an ongoing problem with ""ghost jobs"" that never seem to get filled. ""The U.S. labor market looks deceptively strong on paper. Millions of openings suggest opportunity, but many are illusions,"" said Jasmine Escalera, career expert at MyPerfectResume, an employment assistance platform that released a report this week on the shadow employment market. ""The ghost job economy inflates hope, wastes job seekers' time and clouds the data [that] policymakers rely on to steer the economy."" Job openings have generally been on the decline since peaking above 12 million in March 2022, when opportunities outnumbered available workers by better than 2 to 1. In August, the latest month for which data is available because of the government shutdown, openings totaled more than 7.2 million while hires were just 5.1 million. The ratio of vacancies to workers was about even. To be sure, the picture isn't as simple as comparing the two numbers. The postings number represents the total stock of jobs, while hirings are the flow of people hired during a particular month. So a job can get posted across multiple months without being filled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the companies advertising those positions don't intend to hire someone. Moreover, some companies will post jobs just to keep an inventory of potential workers for positions that may open in the future. Finally, the openings-to-hire ratio has fallen over the past few years, from 1.8 to 1 at the peak of the job opening cycle to the current level around 1.4 to 1, indicating fewer ""ghost jobs"" out there. One issue affecting the gap: the changing labor pool as the U.S. has tightened its immigration standards. Small business owners report the toughest time filling open positions since the Covid pandemic while noting that 88% of applicants for jobs lack the required skills, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report Tuesday. However, the issue has drawn more serious attention in recent months as the labor market has begun moderating and net hiring has slowed to a crawl. At the same time, official government data is unavailable due to the shutdown in Washington, D.C. Job seekers have become frustrated at not being able to find new positions. Mobility has decelerated, with the ""quits rate"" falling more than 30% from that March 2022 peak of job openings, during what was called the ""Great Resignation."" A petition on Change.org seeking to clamp down on companies advertising ghost jobs has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures. There are real impacts on a policy level: Federal Reserve officials watch BLS job openings numbers closely for clues about how tight the labor market is, so having unreliable data clouds their vision. ""For job seekers, that means wasted time. For policymakers, it means distorted data. For employers, it raises serious credibility issues,"" Escalera said. ""Until postings more accurately reflect actual hiring, workers will continue to chase jobs that don't exist, and trust in the labor market will erode."" Got a confidential news tip?

"Stocks are buoying wealthy economic sentiment. A labor market break could end that","As stock market investors support economic sentiment, some economists wonder if a looser labor market could pull the rug out. The University of Michigan's widely-followed consumer sentiment index slid more than 6% in November, nearing all-time lows and down about 30% from a year ago. Respondents were concerned that the long-running federal government shutdown would drag on the economy, according to survey director Joanne Hsu. But at least one group bucked the sour mood: Those with the most stock holdings. The individuals with sizable stock market wealth reported an 11% improvement in sentiment, which Hsu tied to the stock market's recent rally to all-time highs. Conventional wisdom is that wealthier consumers will keep spending as long as they feel good about their own circumstances and see their investments growing, bolstering the economy and corporate profits. But now other economists are concerned that federal labor data, once it resumes, may paint a darker picture of the economy and catalyze a market sell-off that would throw cold water on rosy outlooks. ""It comes down to the labor market,"" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust. ""If you start getting negative job prints, the jig is up."" Economists told CNBC that the stock market is behaving as if the economy is ""K""-shaped, with the best-off thriving while the lower end struggles. Investors are counting on the higher-end of the ""K"" continuing to fare well and spending part of their discretionary income. The group's resilience even in the face of high tariffs this year and the brief April swoon in stocks has eased concern about the likelihood of the economy tipping into a recession anytime soon. RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas, for example, said that while he doesn't expect top end consumers to crack and cause a recession, the Michigan survey data underscores ""severe market stress"" on lower-end consumers that don't own stocks and aren't benefiting from the artificial intelligence trade. ""Elevated equity valuations partially mask the ongoing structural transformation of the economy down market — that does not favor those who work in traditional industries,"" Brusuelas said. ""It points to [a] very highly segmented economy with different realities based on which economic decile you live in."" In other words, how much money you make and how many investments you hold. The best-off consumers also likely benefit from rising home prices on their properties and, in many instances, low mortgage rates obtained during the Covid pandemic, according to Jeffrey Roach, LPL Financial's chief economist. That is yet another cause for optimism in this group — even if this year's stock market rally loses steam, he said. The benchmark S&P 500 has climbed more than 16% in 2025, excluding dividends, and is on track for its third straight winning year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped nearly 22%, underscoring continued excitement around AI. Roach said the expected business benefits from President Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" justify some market froth, and the promise of profits from AI can lure investors into buying stocks with high valuations. How long the economy will continue to depend on the top cohort of consumers may come down to the state of the labor market, Roach said. With less immigration under the Trump administration, it may become easier to return to the workforce, as long as demand holds up. That in turn can drive up household incomes and help the economy sidestep a possible recession down the road, Roach added. But Tilley of M&T Bank and Wilmington Trust said warning signs are flashing. Among them, data showing small businesses shrinking payrolls. Even before the government shutdown suspended the latest jobs reports, it seemed like nonfarm payrolls were showing signs of weakness. If employment softens, it will be harder for investors to bank on the top end of the ""K""-shaped economy holding firm. The idea that wealthy consumers can single-handedly prop up demand feels ""reverse engineered"" to rationalize why the stock market has jumped to records despite uncertainty in the job market, said Tilley, an economic adviser to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve for almost six years before joining Wilmington Trust. ""History shows: You start getting negative job prints, the economy and the market are going to come right after that,"" Tilley said. ""We're 100% focused on the labor market, and we see a lot of chinks in the armor there."" Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"Nexperia parent shares jump 6% as Beijing signals thaw in tensions with Netherlands","Shares of Wingtech Technology, parent company of chipmaker Nexperia, extended gains on Monday after Beijing agreed to further talks with a Dutch delegation, easing concerns about a global auto supply crunch. Shanghai-listed Wingtech Technology saw its shares jump as much as 6.4% on Monday, according to LSEG data, after surging 9.7% in the final minutes of trading last Friday on signs of de-escalation in a battle over control of the Dutch-based Nexperia. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had taken steps to allow exports of certain chips from Nexperia's China facility, while urging the European Union to press the Dutch government to lift restrictions on the firm. In a separate statement on Saturday, Beijing said that it has agreed to the Dutch government's request to send representatives to Beijing for talks, and that it hoped the Netherlands would propose ""constructive solutions"" and take ""concrete actions"" to resolve the dispute over Nexperia soon. The move followed a statement from Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans last Thursday, which suggested Nexperia chips would reach customers in Europe and beyond in the coming days, citing ""the constructive nature of our talks with the Chinese authorities."" China and the U.S. had informed the Netherlands that the trade deal they struck last month would result in the resumption of supplies from Nexperia's facilities in China, Karremans said. ""This is also consistent with information provided by the European Commission by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,"" he added. The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia on Sept. 30, citing security concerns that the company would shift its operations to China, where its parent company Wingtech is based, prompting Beijing to retaliate by blocking exports of components from Nexperia's Chinese facility. The dispute over the ownership and control of the Dutch-based Nexperia led to worries of a global shortage of the chips widely used in industrial, computing, mobile and consumer products. Carmakers like Volkswagen warned of possible production risks, while Honda slashed its annual profit forecast after halting production at several plants. Other major automakers, including Stellantis, said they were monitoring the situation around the clock, setting up ""war rooms"" to explore alternative purchasing methods to mitigate disruptions. The recent escalation of the dispute over Nexperia was the ""direct result"" of Beijing's simmering tensions with the U.S., said Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI. Washington in late September expanded its entity list — a U.S. trade blacklist for companies seen as security or foreign policy risks — to include subsidiaries that are 50% or more owned by firms already on the list. Nexperia is one such subsidiary of Zhejiang-based communications equipment manufacturer Wingtech Technology Co., which was added to the list in December last year, Wang said. Following a trade truce struck between Beijing and Washington on Oct. 30, which led both sides to scale back some restrictions, China said earlier this month that it would allow Nexperia's China unit to resume shipments to global customers. ""Beijing appeared unwilling to gamble with bilateral relations [with the Netherlands],"" Evercore’s Neo said, as the stakes are high given that the Dutch government controls ASML Holding, the world's top supplier of advanced chipmaking equipment. Because of its unique technology, ASML has been a key focus of U.S.-China tensions, with Washington pressuring The Hague to restrict exports to China. Suppliers have begun receiving chip shipments from China, according to a note on Saturday from a team of auto and mobility analysts led by Dan Levy at Barclays. However, the analysts warned that low chip inventories could still cause disruptions in the near term. They added that the relief appeared ""temporary,"" as the core dispute between Nexperia's Dutch headquarters and its China-based operation remains unresolved. Got a confidential news tip?

"Consumer sentiment nears lowest level ever as worries build over shutdown","Worries over the government shutdown surged in the early part of November, pushing consumer sentiment to its lowest in more than three years and just off its worst level ever, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The university's monthly Index of Consumer Sentiment posted a reading of 50.3 for the month, indicating a decline of 6.2% on the month and about 30% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for 53.0 after October's 53.6. Sentiment was last this low in June 2022 as inflation hovered around its highest level in 40 years. November's reading was the second lowest going back to at least 1978. Concerns about the ongoing impasse in Washington topped consumers' fears, outweighing a boost in sentiment from fresh record highs in stock prices, said Joanne Hsu, survey director . ""With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,"" Hsu said. ""This month's decline in sentiment was widespread throughout the population, seen across age, income, and political affiliation."" Other measures in the survey painted a similar picture. The current conditions index slid to 52.3, a drop of nearly 11% from last month and the lowest in its history going back to 1951, while the future expectations measure fell to 49.0, down 2.6%. On a year-earlier basis, the two measures respectively slumped 18.2% and 36.3%. ""Across the economy, segments of the population are increasingly dealing with tighter financial conditions,"" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at consumer finance site NerdWallet. ""That's certainly true for federal workers and people dependent on food assistance from the federal government. But it's also likely increasingly true for middle income Americans."" Measures of inflation held relatively in check, with a drop in the longer-term outlook. The outlook for one year from now nudged higher to 4.7%, while the five-year measure was at 3.6%, down 0.3 percentage point. With government economic data collection and releases suspended during the shutdown, measures like the Michigan sentiment survey loom larger as alternative measures of economic progress. As has been the case with other measures, the survey found some disparity in income levels and particularly by asset holdings. Hsu said sentiment among those with the largest stock holdings actually improved 11%. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"Chicago Fed's Goolsbee says he's cautious about further rate cuts during shutdown","Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Thursday expressed hesitation about lowering interest rates further because the government shutdown has resulted in a blackout on key inflation data. While Goolsbee has otherwise been an advocate for gradually lowering rates, the central bank official said during a CNBC interview that he has concerns over the lack of important price reports, particularly with general inflation recently trending higher. ""If there are problems developing on the inflation side, it's going to be a fair amount bit of time before we see that, where if it starts to deteriorate on the job market side, we're going to see that pretty much right away,"" Goolsbee said. ""So that makes me even more uneasy ... with front-loading rate cuts and counting on the inflation that we have seen in the last three months to just be transitory and assume that they're going to go away."" Goolsbee spoke as the Chicago Fed updated its own dashboard of labor market indicators. The data set indicated a stable unemployment rate in October and a steady pace of hirings and layoffs. The Chicago Fed's unemployment rate indicator was at 4.36% for the month, up just one one-hundredth of a percentage point from September. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics won't release its consumer price index report for October, which had been scheduled for next week. The BLS did put out a report for September despite the shutdown, as that particular count is used for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. That report showed inflation running at a 3% annual rate, compared with the Fed's goal of 2%. Whether the Commerce Department releases its personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge, depends on getting the shutdown resolved. Goolsbee said the lack of inflation reports concerns him, as three-month trends before the shutdown showed core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, running at a 3.6% annualized pace. ""Medium-run, I'm not hawkish on rates. I believe that the settling point for rates is going to be a fair bit below where it is today,"" he said. ""When it's foggy, let's just be a little careful and slow down."" Goolsbee will get a vote when the Federal Open Market Committee meets in December to decide whether to cut rates again following reductions at the prior two meetings. However, he will rotate to being an alternate in 2026 before returning to a voting role in 2027. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"Job cuts in October hit highest level for the month in 22 years, Challenger says","Layoff announcements soared in October as companies recalibrated staffing levels during the artificial intelligence boom, a sign of potential trouble ahead for the labor market, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Job cuts for the month totaled 153,074, a 183% surge from September and 175% higher than the same month a year ago. It was the highest level for any October since 2003. This has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009. ""Like in 2003, a disruptive technology is changing the landscape,"" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at the firm. ""At a time when job creation is at its lowest point in years, the optics of announcing layoffs in the fourth quarter are particularly unfavorable."" The report provides a glimpse into the labor market at a time when the government has suspended data gathering and releases during the shutdown in Washington, D.C. To be sure, the Challenger monthly numbers can be highly volatile, and an accelerated pace of layoffs has yet to show up in state-level weekly jobless claim filings that continue to come in despite the shutdown. Payrolls processing firm ADP reported that October saw net job growth of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector. However, the report comes at a time when Federal Reserve officials have expressed concern about a softening labor market. The central bank has lowered its benchmark interest rate twice since September and is expected to approve another quarter percentage point reduction in December as policymakers look to get ahead of any more serious problems. Challenger reports the highest level of layoffs coming from the technology sector amid a time of restructuring due to AI integration. Companies in the sector announced 33,281 cuts, nearly six times the level in September. Consumer products also saw a sharp gain to 3,409, while nonprofits, an area hit hard by the shutdown, listed 27,651 cuts year to date, up 419% from the same point in 2024. In total, companies have announced 1.1 million cuts this year, a 65% increase from a year ago and the highest level since the Covid pandemic year of 2020. October saw the highest total for any month in the fourth quarter since 2008. ""Some industries are correcting after the hiring boom of the pandemic, but this comes as AI adoption, softening consumer and corporate spending, and rising costs drive belt-tightening and hiring freezes. Those laid off now are finding it harder to quickly secure new roles, which could further loosen the labor market,"" Challenger said. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"'We're past peak-restrictiveness,' BOE governor says, as bets rise on Christmas rate cut","LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday voted narrowly to hold interest rates steady, exercising caution ahead of the government's Autumn Budget in November. Out of the BOE's nine-member monetary policy committee, five members voted to hold the key interest rate, known as Bank Rate, at 4%, while four opted for a 25 basis point cut. The vote was slimmer than expected with economists polled by Reuters expecting a 6-3 split in favor of a hold. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey signaled to CNBC that rate cuts are coming, with economists now pricing in a pre-Christmas rate cut. ""We're past peak-restrictiveness, which is what you'd expect given that we've cut interest rates five times [since Aug.2024]. For my part, I feel policy is still restrictive, but it's past peak restriction,"" he told CNBC's Ritika Gupta. As for the timing of the next cut, Bailey said he would be watching inflation and labor market data that'll be released before the last monetary policy meeting of the year, on Dec.18. ""I'll certainly be looking at the rest of this year and the evidence we see between now and our last meeting,"" Bailey noted, adding that the MPC would also be able to incorporate Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget, due Nov.26, into the central bank's assessment. The central bank said in a statement that the inflation rate, at 3.8% in September, had likely peaked and that a disinflationary trend was underway. This was ""supported by the still restrictive stance of monetary policy,"" it said. ""This is reflected in an easing of pay growth and services price inflation. Underlying disinflation is being underpinned by subdued economic growth and building slack in the labour market,"" the bank added. The BOE cautioned that future rate cuts ""will therefore depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation. If progress on disinflation continues, Bank Rate is likely to continue on a gradual downward path."" ""I think this is the doves winning the argument,"" Victoria Clarke, U.K. chief economist at Santander CIB, told CNBC Thursday. ""[BOE Governor Andrew] Bailey has made it clear he wants a bit more data and that was certainly my judgement, that there is a lot of value in waiting for December. You've got two more CPI [inflation] prints coming and two more labor market prints and, of course, this massive budget,"" she told CNBC's Decision Time. Yields on U.K. government bonds fell across the board, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt shedding almost 3 basis points. Meanwhile the British pound trimmed earlier gains to trade 0.18% higher against the U.S. dollar. The meeting on Thursday was the last one before the Autumn Budget later this month. Economists had said that while they believed the central bank was more likely to hold rates steady, it was not a given. ""It's not a case of whether they will cut interest rates at some point — the answer to that is yes, we believe they will, ""Dean Turner, chief euro zone and U.K. Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office, had said Tuesday. ""If policy is tight, inflation is falling, and growth is lacklustre, then interest rates are going to come down. The hard part is anticipating when,"" he added. There is a general consensus that rate-setters could trim rates as soon as December, and will cut again over the coming year in response to expected cooling inflation — the rate of which remained unchanged for the third consecutive month in September, at 3.8% — and a softening of labor market data. Most MPC members are more concerned about the implications of cutting rates too quickly rather than too slowly, Oxford Economics noted in analysis, and the BOE will want to see evidence of sustained downside surprises in the data and pay growth slowing to a target-consistent pace before voting to cut again. ""If we are right and the BOE pauses [this] week, the question will then turn to when the next cut will come,"" Allan Monks, chief U.K. economist at JP Morgan, said in a note. ""We have argued that further downside surprises in the inflation and labour market data will determine that. For example, a move up in the unemployment rate to 4.9% in September could be significant, as well as further soft sequential gains in core CPI services and private pay."" The fact the central bank's meeting this month came ahead of the upcoming Autumn Budget on Nov. 26 was another reason for the BOE's policy makers to pause for thought. It's widely expected that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce tax rises as she looks to fill a fiscal black hole estimated to be anywhere between £20-50 billion ($20-$65.2 billion), based on assumed forecasts of lower productivity, servicing debt and the cost of U-turns on welfare spending cuts, among other things. Earlier this week Reeves gave a clearer indication that tax rises are coming and is she is expected to consider increasing income tax as one way to raise revenues, but she has not given any further detail. Tax rises would likely act as another damper on inflation by reducing consumer demand. ""If the measures [in the budget] include a hike in income tax, they would add to the drag on households' real incomes from high inflation and slowing pay growth. As these factors weigh on demand inflation will likely ease,"" Andrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg, said in a note Friday. ""If so, this will allow the Bank of England to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at least twice next year to 3.50%. A front-loaded fiscal tightening would open the door to a third cut in 2026, to 3.25%,"" he added. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

"Op-ed: The fuel for the AI boom is advertising. It is also an existential risk.","With OpenAI's recent release of its AI browser, the historic level of capital expenditures being made in the current AI arms race may accelerate even further, if that is possible. From the reciprocal, and some have said circular, nature of hundreds of billions in commitments in investment, tied to future chip purchases, to the extent to which GDP growth is reliant on this boom, some have said this is a bubble. A Harvard economist estimates 92% of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025 was due to investment in AI. But at the same time, the latest wave of AI has the potential to disrupt the very same trillions in market cap that is fueling it. AI will, without question, change how people search (Google), shop (Amazon) and are entertained (Meta). Answers delivered without clicking around the web. AI-assisted shopping. Infinite personalized content creation. If AI represents such a potential existential risk, why are Google, Meta and Amazon such a huge part of the current arms race to invest in AI? The ""moonshot"" outcome of would be that achieving Artificial General Intelligence, or Super Intelligence, AI that can do anything a human can, but better, would unlock so much value that it would dwarf any investment. But there is more immediate urgency to protect, or disrupt, the advertising business model fueling the trillions in market cap and hundreds of billions of current investment, before someone else does. While the seminal paper that launched this phase of AI, ""Attention is All You Need"" was written by mostly Google researchers, it was OpenAI and Microsoft, and now Grok as well, that launched the current AI arms race. And they are not remotely as dependent on the current advertising industrial complex. In fact, Sam Altman has called the feeds of the major platforms using AI to maximize advertising dollars, ""the first at-scale misaligned AIs."" He is clearly stating which businesses he believes OpenAI is trying to disrupt. This time is different, but it also comes with different risks. The major difference with the current fever in infrastructure investment vs the dotcom bubble of 2000, is that in large part the companies funding it are among the most profitable companies in the world. And so far, there has not been indications of cracks in the business model of advertising that is both funding their investments, and their market capitalizations (along with so many massive companies people wouldn't think about being in the advertising business). But if AI does disrupt, or even break, the current advertising model, the shock to the economy and markets would be far greater than most could imagine. Google, Meta and Amazon are still best positioned to create new business models, and as mentioned, have been using AI for far longer to support their advertising business models with great success. However, fundamentally changing the way people interface with search, commerce and content online will require just that, entirely new revenue models, maybe, hopefully, some that are aligned, that are not advertising based. But whatever the model, perhaps it is helpful to consider that the justification in AI infrastructure spending may not be to just unlock new revenue, but to protect the business models that make up a much more significant portion of the market capitalization of public companies than most people are aware.
