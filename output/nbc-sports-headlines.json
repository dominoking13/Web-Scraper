    "headline": "How to watch Tottenham Hotspur vs Fulham live: Stream, TV channel, team news, prediction",
    "content": "Thomas Frank and Spurs need a win, big time, as they host Fulham on Saturday. WATCH — Tottenham Hotspur v Fulham After being hammered 4-1 at bitter rivals Arsenal last Sunday, Frank’s side were better in attack in midweek but still lost 5-3 at PSG. The balance is off for Spurs and perhaps that is predictable given all of the attacking players they are missing through injury. But Frank is under pressure from Spurs fans due to the clunky play on the ball and he could really do with a big home win to calm things down after just one win in their last six games in all competitions. Fulham won 1-0 at home against Sunderland last weekend and two home wins in a row has eased fears they will get sucked into the relegation battle this season. Marco Silva’s side have to improve away from home, as they’ve yet to win away this season and have lost five of their six games on the road. For live updates and highlights throughout Tottenham Hotspur vs Fulham, check out PST’s live blog coverage below. Kick off time: 3pm ET Saturday (November 29)Venue: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium — LondonTV Channel: USAStreaming: Watch live on NBC.com Spurs are without Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Dominic Solanke and Yves Bissouma, while captain and star center back Cristian Romero is suspended for this game. That means Kevin Danso will likely start alongside Micky van de Ven in defense, while Randal Kolo Muani has probably played himself into the starting lineup after two goals and an assist in the defeat at PSG in midweek. Destiny Udogie, Joao Palhinha and Xavi Simons could all come in to start after being on the bench in midweek. Rodrigo Muniz is out until February, which is a big blow, but Fulham’s captain and USMNT star left back Antonee Robinson is close to a return. Sasa Lukic is back from suspension so that is a huge bonus in midfield too. Fulham have been in games all season long but have struggled to score goals and Silva will hope Raul Jimenez grabbing the winner last weekend against Sunderland will boost his confidence and see him go on a scoring run. Spurs will need to be patient but if things click they can hurt Fulham and have some attacking players finding a bit of form. Expect a narrow win for the hosts. Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Fulham.

    "headline": "How to watch Manchester City vs Leeds live: Stream link, TV channel, team news, prediction",
    "content": "Manchester City host Leeds on Saturday with Pep Guardiola’s side aiming to get things back on track after two defeats in a row in all competitions. WATCH — Manchester City vs Leeds Guardiola’s side lost 2-1 at Newcastle last weekend, which was a shock given City’s recent performances, and he made 10 changes for the midweek home game against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League. It didn’t work out as City lost 2-0 despite dominating the game. City are still in the title race but they can’t afford to lose much more ground on leaders Arsenal, so they have to kick on over the festive period. Leeds are really struggling after a bright start to life back in the Premier League. They lost 2-1 at home against Aston Villa last weekend and that is now five defeats in their last six as Daniel Farke is under growing pressure. Leeds are in the relegation zone, which is to be expected, but there are signs they can get out of it. They are only in the relegation zone on goal difference but have City, Chelsea and Liverpool in their next three games, so Leeds will likely be in the bottom three when Christmas rolls around. For live updates and highlights throughout Manchester City vs Leeds, check out PST’s live blog coverage below. Kick off time: 10am ET Saturday (November 29)Venue: Etihad Stadium — ManchesterTV Channel: PeacockStreaming: Stream live on Peacock Mateo Kovacic remains out for City and aside from Rodri being a doubt, the rest of the squad is available. That could now be a bit of a problem for Guardiola as he’s trying to keep everyone happy. But the players who were given the chance to impress against Leverkusen in midweek didn’t get the job done, so Guardiola will probably go straight back to the team which has started most games in recent weeks. Erling Haaland up top with Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden behind him should be the attack. Anton Stach is struggling with a concussion but Leeds are fully-fit aside from that. Will Dominic Calvert-Lewin come back in to start up top? Or will Lukas Nmecha start again? The German striker has scored in each of his last two games and Leeds have USMNT winger Brenden Aaronson and Noah Okafor supporting him well out wide. It will also be intriguing to see if Daniel James and Wilfried Gnonto will start as Leeds will look to hit City on the break. This feels like it could get out of hand quickly if City score early, as they are angry from two defeats over the last week. Manchester City 4-0 Leeds. A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "Justin Fields still sees himself as a starter: I know who I am as a person and a player",
    "content": "Justin Fields is no longer the Jets’ starting quarterback, but he still thinks he has what it takes to start in the NFL. Asked by a reporter whether he still sees himself as a starter, Fields said there’s no question. “Of course. Yes, sir,” Fields said, via ESPN. “I mean, I just know who I am as a person, as a football player, as a hard worker. I think I know I have the mindset and the skill to attain that. I just feel like I need to do it on a more consistent basis, but that’s just what it is. It’s the ups and downs of life and I’m in a -- quote-unquote -- valley right now. But it’s not going to do anything but make me stronger on the back end of it.” Fields didn’t answer directly when asked whether he would be willing to remain with the Jets as a backup. He’s under contract for next season, the second year of his two-year, $40 million contract, and the Jets still owe him $10 million guaranteed even if they cut him. Fields did indicate that he still thinks his relationship with the Jets. can be salvaged. “I’m not going to have that mindset in terms of, ‘Oh, they benched me. I’m not [going] to play here.’ I think that’s a bad mindset to have,” Fields said. Fields’ mindset is that he’s a starter. At this point, it’s unlikely that any NFL team agrees with him.

    "headline": "No. 7 Michigan dominates No. 12 Gonzaga 101-61 to win Players Era Championship",
    "content": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Yaxel Lendeborg had 20 points and 11 rebounds as No. 7 Michigan routed No. 12 Gonzaga 101-61 on Wednesday night to win the Players Era Championship. Trey McKenney added 17 points for the impressive Wolverines (7-0), who dominated every one of their opponents in the event. They won their three games by a combined 110 points, beating San Diego State by 40 and No. 21 Auburn by 30 before handing Mark Few his most lopsided loss in 902 games as Gonzaga’s coach. Lendeborg was selected MVP of the tournament. The 18-team field featured some of the top programs in the country, and Michigan served notice it’s a serious national title contender. Nimari Burnett had 14 points, Aday Mara scored 13 and Morez Johnson Jr. finished with 11 for the Wolverines. The defense limited Gonzaga to 33.8% shooting from the floor, including 3 of 22 from 3-point range (13.6%). Tyon Grant-Foster and Braden Huff led the Bulldogs (7-1) with 14 points each. Huff fouled out with 8:42 left. Michigan scored the last nine points of the first half and led 53-29 at the break. Lendeborg scored four straight points and Burnett hit a 3 with 38 seconds remaining. The Wolverines maintained their 24-point advantage until the 15:55 mark of the second half and then went on a 10-0 run to go up 69-35. Johnson had six points during that stretch and Mara scored three. Gonzaga never got closer than 31 after that. Michigan hosts Rutgers on Dec. 6. Gonzaga plays at No. 19 Kentucky on Dec. 5.
