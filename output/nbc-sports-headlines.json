    "headline": "NFL RedZone has become ridden with commercials, with a big increase since Week 1",
    "content": "For years, the NFL convinced fans to buy the RedZone Channel with the catchphrase, “Seven hours of commercial-free football.” For fans of RedZone, those times were the good old days. And they’re not coming back. NFL RedZone Channel is now riddled with commercials, making a mockery of the league’s previous claims that the addition of commercials on RedZone would be limited in scope. In Week One, the spin from the NFL was that commercials would barely be noticeable — only four short commercials during the whole seven-hour RedZone broadcast. According to Sports Business Journal, by Week 13 the NFL was running 16 ads during RedZone. Half of those feature the audio of a commercial that’s being shown in one box while football can be seen in another box. The other half take over much of the screen with banner ads while football can be seen on a smaller portion of the screen. In many ways, the commercials on RedZone are worse than the commercials for any other broadcast. During a normal game, the commercials come at a predictable time, when the game is in a timeout and the announcers inform viewers that they’re going to a break. Viewers are prepared for those commercials. On RedZone, the commercials just interrupt the broadcast with no warning, suddenly appearing on the screen that a moment earlier had been showing football. You know, football — the “commercial free” thing the NFL once assured us we were going to watch when we paid for RedZone. But commercials now proliferate on the RedZone Channel, and there’s no reason to believe there’s any end in sight. Commercials will continue increasing, and for football fans, the experience of spending a Sunday watching RedZone Channel will continue to get worse. A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "Marcus Jones credits his dad and his blockers for being NFL’s all-time punt return leader",
    "content": "Patriots punt returner Marcus Jones broke an NFL record on Monday night that had stood for 75 years. The record for the most yards per punt return had belonged to former Bears punt returner George McAfee, who played from 1940 to 1950 and averaged 12.78 yards returning punts in his career. To qualify for that record, a player needs at least 75 career punt returns. On Monday night, Jones made a spectacular play on the 75th punt return of his career, taking it back 94 yards for a touchdown. Jones ended the night with three punt returns for 124 yards, which gives him 77 punt returns for 1,127 yards in his career. That gives him a career average of 14.64 yards per punt return, breaking McAfee’s record by nearly two full yards. After the game, Jones credited his father and his blockers. “Whenever my dad had me in a parking lot when I was like 4 years old, he used to throw the ball in the air and be like, ‘Track it.’ That was the first thing I thought about,” Jones said. “It’s a long journey with punt returns. Everyone doesn’t want to do it. I find a lot of joy when it comes down to it. At the end of the day, ever since I got in the league, I would say the guys that have been blocking for me, I commend them 24/7. Without them I would not be able to get any yards.” Jones knows that opposing punters often give him high and short punts because they want to limit returns, and he says he needs to balance being aggressive with being smart. “The main thing is decision making,” Jones said. “Of course I want to be aggressive, but I also have to be smart at the same time. Whenever there are punts up there I got to go ahead and fair catch, but I try to take advantage of every opportunity I get, so whenever I get time I try to make a play.” Jones has made a lot of plays in his NFL career.

    "headline": "2026 Giro to start in Bulgaria, be decided in the Dolomites, and finish in Rome",
    "content": "Simon Yates stands close to the trophy during the presentation of the 2026 Giro d’Italia for men and women in Rome, Italy, on December 1, 2025. (Photo by Massimo Valicchia/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images ROME — Next year’s Giro d’Italia will start with three stages in Bulgaria and will likely be decided in the Dolomites before the mostly ceremonial finish in Rome. The route for the 109th Giro, scheduled for May 8-31, was presented in Rome on Monday. It’s the 16th time the Italian Grand Tour is starting abroad. After the opening in Bulgaria, the peloton will fly to Calabria to begin a climb up boot-shaped Italy, passing through Naples and a difficult ascent to Blockhaus in Abruzzo. The race’s only time trial is a 40.2-kilometer (25-mile) individual race against the clock in Stage 10 from Viareggio to Massa along the Tuscan coast. The toughest leg, known as the queen stage, is slated to be Stage 19 from Feltre to Alleghe going over five climbs including the Passo Giau, which marks the “Cima Coppi” as the race’s highest point at 2,233 meters (7,326 feet). Then there are two ascents the next day to Piancavallo in the penultimate leg, which could decide the winner. “This year we have designed a more modern Giro, with shorter stages that are no less demanding for the general classification contenders, alternating with stages that will suit riders looking to make an impact with long-range attacks,” race director Mauro Vegni said. “There will be seven summit finishes, the same number of stages for the sprinters.” The nine-stage Women’s Giro will start in Cesenatico on May 30 and finish in Saluzzo on June 7. There are two summit finishes at Nevegal and Sestriere, with the latter stage including the famous climb to Colle delle Finestre. Adam Yates and Elisa Longo Borghini won the Giro this year. Yates is expected to try and defend his title, and could be joined by Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Jonas Vingegaard, the two-time Tour de France champion. Other challengers could include rising Mexican rider Isaac del Toro, who lost the lead to Yates in the penultimate stage this year, and Primoz Roglic, the 2023 Giro champion. “The emotions I felt at the end of this (year’s) Giro were incredible and I really hope to experience them again,” Yates said.

    "headline": "Murray doesn’t regret ‘disappointing’ coaching stint with Djokovic",
    "content": "Andy Murray (left) chats with Novak Djokovic as he takes a break from his practice session at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells, Calif., Wednesday, March 5, 2025. Andy Abeyta/The Desert Sun / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images LONDON — Andy Murray says he was “disappointed” with Novak Djokovic’s results during his time coaching his former rival. Murray joined Djokovic’s coaching team in November 2024 just three months after the 38-year-old Scot ended his own playing career at the Paris Olympics. But it proved a short six-month partnership as the pair was together for only the Australian Open and five other tournaments this year. “I look back on it and I’m glad that I did it,” Murray told The Tennis Podcast. “It’s an amazing experience that I’ve had. It didn’t last long but I put everything into it. I was disappointed. Probably didn’t get the results I would have liked for him. “It was a good opportunity because I felt I wanted to coach at some stage and if I didn’t take it I might look back and think it would have been really interesting, I could have learned a lot, or potentially regretted it.” Djokovic overcame Carlos Alcaraz to reach the semifinals at the Australian Open but in the process he tore his left hamstring. The 24-time Grand Slam champion then retired after one set against Alexander Zverev and was booed off the court. When he returned, the 38-year-old Serb suffered opening losses in Qatar and Indian Wells. Then he reached the Miami Open final but lost to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik. Murray initially planned to coach Djokovic to the French Open but the partnership ended in May after first-up defeats on clay in Monte Carlo and Madrid. “It was going well initially and it was unfortunate what happened in Australia with the injury, but I watched him play ridiculous tennis in that tournament,” Murray said. “After the injury it was certainly a difficult few months for him but also I think for the team and all of us. I learned a lot about what coaching is. I was fully invested, tried my hardest to help, and made some good relationships along the way with his team.” A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "Reports: UCLA plans to hire James Madison’s Bob Chesney as its next football coach",
    "content": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — James Madison’s Bob Chesney is expected to be hired as UCLA’s new football coach, according to multiple reports Monday. The Bruins have not yet announced a deal with Chesney, whose No. 19 Dukes are 11-1 heading into the Sun Belt Conference title game against Troy on Friday. With a win, James Madison has a chance to be in the College Football Playoff. UCLA finished 3-9 this season under interim coach Tim Skipper, who replaced DeShaun Foster three games into the year. Foster went 5-10 as the stopgap replacement for Chip Kelly, who abruptly left the Bruins in February 2024, well after the year’s coaching cycle had concluded. The high-priced Kelly’s underwhelming six-year tenure was the latest football disappointment for the Bruins, who have just three 10-win seasons and no conference titles in the 21st century. UCLA has had seven losing seasons in the last decade and is 6-12 in conference play in its first two seasons in the Big Ten. The 48-year-old Chesney has stellar credentials after going 20-5 in two standout seasons at James Madison as the replacement for Curt Cignetti. Before that, the Pennsylvania native went 44-21 in six seasons at Holy Cross in the FCS. His success made him one of the hottest candidates in the current coaching cycle, and UCLA quickly identified Chesney as a candidate to fix a program with significant potential beyond its recent achievements. Along with its attractive campus in talent-rich Los Angeles, the Bruins have solid training facilities in Westwood while playing their home games at the Rose Bowl ahead of a possible move to SoFi Stadium as soon as next season. Foster was fired when UCLA got off to a dismal 0-3 start this season despite the arrival of quarterback Nico Iamaleava, a Tennessee transfer. Skipper, a well-liked veteran assistant coach, improbably led the Bruins to three consecutive wins over Penn State, Michigan State and Maryland before the Bruins lost their final five games.
