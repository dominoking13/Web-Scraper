    "headline": "Justin Herbert underwent surgery on his left hand Monday",
    "content": "Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert underwent surgery Monday to repair the broken bone in his left hand. “Chargers QB Justin Herbert underwent successful surgery today in Los Angeles to stabilize a fracture in his left hand,” the team said in a statement. “Herbert’s return to play is considered day-to-day, and his status for next Monday’s game against Philadelphia will be determined later in the week.” Herbert injured his left hand in the first series at the end of a 1-yard scramble when Panthers defensive back Jeremy Chinn slammed the quarterback to the ground. Herbert’s hand banged against the turf. Herbert threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Quentin Johnston on the next play, giving the Chargers a 7-0 lead after their first possession. Herbert missed eight plays in the training room, with Trey Lance replacing him, before returning to the game with 11:56 remaining in the second quarter. He remained under center — instead of in the shotgun or pistol — the rest of the game. “They just put a hard cast on it, put a glove around it. I think that was basically it,” Herbert said postgame. The Chargers play the Eagles next Monday night, and Herbert said after Sunday’s win over the Raiders that he is hopeful of playing. A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "Kyren Williams, Davante Adams are good to go for Week 14",
    "content": "Rams running back Kyren Williams and wide receiver Davante Adams came out of Sunday’s game with no concerning injuries, coach Sean McVay said Monday. “Nothing that we expect to restrict guys from being available this week,” McVay said, via Adam Schefter of ESPN. “We might limit some guys in practice once we see how they come in [Tuesday], but nothing that we expect to affect game statuses for Arizona.” Williams left the loss to the Panthers with an ankle issue. He played 35 of 52 snaps and had 13 carries for 72 yards and a touchdown. McVay said Williams’ ankle was “pretty good,” as the scar tissue from previous injuries made it easier to deal with in-game. Adams had hamstring soreness but played 39 snaps and made four catches for 58 yards and two touchdowns. A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "David Blough will be the Commanders’ quarterbacks coach for the rest of the season",
    "content": "The Commanders lost a member of their coaching staff after Sunday night’s loss to the Broncos.

    "headline": "Kyler Murray won’t return to practice this week",
    "content": "Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray has missed the last four games while on injured reserve, which means he is now eligible to return to practice and be activated to play in games. That’s not going to happen this week, however. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said at his Monday press conference that Murray is “not quite there yet” in his recovery from a foot injury. When Murray was injured, there was a lot of speculation that he might not return to the lineup again this season even if he’s healthy and that the two sides are on track to part ways when the season is over. During an appearance on Arizona Sports Monday, Gannon said that he has no objection to playing Murray if the quarterback is well enough to play. “Between myself and [General Manager Monti Ossenfort], we are all about trying to win a game here,” Gannon said. “We’re going to make every decision predicated on that and what’s best for the team.” Jacoby Brissett has been the Cardinals’ starter in Murray’s absence and he will remain in that role against the Rams in Week 14.
