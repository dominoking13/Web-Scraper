    "headline": "Lamar Jackson: I need to be consistent, not miss throws in games that I make in practice",
    "content": "Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson made a bad Bengals defense look good on Thanksgiving night, completing only 17 of 32 passes while throwing an interception, losing two fumbles and failing to throw a touchdown pass. He stressed afterward that inconsistency has been an issue he needs to address “I just got to play consistent,” Jackson said, via ESPN. Jackson has had multiple injuries this season but said those aren’t affecting him. “No, I just got to be more consistent,” Jackson said. “I got to make those throws. I don’t miss them in practice, so I shouldn’t be missing them in the game.” The loss to the Bengals dropped the Ravens’ record to 6-6 on the season, and Jackson knows he and his teammates need to turn things around. “I just got to be consistent,” Jackson said. “We all just got to be consistent.” A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "Matt LaFleur on Packers beating Lions: Fourth downs were the difference in the game",
    "content": "Lions head coach Dan Campbell has earned a reputation as the best coach in the NFL at making fourth down calls. But on Thanksgiving in Detroit, it was Packers coach Matt LaFleur whose fourth-down calls came up big. The Packers went 3-for-3 on fourth downs and the Lions went 0-for-2 on fourth downs in the Packers’ 31-24 win. LaFleur said that’s why the Packers won. “We knew going into the game, Dan’s always been aggressive and we knew it was going to come down to that,” LaFleur said. “Really, when you look at it, both sides of the ball, fourth down was the difference in the game.” All of the fourth downs were significant plays: The Packers’ first two touchdowns came on fourth downs, and the final first down that allowed them to seal the win came on a fourth-down conversion. The Lions’ first failed fourth down led to another Packers score, and the Lions’ other failed fourth down ended a promising drive. LaFleur said it helped with the Packers’ third-down play calling that he could tell quarterback Jordan Love ahead of third down that the offense had two plays. “I told Jordan, ‘We’ve got two downs here,’” LaFleur said. On Thanksgiving, LaFleur beat Campbell at his own game. A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "Report: Josh Simmons out indefinitely with dislocated, fractured wrist",
    "content": "The Chiefs will not have their left tackle for the foreseeable future. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Media, Josh Simmons suffered a dislocated and fractured wrist during Thursday’s loss to the Cowboys. While he will receive an MRI on Friday to help determine a course of treatment, he is considered out indefinitely. Simmons exited AT&T Stadium in a cast. Simmons, the No. 32 overall pick of this year’s draft, missed several games while dealing with a personal matter in California earlier this year. He returned for the Week 11 loss to Denver, starting Kansas City’s last three games. Jaylon Moore started at left tackle in Simmons’ stead during his absence and would presumably take over at the spot again. A Division of NBCUniversal.
