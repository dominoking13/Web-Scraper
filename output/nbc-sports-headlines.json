    "headline": "NFL will again celebrate the John Madden legacy on Thanksgiving",
    "content": "For years, Americans welcomed John Madden into their homes on Thanksgiving. The NFL is ensuring that Madden’s legacy remains a part of the holiday. This year the NFL will once again celebrate Madden on Thanksgiving, with tributes to Madden broadcast on Fox, CBS and NBC during the Packers-Lions, Chiefs-Cowboys and Bengals-Ravens game. Players on all six teams will wear patches honoring Madden’s legacy on their jerseys, and the coin toss for all three games will feature a silhouette of Madden as heads and a six-legged turducken as tails. The MVP of each of the three games will receive a Madden trophy and will choose a high school or youth football program that will receive a $10,000 donation from the NFL Foundation. Items from the three games will also be auctioned with proceeds going to the John Madden Foundation for the youth of Oakland. As part of the Bengals-Ravens game, Peacock will offer an EA Sports Madden NFL Cast that blends elements of the video game with the live broadcast. The Madden NFL Cast will use the sky cam angle behind the quarterback as the primary camera angle, the same primary angle that Madden players are accustomed to. Madden was known to one generation of football fans as a Hall of Fame coach, to a second generation as the NFL’s most popular broadcaster, and to a third generation for the video game that bears his name. He died in December of 2021 at the age of 85. Since 2022, the NFL has honored him each year on Thanksgiving. A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "Jaxon Smith-Njiba accounts for historic share of Seahawks’ passing game",
    "content": "Jaxon Smith-Njigba is on pace to become the first player in NFL history to generate 2,000 or more receiving yards. His relative contribution to Seattle’s passing game is historic, too. Via Josh Dubow of the Associated Press, Smith-Njigba has 46.9 percent of the team’s receiving yards in 2025. Only four other players have finished a season since 1948 with a higher share. The others were Lance Alworth, who had 47.4 percent of the receiving yards for the 1965 Chargers (he finished with 1,602 yards), Elbie Nickel, who had 48.3 percent of the receiving yards for the 1949 Steelers (633 yards), Ken Burrough, who had 50.6 percent of the receiving yards for the 1975 Oilers (1,063 yards), and Harlon Hill, who had 51.4 percent of the receiving yards for the 1956 Bears (1,128 yards). Through 11 games, Smith-Njigba has 1,313 receiving yards. It projects to 2,029 receiving yards. Calvin Johnson set the single-season record in 2012, with 1,964 yards. The total performance, and the relative production, should inject Smith-Njigba into the MVP conversation. He’s currently 40-1 to win an award that no receiver has ever won.
