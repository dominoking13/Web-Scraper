    "headline": "Kyle Shanahan: I’m proud of Jauan Jennings for response to Tre’Von Moehig cheap shot",
    "content": "San Francisco receiver Jauan Jennings and Carolina safety Tre’Von Moehig could both be disciplined for their actions at the end of Monday night’s game, but 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan says Jennings handled himself appropriately. In the fourth quarter, Moehig punched Jennings in the groin. Jennings waited until after the game to respond, with a slap to the facemask. Shanahan backed his player afterward. “The guy took a cheap shot and hit him in the balls. I was real proud of Jauan for not losing his mind out there and getting to the sideline,” Shanahan said. Both players will at least be fined, and could be suspended, for their actions. Shanahan will not be happy if Jennings is suspended, given what he was reacting to. A Division of NBCUniversal.

    "headline": "How to watch Chelsea vs Barcelona live: Stream link, TV channel, team news, prediction",
    "content": "Chelsea host Barcelona on Tuesday at Stamford Bridge in what promises to be a brilliant UEFA Champions League encounter. MORE — Are Chelsea really in the Premier League title race? This fixture evokes so many wonderful Champions League memories with classic games and stunning individual moments from superstars littering fixtures between these two in this competition over the years. Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea are in great form, winning five of their last six in the Premier League and they’ve won their last three without conceding a goal. Injuries have impacted Chelsea throughout this season and they’ve missed some big players. But this young side are in the Premier League title race and are also adapting well to life back in the Champions League, even if a heavily-rotated side drew at Qarabag last time out. This clash against Barcelona is the biggest test for Maresca so far and it will be intriguing to see how they approach it as their young side usually just go for it. Hansi Flick’s Barcelona do that too, and like Chelsea they have so many talented youngsters. The reigning La Liga champions reached the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League last season but lost in thrilling fashion to Inter Milan. Drama and taking risks sums up this Barca side and they have won two of their four Champions League games so far (their only loss was 2-1 to PSG) as they drew their last outing 3-3 at Club Brugge and it could’ve been 7-7. Their high defensive line causes problems for them at the back but their incredible attackers always look like scoring bunches of goals. For live updates and highlights throughout Chelsea vs Barcelona, check out PST’s live blog coverage below. Kick off time: 3pm ET Tuesday (November 25)Venue: Stamford Bridge — West LondonTV Channel/Streaming: Paramount+ After recovering from his groin injury, Cole Palmer remains out as he fractured his toe after subbing it at home. Chelsea have a couple of other injury concerns as Romeo Lavia remains out and Levi Colwill is a long-term absentee. Moises Caicedo was rested at the weekend and he will come back into the team and be so important in stopping the flow of Barcelona’s incredible attackers. With Arsenal coming in a huge league game on Sunday at Stamford Bridge, Maresca may rotate his side a little but it’s very likely the majority of his key players will start against Barca. Flick has so many options in attack but the trio of Robert Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal and Marcus Rashford seem certain to start. He also has Dani Olmo, Ferran Torres and Raphinha to call on if needed. Not bad... Midfield has also been key to Barca’s success over the last 12 months with Frenkie de Jong controlling games but Pedri has been struggling with an injury and is a doubt. Defensively Barca need to stop the counter attacks as much as they can because Chelsea are particularly strong in that area with Estevao, Garnacho, Neto and Gittens all ready to pounce. Speaking of spectacular wingers: Barcelona’s Brazilian star Raphinha made his long-awaited return from injury at the weekend and is likely to come off the bench in this game. This feels like it’s going to be a particularly bonkers game and Barcelona’s forwards are more experienced and will make the most of what will surely be an end-to-end encounter.

    "headline": "Jauan Jennings, Tre’Von Moehrig face discipline for late-game scuffle",
    "content": "Things got a little spicy and the end of a largely blah game, and it raises the prospect of discipline for those involved. After the clock ran out on the 49ers’ 20-9 win over the Panthers, San Francisco receiver Jauan Jennings went after Panthers safety Tre’Von Moehig, giving him an open right hand to the facemask and anther shove before they were separated. ESPN then showed what caused it. Moments earlier, Moehrig had punched Jennings in the crotch at the end of a play. Both will surely be fined. The question is whether, under the precedent set by the Week 5 one-game suspension of Lions safety Brian Branch for hitting Chiefs receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster after the game had ended, Jennings will be suspended. The league has been very aggressive this year regarding sportsmanship issues. So it makes sense to monitor this one throughout the day on Tuesday. On Sunday, the 49ers face the Browns in Cleveland.

    "content": "The Panthers offense took its time getting going on Monday night, but their biggest play of the night has brought them back within one score of the 49ers. Quarterback Bryce Young hit wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan for a 29-yard touchdown with 49 seconds left in the third quarter. It was the longest play of the night for either team. The 49ers were penalized on the extra point, so the Panthers decided to go for two points from the 1-yard line. Young’s pass to wide receiver Jalen Coker was incomplete, though, and the 49ers remain up 17-9. Young is now 12-of-19 for 104 yards, a touchdown and an interception. A Division of NBCUniversal.
