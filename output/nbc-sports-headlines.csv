"Liverpool vs Nottingham Forest LIVE updates, watch live, score, analysis, highlights","Liverpool boss Arne Slot will be hoping the international break did his superstars the world of good as they aim to get back to winning ways when Nottingham Forest visit Anfield on Saturday. WATCH — Liverpool v Nottingham Forest For live updates and highlights throughout Liverpool vs Nottingham Forest, check out PST’s live blog coverage below. Kick off time: 10am ET Saturday (November 22)Venue: Anfield — Liverpool TV Channel: Peacock and NBCSNStreaming: Stream live on Peacock Goalscorers: Murillo (33'), Nicolo Savona (46') Alisson - Jones, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez - Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Szoboszlai - Salah, Gakpo, Isak Sels - Savona, Milenkovic, Murillo, Williams - Sangare, Anderson, Gibbs-White - Ndoye, Dominguez, Jesus Slot’s side lost 3-0 at Manchester City before the break and the scoreline flattered Liverpool. They had shown signs of recovery before that thrashing at City, as they secured back-to-back home wins against Aston Villa in the league and Real Madrid in the Champions League. But something is off with Liverpool’s balance and they desperately need Mohamed Salah to recapture his best form. Liverpool sit eight points behind leaders Arsenal but they’re not panicking just yet (despite five defeats in their last six) with Virgil van Dijk far from giving up on winning back-to-back Premier League titles. Forest have found some kind of form under new manager Sean Dyche as they beat Leeds United 3-1 at home before the break, as they built on their impressive home draw with Manchester United. Forest still sit in the relegation zone but are only one point from safety and Dyche seems to have found some defensive solidity as they’ve gone back to being dangerous on the counter. Alexander Isak played for Sweden during the international break and should be ready to lead the line, but now Florian Wirtz is out of the attack through injury. Does Hugo Ekitike start on the left? Or will Cody Gakpo get the nod in that position? There’s also a discussion to be had about whether or not Salah needs to be dropped on the right given his poor form. Defensively Andy Robertson is a lock at full back now, while Alisson could start but Giorgi Mamardashvili’s form means Liverpool haven’t rushed the Brazilian goalkeeper back. Right back is also a huge question as Conor Bradley and Jeremie Frimpong will miss the game. Dyche has largely gone back to Forest’s tactics which worked so well from last season and it has worked well in recent weeks. Forest’s 4-2-3-1 formation has Igor Jesus up top (Chris Wood is close to being fit) and the duo of Ibrahim Sangare and Elliot Anderson in midfield have been so solid and have helped shore things up defensively. Forest will sit back and look to hit Liverpool on the counter. This feels like it will be a really tough game for Liverpool, especially after the international break. They will have to grind it out but they will get the job done. Just. Liverpool 2-1 Nottingham Forest. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur: ‘The set-piece derby’ as rivals rely on marginal gains","No team has scored more set-piece goals than Arsenal in the Premier League this season. No team has conceded fewer set-piece goals than Tottenham Hotspur this season. The ‘set-piece derby’ is here. Expect ‘set-piece again, ole, ole!’ to be sung at the Emirates this Sunday in the north London derby. But from the home or away end? MORE — Premier League table Arsenal have scored the most goals from corners (8) and Spurs have scored the second most (6) this season, while these rivals also lead the Premier League in headed goals with seven and six respectively and Arsenal have had a league-leading 75 corners, with Spurs attempting 67. As we will see in an intriguing north London derby, set pieces are hugely important to both Mikel Arteta and Thomas Frank and both are leaning heavily on them to achieve their respective goals of trophies and a top four finish this season. Despite plenty of key injuries (again) Arsenal sit top of the Premier League and have a four-point lead over Man City in second, with Spurs in fifth as teething issues with their attack and home form has hampered Frank’s first few months in charge. This huge north London derby is going to be decided by the small margins. Just the way both Arteta and Frank like it. The Spiderman meme is apt when talking about these two managers. Set pieces have become so important to Arsenal in recent seasons as they’ve dominated the Premier League in terms of creating chances, and scoring, from corners, long throws and free kicks. Nobody is close to them. No Premier League team has scored a higher percentage of their goals (50 percent) from set-pieces this season than Arsenal and four of their last six goals against Spurs have come from corners. Even if their main menace when attacking set pieces, Gabriel, is out injured for Sunday’s clash, Arsenal’s entire team will continue to cause chaos and smell blood when a ball is flung in. If there’s one manager who won’t be intimidated by Arsenal’s set-piece expertise it’s Frank. The Dane brought set-pieces back into fashion in a big way during his hugely successful spell at Brentford, but Arteta and Arsenal have made set-pieces sexy again. Set-piece coaches like Arsenal’s Nicolas Jover are now revered across the game. It surely won’t be long until they have their own technical area on the sidelines to dictate the increasingly important moments which so often decide games. Even if Frank’s first few months at Spurs haven’t seen his side score as many from set-pieces as he would like (they’re still ranked fifth in the PL in terms of goals scored) his Spurs side have the best record when it comes to defending set-pieces this season as they’ve conceded just twice. That is a huge improvement on last season and Frank’s pragmatism is a big reason he was hired. Frank is the best head coach in the Premier League at prioritizing marginal gains, especially from set pieces, and he has always made it a huge focus. Look at what he did with Brentford. He closed the clear huge financial gap holding them back by focusing heavily on these situations and the rest of the Premier League took notice. And there is plenty of optimism for Spurs despite their awful record in this recent fixture. Yes, Arsenal have won five of their last six league games against Spurs, with Spurs winning just one of their last 32 Premier League away trips to Arsenal, but Spurs go into this game as the away-day specialists in the Premier League. This season they have the best away record in the Premier League with 13 points won from a possible 15 and they’ve scored the most (12) and conceded the fewest (3) on their travels. But history has taught Spurs fans to be more cautious against Arsenal than any other opponent. Not just because it’s their biggest rival but because they’ve dropped more points (48) from winning positions against Arsenal than any team in Premier League history has done against a single opponent. However many times the lead changes or whatever the result is on Sunday, it’s a very safe bet that a set-piece goal will be pivotal in this version of the north London derby.

"How to watch Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur live: Stream, TV channel, team news, prediction","The final international break of 2025 is done and dusted, and what a way for the Premier League to return with Arsenal hosting Tottenham Hotspur in the north London derby on Sunday (11:30 am ET). WATCH — Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur The Gunners (26 points) are top of the table after 11 games, four points clear of Manchester City and eight above defending champions Liverpool (currently in 8th place), the only side to Mikel Arteta’s men in any competition this season. But injuries are starting to pile up for Arsenal and perhaps the first cracks came to light just before the break, when they conceded a stoppage-time equalizer and drew newly promoted Sunderland 2-2. A handful of key attackers could be available off the bench this weekend, as Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke are all close to returning. Speaking of the walking wounded, Spurs are once again atop the injury list with four central midfielders and two strikers unavailable for Thomas Frank’s suddenly shorthanded side. Predictably, Spurs have struggled to create scoring chances (11.0 xG from 11 games, 6th-lowest) and, much like Arsenal, made the most of set pieces to cobble together the PL’s 4th-best attacking record (19 goals). Spurs have scored six times from set pieces thus far, to Arsenal’s eye-popping tally of 10 (half of their 20 on the season).

"Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur predicted lineups, team news: Where will north London derby be won and lost?","Injuries have ravaged both sides ahead of Sunday’s north London derby between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, but the show must go on as the Gunners chase their first Premier League title since 2004 and Spurs seek Champions League qualification once again. MORE — Preview, prediction, how to watch Man City v Liverpool Arsenal are four points clear of the field after 11 games thanks to an incredibly deep squad of world-class talent. Captain Martin Odegaard hasn’t played a minute since Oct. 4 (just 204 minutes in the PL this season), thrusting summer signing Eberechi Eze (1 goal, 2 assists) into the spotlight even more than his $80-million price tag would have done. Leandro Trossard (2 goals, 2 assists) has picked up the slack in the wake of Gabriel Martinelli and Noni Madueke’s injuries have handicapped them thus far (1 goal, 0 assists between). And that’s the benefit of a squad as deep as Mikel Arteta has cultivated six years into his tenure. On the other side, Thomas Frank is three months into the job of trying to turn Ange Postecoglou’s Europa League winners into a more stable, consistent competitor for the long term. 19-year-old Lucas Bergvall is the only fit midfielder with an attacking bone in his body, yet Spurs are punching above their weight to an increased emphasis on set pieces. Both sides have prioritized dead-ball opportunities (and will continue to do so on Sunday), but can Spurs create scoring chances any other way?

"Are Chelsea really in the Premier League title race?","Chelsea sit just three points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal ahead of their game against Spurs on Sunday, but nobody is really talking about Chelsea as title contenders. MORE — Recap, video highlights, reaction Are we sleeping on Chelsea? Their 2-0 win at Burnley on Saturday was their third-straight shutout victory in the Premier League and they’ve won five of their last six in the league. With a huge game in the UEFA Champions League coming up against Barcelona at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday followed by another massive clash against Arsenal at home next Sunday, we are about to find out if this young Chelsea side can hang in the title race. I asked Moises Caicedo about Chelsea being in the title race after their thrilling late win against Liverpool last month, and the Blues’ player of the season so far was trying to stay calm. “It’s too early to say,” Caicedo explained. “For sure we want to win the Premier League but we’re all step-by-step because it’s Premier League and is tough but we want to do our best in this Premier League this season... The Premier League is so difficult, you need to be consistent so we show our quality. We show our character on the pitch and for sure we want to continue with this momentum.” We already know Chelsea have an extremely deep squad after a huge amount of spending in recent years on young, talented players and that has helped them massively during a really unlucky run with injuries with superstar Cole Palmer out for a while now, plus constant changes in midfield and defense as injuries and suspensions piled up in recent months. Manager Enzo Maresca has created an identity and flexibility about this Chelsea side because, yes, they love to keep the ball and players have the freedom to drift across the pitch, but they also can be lethal on the counter and have become really tough to break down as improvement have been made in defense. Chelsea are flexible and durable and they are learning. After their Club World Cup success in the summer they are still full of confidence and even though the odd bump in the road has appeared along the way this season (a draw at Qarabag in the Champions League and defeats at home to Brighton and Sunderland), their ceiling is extremely high. Once Palmer returns and players coming in and out of the team gain full fitness, this Chelsea side are a scary proposition. Their squad is deeper than any other team in the Premier League and if they can keep finding new ways to win games, they’ll hang in this title race all season long. These upcoming games at home against Barcelona and Arsenal this week are going to teach us an awful lot about how good this Chelsea side is. “When you beat big teams it’s so important for us, to have confidence,” Caicedo explained. This Chelsea side is already feeling confident this season and the upcoming week is going to be intriguing. Pretty soon most people will be talking about Chelsea being in the title race.
