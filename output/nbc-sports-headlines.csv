"Ben Johnson: Bears’ win over Eagles doesn’t happen without our offensive line","The Bears ran for 281 yards in Friday’s win over the Eagles, and both of their running backs, with running back Kyle Monangai gaining 130 yards and D’Andre Swift gaining 125 yards. That doesn’t happen without great offensive line play. Bears coach Ben Johnson made a point after the game of mentioning left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, left guard Joe Thuney, center Drew Dallman, right guard Jonah Jackson and right tackle Darnell Wright. “It doesn’t happen without that offensive line,” Johnson said. “You can’t say enough about Ozzy and Joe and Drew Dallman, and Jonah and Darnell. Those guys, they were huge for us. Really proud of them.” On a windy day in Philadelphia, Bears quarterback Caleb Williams completed just 17 of 36 passes for 154 yards, and Johnson said afterward that he should have stuck with the running game even more than he did. “I look down and I see 36 attempts and I go, ‘Shoot, I probably called too many pass plays in this game,’ especially with how we were running it, so that’s an area that I can be better at,” Johnson said. But in a cold and blustery game, the big guys upfront can make all the difference, and that’s what Johnson wanted to call attention to after the game: “I can’t say enough good things about our offensive line today.” A Division of NBCUniversal.

"No. 2 Indiana moves to 12-0, earns Big Ten title game spot with 56-3 win at Purdue","WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Kaelon Black had two touchdown runs and Fernando Mendoza and Roman Hemby each ran for scores as No. 2 Indiana beat rival Purdue 56-3 on Friday night, completing the first perfect regular season in school history and securing a Big Ten championship game berth. The Hoosiers (12-0, 9-0, No. 2 CFP) also likely locked up a second straight College Football Playoff berth. They’ll find out Saturday whether they’ll play No. 1 Ohio State, No. 5 Oregon or No. 15 Michigan a week later for the conference title. Indiana celebrated by hoisting the Old Oaken Bucket in the series’ 100th trophy game, while Curt Cignetti became the first Hoosiers coach since Bo McMillin in 1934-35 to win his first two matchups against Purdue. “I think we put on one or two,” Cignetti said when asked about his pregame remark that he wanted to finish the season with an exclamation point instead of a question mark. “It was a good day.” Purdue (2-10, 0-9) endured more misery in the coldest game ever played at Ross-Ade Stadium, with a kickoff temperature of 24 degrees Fahrenheit. The Boilermakers closed coach Barry Odom’s first season with a 10th straight loss and posted their second straight winless season in conference play, the first since 1919-20. It took the Hoosiers a quarter to adapt to the chilly conditions. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it’s your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. Mendoza, who grew up in Miami and previously attended California, struggled. He went 8 of 15 for 117 yards and two TDs in less than three quarters. So the Hoosiers flipped the script. Black opened the scoring with a 1-yard run, Mendoza scooted 7 yards to make it 14-3 early in the second quarter, and Black spun away from a defender for a nimble 16-yard TD run with 3:40 to play in the first half. Hemby closed out the first-half scoring with an 82-yard TD run down Purdue’s sideline, stiff-arming the only potential tackler who had a chance to catch him, for a 28-3 lead. The Hoosiers sealed it with Mendoza’s two third-quarter TD passes — 17 yards to Elijah Sarratt and 43 yards to Omar Cooper Jr. Odom didn’t want to discuss how the Boilermakers suffered their worst home loss to Indiana one year after suffering the worst loss in school history to the Hoosiers, 66-0. Instead, he was pondering how to turn things around next season, starting in the transfer portal. “I want guys that really like ball, guys that like the process of what it’s supposed to take,” he said. “There is going to be a high value placed on guys that have great toughness, that are not just chasing a check, they’re chasing the opportunity to get developed and get a degree.” Hemby had 12 carries for a season-high 152 yards while Black ran 13 times for 66 yards. Indiana finished with 355 yards rushing, its second-highest total this season and sixth 300-yard game this season. Purdue’s Ryan Browne was 25 of 47 for 238 yards and threw an interception on the second offensive play of the game. The Boilermakers had just 282 total yards. Purdue: The Boilermakers were more competitive in 2025 than 2024. But the result was similar. Purdue enters next year on another losing streak, this time 10 games instead of 11, and still trying to snap its school-record 18-game skid in conference play. Indiana: Many wondered if the Hoosiers would be one-hit wonders after last year’s historic season. But Cignetti promised there would be no decline in 2025 — and there wasn’t. With the nation’s second-best scoring offense and scoring defense, a Heisman Trophy front-runner and a perfect record, the Hoosiers are better positioned to make a playoff run than they were last year.

"No. 16 Texas spoils No. 3 Texas A&M’s perfect season 27-17, knocks Aggies out of SEC title game","AUSTIN, Texas — Arch Manning threw a touchdown pass and ran for the clinching score late in the fourth quarter and No. 16 Texas beat No. 3 Texas A&M 27-17 on Friday night to spoil the Aggies’ undefeated season and knock them out of the Southeastern Conference championship game. Manning’s 29-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Wingo in the third quarter gave Texas (9-3, 6-2 SEC, No, 16 CFP) a 13-10 lead in what had been a tight, defensive game. His 35-yard run up the middle on third down with 7:04 left to play put the Longhorns up 27-17. Texas, which started the season No. 1 and at one point was unranked, beat a top-10 opponent for the third time this season to keep alive any faint hopes of making the College Football Playoff for the third consecutive time. “We are absolutely a playoff team,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said, “and worthy of an opportunity to play for a national championship.” Texas would be the first three-loss team to make the playoffs. Two of those losses came against No. 1 Ohio State and No. 4 Georgia, but an early loss to Florida could doom their chances. Sarkisian said Texas should be rewarded, not punished for scheduling an out-of-conference matchup with the Buckeyes to start the season. “If we’re a 10-2 team right now, this isn’t a discussion,” Sarkisian said. The Aggies (11-1, 7-1, No. 3 CFP) are all but assured their first playoff berth, but the loss to their biggest rival will sting the program for a long time. Texas A&M has never played for an SEC title since joining the league in the 2012 season. “Hurts a lot,” Texas A&M linebacker Taurean York said. “But you got to regroup and get ready for the playoffs. Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed, who had emerged as a late-season Heisman Trophy contender and led the Aggies’ in a stunning second-half rally against South Carolina two weeks ago, threw two fourth-quarter interceptions against the Longhorns, one of them at the Texas 3. Texas A&M led 10-3 at halftime before Texas seized control with 17 consecutive points in the third quarter. The Aggies pulled to 20-17 before Manning’s big TD run. Facing third-and-short, Manning ran through the right side of the line, found a seam to slip into the secondary, and clutched the ball tightly as he crossed the goal line ahead of a lunging defender. Manning completed nine of his last 12 passes for 151 yards to six difference receivers and also ran for 53 yards. His touchdown throw to Wingo came when Manning could have run into open space in front for a first down of him but lobbed a pass instead. The throw nearly went too far and Wingo had to make a leaping catch at the back of the end zone for the score. Manning said the win was the statement Texas needed to get in the playoff. “If you let us in, we can beat anyone,” Manning said. “If you don’t think we’re one of the best 12 teams in the country, I don’t know what to tell you.” Texas A&M: The Aggies could find no rally magic this time. The Aggies had the lead before the offense ground to a halt with three quick punts in the decisive third quarter. “Their front played a lot harder that ours,” Reed said. “They just had a better game plan in the second half for us.” Texas: A run game that has been missing most of the season erupted in the second half as Texas took control. Quintrevion Wiser rushed for a season-high 155 yards. Wisner rushed for 186 yards against Texas A&M last season. Reed left the game briefly in the first quarter when he rolled his left ankle making a cut on scramble and had to be helped off the field. He missed only one offensive play, but the Aggies’ drive stalled and ended in a field goal attempt that was blocked by Texas’ Ethan Burke. Texas A&M: Awaits the final CFP rankings on Dec. 7.

"Nick Sirianni says he won’t be changing the offensive playcaller","In Philly, it’s beginning to look a lot like 2023. But Eagles coach Nick Sirianni isn’t panicking. Even if he arguably should be. After Friday’s 24-15 loss to the Bears, Sirianni said he won’t be shifting the offensive playcalling duties away from coordinator Kevin Patullo. “We’re not changing the playcaller,” Sirianni said, via Tim McManus of ESPN.com. “But we will evaluate everything. It’s never just about one person. You win as a team, you lose as a team and you try to evaluate everything, win, lose or draw, and get better from it.” It’s hard to reconcile a vow to “evaluate everything” with a clear and firm decision to not change the playcaller. If everything is going to be evaluated, playcalling will be, too. And, as part of the evaluation, a change would be, in theory, possible. It’s becoming more and more clear that something is broken. And with two straight losses after an 8-2 start, the season is taking on the same vibe as it had two years ago, when a 10-1 start melted into five of six losses and a one-and-done postseason exit. Of course, changing the playcaller won’t matter if the issue is execution. In this regard, Derrick Gunn’s reporting from last week takes on specific relevance. If quarterback Jalen Hurts is freelancing, playcalling isn’t the issue. Whatever it is, the Eagles have a problem. The boo birds were out in full force on Friday. They have a few extra days before the Week 14 Monday night game at the Chargers. After that, the Eagles have a date with the woeful Raiders, two games against the listless Commanders, and a showdown with the Bills looms. The Eagles should win at least three of the final five games. The problem is, frankly, that the team that took the field on Friday doesn’t seem equipped to beat anyone. Whether that changes at this point is up to the Eagles. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Source: Lane Kiffin is lining up LSU staff","Mississippi coach Lane Kiffin has said he’ll make his decision on whether to stay put on Saturday. There’s a chance the decision has already been made. We’re told that Kiffin is lining up his coaching staff at LSU. It’s the kind of tidbit that quickly can spread on the coaching-industry grapevine, as folks agree to join someone’s staff — and as they decline the opportunity to do so. It’s no surprise. If Kiffin is seriously thinking about going, he’ll need to start getting people in place. And it gives him a chance to get a clean slate, leaving behind the folks from the Ole Miss staff that he either doesn’t want, or the ones who want to remain. This isn’t a report that Kiffin is leaving. We’ll leave that one to whoever gets the spoon-fed scoop. But it’s true that, as of Friday night, Kiffin is putting the pieces in place in the event he makes the leap to LSU. One way or the other, we’ll know what Kiffin is doing on Saturday. Unless he decides to take even more time to make the decision that he should have made by now. A Division of NBCUniversal.
