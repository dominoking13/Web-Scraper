"How to watch Fulham vs Manchester City live: Stream, TV channel, team news, prediction","Suddenly in-form Fulham host Manchester City at Craven Cottage on Tuesday in what should be an intriguing encounter. WATCH — Fulham v Manchester City Marco Silva’s side have won three of their last four games, including a big 2-1 win away at Spurs on Saturday. Fulham have struggled through the early months of the season but are now clicking through the gears as they aim for another season of challenging for a top 10 finish. Man City are stumbling around a little too as they coughed up a 2-0 lead at home to Leeds on Saturday but Phil Foden’s 91st-minute goal secured a 3-2 win. Pep Guardiola continues to rotate his lineup and with a win at Fulham his side can momentarily cut Arsenal’s lead atop the Premier League table to just two points. For live updates and highlights throughout Fulham vs Manchester City, check out PST’s live blog coverage below. Kick off time: 2:30pm ET Tuesday (December 2)Venue: Craven Cottage — West LondonTV Channel: USAStreaming: Watch live on NBC.com There are only two injury absentees for Fulham as Rodrigo Muniz and Antonee Robinson remain out. Chukwueze, Jimenez and Wilson were all very sharp against Spurs but Kevin, Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may come as Silva aims to keep his side fresh. City are still without Rodri as he continues to work his way back to full fitness, while Mateo Kovacic is still out for some time. Guardiola brought on Rayan Cherki and Omar Marmoush on against Leeds and they had a big impact, so maybe they start in this game to freshen things up? He also hinted he was going to chat with Erling Haaland about his fitness and if he needed to have a rest after a few games without a goal. This feels like it will be really tight but City will get the win they need to build some momentum, and Haaland will get back to scoring. Fulham 1-2 Manchester City. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Marcus Mariota: I loved the call to go for two, unfortunate we couldn’t convert","The Commanders lost 27-26 on Sunday night when a two-point conversion pass was knocked down on the last play of overtime. But quarterback Marucs Mariota says the call was a good one. Mariota said after the game that the offense was excited that coach Dan Quinn was putting the game on them. “I loved it. I don’t think there was any doubt in our minds across the board. I appreciate the confidence from Q. It was just unfortunate we were unable to convert,” Mariota said. Quinn said he knew from the start of overtime that if it came down to tying the game with an extra point or winning it with a two-point conversion, he’d go for the win. He also said the play that was called was a good one. Mariota had Jeremy McNichols open for the winning score, but Denver’s Nick Bonitto got in Mariota’s face, jumped up and swatted the ball away. “Going into the overtime spot I thought that would be the way we would go,” Quinn said. “That was the strategy all along. It was a play we like. It got batted down, but against man-to-man, that’s one that we practice a lot and we liked it. I hate the outcome, but there was no hesitation. I know when we started, we’re going to score and we’re going to go for two.” In a disappointing year in Washington, it was one more example of things that weren’t going right. The call was good, but the play didn’t work out. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Word circulates within Kentucky program that Chip Kelly could be next coach","The Raiders may be saving some of the money that would otherwise go to pay former offensive coordinator Chip Kelly’s buyout. Word is circulating among Kentucky players that Kelly could be the team’s next head coach. That doesn’t mean he will be. It doesn’t even mean he’s an official candidate. It means only that Kentucky players have somehow developed the impression that Kelly could be the new coach. Kentucky fired coach Mark Stoops on Sunday, after the conclusion of a 5-7 season. On Saturday, Stoops said there was a “zero percent chance” he’d walk away. He had coached the Wildcats since 2013. He had a record of 72-80. Kelly was the head coach at Oregon from 2009 through 2012. He coached the Eagles for three seasons and the 49ers for one year. After a year off in 2017, he coached UCLA from 2018 through 2023. He served as the Ohio State offensive coodinator in 2024, before being hired by the Raiders to a three-year contract with a reported value of $6 million per year. The Raiders fired Kelly last Sunday night. If the rumor currently making the rounds among Kentucky players is accurate, Kelly could be crash landing on his feet, quickly. A Division of NBCUniversal.
