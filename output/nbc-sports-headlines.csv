"Malik Nabers questions whether Giants “lose on purpose” with bad play calls","Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers suggested after watching his team lose to the Lions that the coaches could be tanking with bad play calls. Nabers, who is out for the season with a torn ACL, posted on social media that the Giants’ late play calling with a 27-24 lead made it look like they were purposely losing. The Giants led most of the game but lost to the Lions, 34-27 in overtime. “Sometimes I think they b makin us lose on purpose,” Nabers wrote, via ESPN. “Cause it’s no way, bro you throw the ball instead of running it to make em burn 2 timeouts?? then you dnt kick the field goal?? Then they have to go down and score!!! Football common sense!!!! Am I missing something?” Nabers later deleted the post without explanation. Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka certainly deserves scrutiny for his play calling on the sequence Nabers is referencing. The Giants had second-and-goal at the Lions’ 2-yard line with 3:11 left, and Kafka called a pass that fell incomplete, stopping the clock and saving the Lions a timeout. On third-and-goal, the Giants called a run to the outside that the Lions stopped for a four-yard loss. And then on fourth-and-goal from the 6-yard line, Kafka defied the analytics and common sense and went for it instead of kicking the field goal. The Giants threw another incompletion and the Lions took over on downs. From there the Lions were just barely able to drive into field goal range, send the game into overtime with a 59-yard field goal, and win the game in overtime. Better play calling from Kafka in the goal-to-go situation could have clinched a win for the Giants in regulation. The idea that Kafka is losing on purpose, however, doesn’t make a lot of sense. As an interim head coach, Kafka knows he’s auditioning for a head-coaching job, and pulling off an upset of the Lions would have bolstered his reputation. Kafka made some bad decisions down the stretch, but Nabers shouldn’t attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Teddy Bridgewater: If it’s my turn, I’ve just got to answer the bell","Buccaneers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater played his most extensive action in years on Sunday night after Baker Mayfield departed Tampa Bay’s eventual loss to the Rams with a left shoulder sprain. Bridgewater said in his postgame press conference that he arrived in Los Angeles at 10:30 Sunday morning separately from the team after attending a funeral in South Florida. He then went out and completed 8-of-15 passes for 62 yards in the second half on Sunday. Head coach Todd Bowles expressed confidence in Bridgewater should Mayfield need to miss time with his injury. Bridgewater noted he will be ready to go if called upon. “I’m very confident, and if it’s my turn, it’s my number, I’ve just got to answer the bell,” Bridgewater said, adding it would “definitely” make a difference with a full week of practice under his belt. Bridgewater said it’s unfortunate that his chance to play had to come from Mayfield’s injury. “But Bake’s a tough guy, man,” Bridgewater said. “He tried to come back out there today and tough it out for the guys, and that says a lot about him, says a lot about this team. “That’s the way Baker plays the game,” Bridgewater later added. “When it’s going well, everyone’s [saying], ‘Ah yeah.’ But then, when something bad happens, it’s, ‘Oh, Bake should’ve…’ Nah, that’s the way Bake plays the game. That’s what makes Bake special — his relentless effort every play. He tries to maximize every play. If it’s not there down the field, take off, try to run. He’ll do everything he can to lay it on the line for his team, and that’s all you can ask for from your guys.” Though Mayfield was ruled out, he did come back on the sideline during the third quarter in street clothes and with his left arm in a sling. “[He was] very calm, just making sure that I was good with the no-huddle signals, and the no-huddle calls,” Bridgewater said. “Still just being that leader that he is. So, I appreciate him for that.” We’ll see if Bridgewater will have to start next week when the Bucs host the Cardinals. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"No. 3 UCLA women dominate Southern 88-37 as season-opening win streak reaches 6 games","Mar 23, 2025; Los Angeles, California, USA; UCLA Bruins forward Angela Dugalic (32) during an NCAA Tournament second round game against the Richmond Spiders at Pauley Pavilion presented by Wescom. Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-Imagn Images Robert Hanashiro-Imagn Images LOS ANGELES (AP) — Angela Dugalic scored 20 points to lead four players in double figures and No. 3 UCLA routed Southern 88-37 on Sunday. The Bruins (6-0) tuned up for their second trip to Las Vegas in two weeks. They swept ranked North Carolina and South Florida in the WBCA Challenge last time. This week, they’ll face No. 4 Texas and play either No. 2 South Carolina or Duke in their other game. Kiki Rice added 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists, Lauren Betts had 15 points on 6-of-8 shooting and six rebounds and Lena Bilic hit four 3-pointers and finished with 14 points and six rebounds. DeMya Porter scored eight points to lead Southern (1-4) in its second visit to Pauley Pavilion this year. The Jaguars lost to the Bruins by 38 points in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in March, with UCLA advancing to the Final Four. The Bruins led 49-9 at halftime after shutting out the Jaguars 27-0 in the second quarter. It was UCLA’s first scoreless quarter since Dec. 5, 2021, against San Jose State. Their defense forced the Jaguars into missing all of their 13 shots while committing five turnovers and grabbing just four rebounds. In one sequence, Betts blocked a shot, Gabriela Jaquez stole the ball and Dugalic hit a 3-pointer, one of the four that she and Bilic combined to make in the second. UCLA outscored Southern 39-0 starting at the end of the first and ending early in the third. That’s when Jaylia Reed stopped the drought with a 3-pointer — her team’s second of the game. Southern managed 12 points in the third, when Dugalic scored UCLA’s final seven points for a 72-21 lead going into the fourth.
