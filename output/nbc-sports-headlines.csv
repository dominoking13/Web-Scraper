"‘On The Rise’ covers JuJu Watkins’ knee injury and the emotional fallout, family support","Even with some distance from the jarring incident, the injury that ended JuJu Watkins’ 2024-25 season remains difficult to process. “It’s hard for me to talk about,” USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said during an emotional interview months later. Just because in that moment it didn’t feel like it was normal. (Wiping away tears.) She gets carried off, and then what happened in this building is just an emotional response I’ve never felt in any way before. The fourth and final episode of the second season in the “On The Rise: JuJu Watkins” documentary series focuses on the aftermath of Watkins tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee during the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Watkins was driving for a transition basket against Mississippi State when she made contact with an opposing player and fell hard while clutching at her knee and grimacing in pain.

Mandatory Credit: Robert Hanashiro-Imagn Images Robert Hanashiro-Imagn Images “I went through the process,” Watkins said, describing the injury in the documentary. “I got my MRI, drove back to Galen, got the news. And then ... yeah. I tore my ACL. And that was it. Yeah.” Two days later, the USC superstar was on crutches while getting an impromptu pep talk from family that gathered at her house to show support and offer words of encouragement. Cousin Tracey Mills said, “this journey is going to force her more than ever to go deeper within and understand her purpose.” “You’re not really thinking like you get hurt, and everyone in your community is sharing that pain with you,” said Sari Watkins, JuJu’s mother. “It’s a big testament to humanity.” JuJu initially thought she needed “to be in my room with the blinds closed, seeing them lifted my spirits. They know what I need.” A knee operation to repair the ACL would follow two weeks later, with relatives again by her side. “Scared but happy to get it over with, I guess,” said JuJu, who prayed with her family before her first major surgery. “I know you’re frustrated; it’s OK to drop a tear,” said Janine Watkins, JuJu’s grandmother. “But you’re going to be OK. You’re going to be just fine. You didn’t leave nothing on the table. You’re not a greedy person, but you didn’t leave nothing for them.” The episode also tracks the early stages of a painstaking recovery for Watkins, who undergoes physical therapy six days per week. The regimen includes lots of time in the pool as she relearns how to walk with weight on the leg. “I’m tackling that like I would anything on the court,” she said. “It’s hard to not wish things were different, but I think it’s for the better. The goal is to be a better payer and person.” The second season of “On The Rise” ends on an upbeat note as Watkins receives myriad player of the year awards (“To be recognized after everything happened was bittersweet. A mixture of emotions.“) and serves as the winning coach in a girls basketball exhibition event (“I’m not really the most social person, so that requires me to step out of comfort zone and be more outgoing.”). Having already announced she will miss this season while completing a knee rehabilitation that will take nine to 12 months, Watkins is fully focused on a strong return in 2026 for her senior year at USC and a WNBA career. “I believe everything happens for a reason,” she said.

"Pryce Sandfort scores 21 for Nebraska in Hall of Fame Classic win over Kansas State, 86-85","KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Pryce Sandfort scored 21 points and Reink Mast added 20 for Nebraska in an 86-85 victory over Kansas State on Friday night, winning the Hall of Fame Classic for the first time in program history. Nebraska (6-0) went on a 15-0 run in the first half to lead 19-7. Kansas State (5-1) clawed its way back to close the gap to 45-35 at halftime. The Wildcats took the lead with 7:51 to go in the second half, and Nebraska responded every time Kansas State tried to push in front. With 2:28 to go Sandfort sank a 3-pointer to put the Cornhuskers up 81-80. PJ Haggerty hit a jumper and a free throw for the Wildcats, but Sam Hoiberg and Mast scored layups to put Nebraska up two.

"Azzi Fudd and Syla Swords’ epic shooting display ends with UConn coming away with 72-69 victory","UNCASVILLE, Conn. — Azzi Fudd and Syla Swords went shot-for-shot in an early season showdown between two of the top teams in the country. The top-ranked UConn Huskies came away with one more play for the hard-fought win. Fudd scored 31 points for UConn and Swords had 29 for Michigan in the Huskies’ 72-69 victory over the sixth-ranked Wolverines on Friday night in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Women’s Showcase. “Those are two of hte best shooters in the country playing tongiht against each other,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “They both put on quite a show. It’s not easy for them to get those shots and they seemed to be able to make shots other people had a hard time making.” With former UConn men’s great Ray Allen sitting courtside, Fudd scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, hitting three straight 3-pointers in her own personal 9-0 run with her team on the brink of collapse, nearly blowing a 17-point lead. “I think the only thing going through my mind was to be aggressive, knew we needed to get a bucket,” Fudd said. “I was proud how we stuck together and we figured it out in the end.” Swords, a sophomore guard for the Wolverines, wouldn’t let her team go away quietly, hitting three 3-pointers of her own in the last minute — the final one getting Michigan to 70-69 with just over 12 seconds left. She finished the night making eight 3s. “I think once you get a good player going they can feel it and a team has a certain momentum,” Auriemma said. “They just needed an opportunity to shoot it and it’s a good chance it will go in.” Fudd, who made seven 3s, hit four free throws down the stretch to seal the victory. “Great back and forth and I’m glad the country got to see her game on full display,” Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico said of her star sophomore. “It was incredible. We’ve seen Syla do that through her time with us. She took over the game. Her playing in the Olympics, her being on that international stage, her playing with her national team. She was leading in every single thing down the stretch.” Barnes Arico is no stranger to UConn’s greatest, having coached against the Huskies for many years when she was at St. John’s. She pulled off a stunning victory in her last year with the Red Storm, ending UConn’s 99-game home winning streak in 2012. “I thought we might do it again tonight,” she said when her team rallied in the second-half . Auriemma was left impressed by the Wolverines. “I told Kim before the game, I thought this was the best team she ever had, they are really, really good,” the Hall of Fame coach said. “I told her after the game, I told you. She didn’t belive me before the game.” A Division of NBCUniversal. DISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.
