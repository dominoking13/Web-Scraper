"Buccaneers expect Chris Godwin to return tonight vs. Rams","For just the third time this season, the Buccaneers will have wide receiver Chris Godwin on the field tonight. Although Godwin is officially listed as questionable against the Rams, the Bucs are expecting him to play on Sunday Night Football, according to multiple reports. Godwin has missed 19 of the Buccaneers’ last 21 games. Last year he missed the final 11 games with an ankle injury, and after he was finally cleared to play in Week Four of this year, he played in just two games before suffering a leg injury that has kept him out until now. The emergence of rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka as the Buccaneers’ best offensive playmaker has gone a long way toward keeping the Bucs’ passing game going as both Godwin and Mike Evans have missed most of the season. But having Godwin back tonight will help. The Buccaneers are seven-point underdogs tonight in Los Angeles in a battle of NFC division leaders. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Ty Johnson draws $10,777 fine for “obscene gesture” touchdown celebration","After scoring a touchdown on a 52-yard catch and run against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Bills running back Ty Johnson initially grabbed his hamstring, pretending to be injured. He then fell to the ground and, well, did enough to get fined for an obscene gesture. It was basically “two pumps.” Into the turf. The price tag for the “obscene gesture” is $10,777. It was similar to the move that got Lions receiver Jameson Williams fined after a long touchdown run during Detroit’s 2024 playoff loss to the Commanders. While there’s no specific name for this type of celebration, it’s like Potter Stewart once said. You know it when you see it. And the league saw it. Which got Johnson fined for it.

"Justin Jefferson still has J.J. McCarthy’s back","Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy will start his sixth career game on Sunday, at Green Bay. He has thrown at least one interception in each of them. If McCarthy throws another on Sunday, he’ll be only the fourth quarterback in the past twenty years to throw an interception in each of his first six starts, joining Zach Mettenberger, Blake Bortles, and Deshone Kizer. Receiver Justin Jefferson still believes in McCarthy. “He’s a great player,” Jefferson said this week, via Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com. “He’s a great quarterback. He’s a great kid. So at the end of the day, it’s all about going out there and just relying on everybody to do their jobs and just going out there and just doing it. And of course people get involved with the media and you hear so much different negativity out in the world. “So I’m always going to be that person for J.J. to always lean on and talk to about any of that type of stuff, and I’m always going to be that person to motivate him to always continue to be better, regardless if he’s my quarterback or not.” McCarthy will be Jefferson’s quarterback for at least the rest of the year. Come 2026, who knows? (The Mac Jones talk is already out there.) Wherever it does from here, the Vikings need more from McCarthy. Jefferson does, too. He’s averaging 54.0 yards per game when McCarthy plays. During the Carson Wentz tenure earlier this year, Jefferson averaged 95.4 yards per game. The next chance comes at Lambeau Field against the Packers on Sunday. If the 4-6 Vikings are going to turn around a season that is slipping away, now would be a good time to kick things into gear.
