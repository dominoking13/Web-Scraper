Mikel Arteta’s much-changed Arsenal were professional in their 2-0 home win against Brentford on Wednesday as they kept their five-point lead atop the table with minimum fuss. Arsenal have struggled against Villa in recent seasons and with injuries piling up, it will be intriguing to see if squad players keep on stepping up. For live updates and highlights throughout Aston Villa vs Arsenal check out PST’s live blog coverage below. Kick off time: 7:30am ET Saturday (December 6)Venue: Villa Park — Aston, BirminghamTV Channel: USAStreaming: Watch live on NBC.com Emiliano Martinez pulled out of the win at Brighton in the warm up and despite an early mistake for Brighton’s opener, Marco Bizot came in and made a big stop late on to secure the win. Ollie Watkins scored a double and looked sharp, while Villa have an impressive array of options in midfield and attack. Only Ross Barkley and Tyrone Mings are out with injuries. Declan Rice hobbled off late on against Brentford but it seems like he will be fine, while Cristhian Mosquera had to be subbed off in the first half as Arsenal lost another center back to injury with William Saliba and Gabriel still out. That means Jurrien Timber could line up at center back with Ben White at right back. Kai Havertz and Leandro Trossard are still out, while Gabriel Jesus has been on the bench and is working his way back to fitness after a long time out. Arteta rotated heavily against Brentford but the likes of Saka, Eze, Timber and Gyokeres should all start in this one. This feels like a draw and Arsenal will probably be okay with this given how much their squad has been stretched in recent weeks. Aston Villa 1-1 Arsenal. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Broncos are second team in NFL history to win four straight games by three points or less","The Broncos are winning close games at a historic pace. Denver’s last four games were an 18-15 win over Houston, a 10-7 win over Las Vegas, a 22-19 win over Kansas City and a 27-26 win over Washington. That’s four consecutive games won by three or fewer points, and that’s something only one other team in NFL history has accomplished. The other team to do it was the 1986 New York Giants, who won games by scores of 17-14, 17-14, 22-20 and 19-16 during a four-game stretch. Sometimes when teams win a lot of close games, it’s an indication that they’re just skating by and are not as good as their record suggests. But in the case of those 1986 Giants, they finished the regular season 14-2 and ended up winning the Super Bowl. Broncos fans would like to think their team is on a similar trajectory. The Broncos also beat the Jets 13-11 in Week Six and the Giants 33-32 in Week Seven, so they have a total of six wins this season by three or less. If the Broncos win one more game by three or fewer points, they’ll join the 2003 Panthers and 1998 Cardinals as the only teams in NFL history with seven wins by three points or less. Broncos quarterback Bo Nix has started every game since he was drafted last year, and the Broncos are 20-9 in those games. If the Broncos run the table and win all five of their remaining games, Nix will surpass Russell Wilson, who won 24 games in his first two NFL seasons, as the quarterback with the most wins in his first two seasons in NFL history. The Broncos are 7.5-point favorites against the Raiders on Sunday. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Cristhian Mosquera, Declan Rice injury news: Mikel Arteta update as Arsenal lose center back; Rice also off","Arsenal are cursing their bad luck with injuries to center backs, and Gunners fans will be sweating on the latest Cristhian Mosquera injury news and an issue with Declan Rice too. As for Mosquera, the Spanish center back had to go off injured in the first half of their 2-0 win against Brentford on Wednesday after appearing to suffer an ankle injury as he landed awkwardly. With their two starting center backs William Saliba and Gabriel already watching from the stands due to injury, Mikel Arteta did not want to lose Mosquera to injury. Mosquera walked off on his own with Jurrien Timber coming on in his place at center back and Ben White at right back. Star midfielder Declan Rice also went off with an injury in the second half, as he walked off the pitch but was pointing at his right calf after receiving some treatment. Speaking after the game, Mikel Arteta said the following about Cristhian Mosquera’s injury and an update on Declan Rice. “We will know more tomorrow. Let’s see how they are. Obviously they need to be tested. Declan had to come off. Let’s see and have a look,” Arteta said. Arteta added this on Mosquera after the game: “We have to wait and see. It’s probably the knee or ankle. We don’t know. He could not really tell us exactly how it was, but he wasn’t able to continue.” And he didn’t add much more detail on Rice: “He could not carry on playing, so we have to wait and see tomorrow what happens.” Rice himself told Sky Sports News he was “fine” as he walked through the mixed zone after the game, so it seems like he’s escaped any big issue. Some Arsenal fans aren’t happy that Rice started yet again but it’s pretty easy to say that now. He’s been so influential to their long unbeaten run, Arsenal were without their two starting center backs so needed defensive solidity and the injury issue didn’t seem too serious.

"Roger Goodell says NFL is considering a second Black Friday game","Yes, the NFL will keep looking for ways to stuff more cheese into the pizza crust. And more cash into the coffers. Via Sam Neumann of AwfulAnnouncing.com, Commissioner Roger Goodell recently told Joe Flint of the Wall Street Journal that the NFL is considering adding a second Black Friday game, among other potential schedule changes. The Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 prohibits the NFL from televising games on Saturdays or after 6:00 p.m. ET on Fridays from the second weekend in September through the second weekend in December. That was the quid pro quo for the extremely valuable broadcast antitrust exemption. Under current federal law, a consecutive Black Friday doubleheader would have to be completed by 6:00 p.m. ET. The first game would have to start by noon ET, at the latest. An overlapping doubleheader could have one game start at 1:30 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. ET, with the second kicking off at 3:00 p.m. ET. Then there’s the possibility of working the current Congress and administration for an expanded exception to the SBA. How much would a Black Friday night game hurt high-school football? By late November, every state has made it to the postseason. Folks can attend the local playoff game while monitoring the NFL game on their phones. Alternatively, the NFL could swing for the fences and try to get rid of the Friday/Saturday prohibition entirely, unlocking the possibility for Friday night and Saturday night games on a regular basis. Regardless, it’s clear that the NFL wants more standalone windows. It’s still surprising that the league has yet to make Tuesday and/or Wednesday night football a thing, especially after the pandemic showed that such games can be scheduled. At some point, the Sunday afternoon packages would become excessively diluted. That problem can be solved with expansion. Which feels increasingly inevitable. One thing is certain. People like to watch football. Many would watch a game every night of the week. It’s foolish not to think the league would love to let us. A Division of NBCUniversal.

"Sean Payton is “hopeful” Bill Belichick returns to the NFL","Bill Belichick is a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Another coach who’s laying the foundation for a bronze bust of his own hopes Belichick will return to pro football. “I’ll be honest with you, I miss him not being in the league,” Broncos coach Sean Payton told reporters on Wednesday. “I miss him not being in the league, and I wouldn’t be surprised, and I would be somewhat hopeful that he ends up back in the league. We’d all be better for it. He’s something.” Belichick’s buyout costs a miniscule, for NFL owners, $1 million. But there’s no clear indication that anyone would want to hire him, given the latter years of his time in New England (which included putting a defensive coach in charge of the offense), the pettiness he and his consigliere, Mike Lombardi, have displayed toward the Patriots specifically and the NFL generally, his 2025 performance at North Carolina, the baggage and distractions he’d bring with him in a return to the pro game, and his reputation for hoping to take over the entire football operation in lieu of simply coaching the team. Belichick should have a no-debate, no-brainer case for Canton. He should automatically gain entry. He’s one of the greatest coaches in NFL history. Failure to put him in immediately would undermine the credibility of the entire selection process. That doesn’t mean Belichick currently is a viable candidate to become an NFL head coach. Still, 31 teams can say “no way.” It only takes one to whisper, “Why not?” The college game clearly isn’t for Belichick. For plenty of pro teams that haven’t won many games in recent years, they could do a lot worse than Belichick. And they have. It nevertheless feels like an uphill climb. Which creates an interesting irony. It will be much easier for Belichick to gain a spot among the all-time immortals than it will be for him to get another opportunity to coach one of the NFL’s franchises. A Division of NBCUniversal.
