"FAU Engineers Create Smarter AI to Redefine Control in Complex Systems","A new artificial intelligence breakthrough developed by researchers in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University offers a smarter, more efficient way to manage complex systems that rely on multiple decision-makers operating at different levels of authority. This novel framework, recently published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems, could significantly impact the future of smart energy grids, traffic networks and autonomous vehicle systems – technologies that are becoming increasingly central to daily life. In many real-world systems, decisions don’t happen simultaneously or equally. A utility company might decide when to cut power during peak hours, and households must adjust their energy use in response. In traffic systems, central controllers dictate signals while vehicles adapt accordingly. “These types of systems operate under a power hierarchy, where one player makes the first move and others must follow, and they’re more complicated than typical AI models assume,” said Zhen Ni, Ph.D., senior author, IEEE senior member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Traditional AI methods often treat every decision-maker as equal, operating at the same time with the same level of influence. While this makes for clean simulations, it doesn’t reflect how decisions are actually made in real-world scenarios – especially in environments full of uncertainty, limited bandwidth and uneven access to information.” To address this, Ni and Xiangnan Zhong, Ph.D., first author, IEEE member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, designed a new AI framework based on reinforcement learning, a technique that allows intelligent agents to learn from interacting with their environment over time. Their approach adds two key innovations. First, it structures the decision-making process using a game theory model called the Stackelberg-Nash game, where a “leader” agent acts first and “follower” agents respond in an optimal way. This hierarchy better mirrors systems like energy management, connected transportation and autonomous driving. Second, the researchers introduced an event-triggered mechanism that reduces the computational burden. “Instead of constantly updating decisions at every time step, which is typical of many AI systems, our method updates decisions only when necessary, saving energy and processing power while maintaining performance and stability,” said Zhong. The result is a system that not only handles the power asymmetry between decision-makers but also deals with mismatched uncertainties – cases where different players operate with varying levels of information and predictability. This is especially critical in environments like smart grids or traffic control systems, where conditions change rapidly and resources are often limited. The framework allows for a more robust, adaptive and scalable form of AI control that can make better use of limited bandwidth and computing resources. “This work fills a crucial gap in the current AI landscape. By developing a method that reflects real-world decision hierarchies and adapts to imperfect information, Professors Zhong and Ni are helping us move closer to practical, intelligent systems that can handle the complexity of our modern infrastructure,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “The implications of this research are far-reaching. Whether it’s optimizing power consumption across cities or making autonomous systems more reliable, this kind of innovation is foundational to the future of intelligent technology. It represents a step forward not just for AI research, but for the everyday systems we depend on.” Backed by rigorous theoretical analysis and validated through simulation studies, Zhong and Ni demonstrated that their event-triggered reinforcement learning method maintains system stability, ensures optimal strategy outcomes and effectively reduces unnecessary computation. The approach combines deep control theory with practical machine learning, offering a compelling path forward for intelligent control in asymmetric, uncertain environments. Two related journal articles have recently been published on IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence as well. The research work is mainly supported by the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Transportation. The research team is now working on expanding their model for larger-scale testing in real-world scenarios. Their long-term vision is to integrate this AI framework into operational systems that power cities, manage traffic and coordinate fleets of autonomous machines – bringing the promise of smarter infrastructure one step closer to reality.

"Decoding a Decade of Grouper Grunts Unlocks Spawning Secrets, Shifts","More than a decade of acoustic recordings of grouper grunts are providing new insight into how sound can be used to monitor and manage vulnerable fish populations. The research by Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute focused on the red hind (Epinephelus guttatus), a commercially important Caribbean grouper species. Red hind are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as females and later becoming males. Each winter, they travel more than 30 kilometers to offshore sites to spawn under the full moon in large gatherings. Males use rhythmic, low-frequency sounds to attract mates and to defend territory. This predictable behavior makes them especially vulnerable to overfishing during spawning season. Rather than traditional survey methods, FAU Harbor Branch and FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science researchers, in collaboration with HJR Reefscaping, the University of the Virgin Islands, and the University of Puerto Rico, turned to passive acoustic monitoring. This technique enables continuous, long-term monitoring of reproductive behavior, even in remote or hard-to-access areas, without disrupting the animals or their habitat. To examine how red hind reproductive behavior has changed over time, researchers analyzed more than 2,000 hours of underwater recordings from a single spawning site off Puerto Rico’s west coast, continuously monitored since 2007. Unlike most acoustic studies that track general sound levels, this research focused on specific mating calls tied to distinct behaviors. Red hind produce two primary sound types – one for courtship and another for territorial defense. Tracking these sounds over time allowed researchers to detect subtle shifts in spawning behavior and population dynamics. The result, published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, is one of the most extensive and uninterrupted acoustic datasets ever assembled for a reef fish species. The analysis confirmed a consistent seasonal pattern in red hind spawning activity, closely aligned with lunar cycles. However, one of the most striking findings was a notable shift in the balance of call types over the 12-year period. Between 2011 and 2017, calls linked to courtship were more common. But starting in 2018, calls linked to competition and territorial behavior became dominant – nearly tripling over the study period. “This shift could indicate changes in the population, such as an increase in the number of older or more dominant males, changes in sex ratios, or even a shift in the core spawning area,” said Laurent Chérubin, Ph.D., lead author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch. Researchers also observed more frequent and multiple peaks in sound production in recent years, suggesting that spawning may now be spread over more days in each lunar cycle than in the past. These changes could be responses to environmental or population shifts. Importantly, the study shows that passive acoustic monitoring can be a powerful tool for tracking reproductive behavior over time and detecting early signs of population or behavioral change – information that is critical for managing and conserving red hind and similar reef fish species. “What’s remarkable is that even a single underwater microphone can reveal so much about fish populations,” said Chérubin. “With consistent long-term monitoring, we can pick up early warning signs – like shifts in spawning behavior or population stress – and give resource managers the information they need to adapt conservation strategies before it’s too late.” At the center of the analysis was an advanced machine-learning tool called FADAR (fish acoustic detection algorithm research). This custom-built acoustic classifier allowed the team to detect and distinguish between different types of mating calls with extraordinary speed and accuracy. “This study shows how much we can learn simply by listening,” said Chérubin. “Thanks to FADAR, we processed 12 years of acoustic data in weeks – uncovering patterns that would have taken years to find. It’s a game changer for monitoring and managing reef fish like red hind.” “As passive acoustics advances, it’s transforming our understanding of the ocean,” said Chérubin. “By tuning in to underwater soundscapes, we’re discovering not just when and where fish spawn, but how those patterns change over time – offering vital insights into the health of marine ecosystems.” Study co-authors are Caroline Woodward, United States Geological Survey; Michelle Schärer-Umpierre, Ph.D., associate researcher, HJR Reefscaping and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez; Richard S. Nemeth, Ph.D., research professor, Center for Marine and Environmental Studies, University of the Virgin Islands; Richard Appeldoorn, Ph.D., a faculty member; and Evan Tuhoy, a Ph.D. candidate, both within the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Puerto Rico; and Ali K. Ibrahim, Ph.D., a research engineer in FAU’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Each winter, red hind groupers gather under the full moon, grunting low-frequency calls to attract mates and defend territory. Researchers used acoustic passive monitoring to detect their grunts by deploying specialized underwater microphones via the autonomous wave glider, a device they developed themselves. A group of red hind groupers, which produce sounds associated with courtship, territoriality and mating.

"FAU/Baptist Health AI Spine Model Could Transform Back Pain Treatment","Nearly 3 in 10 adults in the United States have experienced lower back pain in any three-month period, making it the most common musculoskeletal pain. Back pain remains one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting millions and often leading to chronic discomfort, missed work and invasive procedures. Researchers and clinicians are increasingly turning to lumbar spine modeling, which bridges engineering and medicine, creating a virtual, patient-specific model of the lower back. This technology simulates how the spine moves, where mechanical stress builds up, and what might be causing pain or dysfunction. These detailed models are used to plan surgeries, evaluate spinal implants and develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to each patient’s anatomy. Despite its promise, current lumbar spine modeling is slow, manual and demands specialized expertise, limiting scalability and personalization. This hinders clinical application and results in inconsistent outcomes. Researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University and the Marcus Neuroscience Institute at Boca Raton Regional Hospital, part of Baptist Health, have reached a major milestone in lumbar spine modeling by integrating artificial intelligence with biomechanics to transform spine diagnostics and personalized treatment planning. They are the first to create a fully automated finite element analysis pipeline specifically for lumbar spine modeling. Their breakthrough involves integrating deep learning tools like nnUNet and MONAI with biomechanical simulators such as GIBBON and FEBio. Results of the study, published in the journal World Neurosurgery, show that this new approach reduced lumbar spine model preparation time by 97.9% – from more than 24 hours to just 30 minutes and 49 seconds – without compromising biomechanical accuracy. The fully automated pipeline enables rapid, patient-specific simulations that support preoperative planning, spinal implant optimization and early detection of degenerative spine conditions. Tests showed that the virtual spine reacted just like a real one, with realistic disc movement, ligament tension and pressure in the back of the spine during bending and stretching. Because the system runs with very little manual work, it’s much faster and more consistent than traditional methods, making it a valuable tool for doctors and researchers alike. “What sets our approach apart is its ability to automatically convert standard medical images like CT or MRI scans into highly accurate, patient-specific spine models,” said Maohua Lin, Ph.D., corresponding author and a research assistant professor, FAU Department of Biomedical Engineering. “Traditional manual methods require complex geometry processing, meshing and finite element simulation setup, making them not only time-intensive but also highly dependent on the operator’s expertise. Our automated pipeline significantly reduces the time required, cutting what once took several hours or even days down to just minutes.” For the study, researchers used advanced AI to automatically identify important parts of the spine – like bones and discs – from medical scans. These were then turned into smooth 3D models that included bones, cartilage and ligaments. They mapped where the ligaments attach and shaped the cartilage based on common patterns. Lastly, researchers ran computer simulations to see how the spine responds to movements like bending and twisting, helping them understand where stress builds up and how the spine moves in real life. “Beyond advancing research, automated lumbar spine modeling plays a critical role in preoperative planning,” said Frank D. Vrionis, M.D., corresponding author and chief of neurosurgery at Marcus Neuroscience Institute. “This technology quickly generates patient-specific models to predict mechanical complications, optimize implant design and reduce surgical risks. By removing manual steps, it also improves speed and consistency, helping clinicians make more informed decisions.” This research builds upon previous work by the research team published in leading journals including Artificial Intelligence Review and the North American Spine Society Journal, investigating related AI-driven biomechanical modeling techniques. “This groundbreaking work exemplifies the game-changing power of uniting engineering and medicine to address complex health care challenges,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science. “FAU and Baptist Health researchers are not only pushing the boundaries of innovation, they are also delivering real-world solutions that can improve patient outcomes and redefine spine care.” This research was supported by Boca Raton Regional Hospital, part of Baptist Health, the Helene and Stephen Weicholz Foundation, the National Science Foundation, pilot grants from the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science, the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, the FAU Center for Smart Health, and the FAU Sensing Institute.

"FAU Engineering Awarded USDA Grant for Smart Farming Breakthrough","Arslan Munir, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science within the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, has received an $827,533 grant from the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture. This award will support Munir’s leadership of a groundbreaking, multi-institutional research project with FAU, Kansas State University and Purdue University, aimed at revolutionizing the future of precision agriculture through the development of an advanced edge/fog computing-based framework – called “FogAg” – to enable real-time, multi-layer sensing and analysis of how water and nitrogen levels together affect crop growth and yield. Agriculture faces mounting pressure to feed a growing population while protecting natural resources. Managing water and nitrogen – two vital yet often limiting crop inputs – is one of the greatest challenges. When mismanaged, they can reduce yields and harm the environment through runoff and waste. Existing smart agriculture tools often fall short in capturing and responding to these complex interactions in real time with the precision farmers need. Munir’s FogAg framework is designed to fill this technological and scientific gap. By integrating cutting-edge developments in edge/fog computing, cyber-physical systems, and multi-modal sensing, the project offers a scalable solution that can provide actionable insights into plant-soil dynamics. The research will explore new innovations across multiple domains – including architecture, sensing, machine learning and predictive modeling – to deliver a next-generation agricultural system that can interpret and respond to field data in near real-time. “Receiving this USDA grant is an important milestone in our pursuit of transformative agricultural technologies,” said Munir. “Our goal with FogAg is to create an intelligent, adaptable and energy-efficient framework that empowers farmers with the data they need to make timely, site-specific decisions. By capturing and analyzing the nuanced interactions between water and nitrogen stressors, we aim to not only increase crop yield and quality but also reduce the environmental impact of modern agriculture. This project represents our deep commitment to leveraging advanced computing systems in service of sustainable food production.” At the heart of FogAg is a novel, three-tiered cyber-physical architecture that spans IoT devices, fog computing nodes and cloud servers, enabling distributed processing and near real-time analytics. Supporting this architecture is Neuro-Sense, a reconfigurable system that facilitates energy-efficient signal and image processing for dynamically changing workloads in the field. The team will develop and deploy a multi-modal sensing platform that includes an economical and flexible LED-based multispectral imaging system, an innovative near-infrared point measurement sensor, and a novel frequency response-based dielectric soil sensor. “These tools will enable sensing above, below and within the plant canopy, capturing a comprehensive picture of crop and soil health,” said Munir. On the data processing front, the project will leverage advanced machine learning techniques, including a highly efficient convolutional neural network accelerator capable of analyzing complex image and sensor data streams. These insights will feed into tree-based predictive models that integrate real-time and historical data to generate site-specific, variable-rate prescriptions for fertilizer and irrigation – maximizing productivity while minimizing input waste. Beyond its scientific and technical contributions, the FogAg project is poised to make significant societal and environmental impacts. The integration of real-time water and nitrogen management strategies will not only enhance resource-use efficiency and reduce production costs but also help lower agriculture’s nitrogen footprint and associated environmental pollution. With both spatial and temporal scalability, the framework has potential applications ranging from large-scale industrial farms to urban and peri-urban agricultural systems. “This research epitomizes the kind of forward-thinking, impact-driven innovation at Florida Atlantic University,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “Professor Munir’s work is a great example of how engineering can lead transformative change in critical sectors like agriculture. The integration of smart technologies into farming practices not only addresses urgent global challenges around food security and sustainability but also reinforces our role as a leader in cross-disciplinary research with real-world impact.” In addition to its research agenda, the project will incorporate its findings into both undergraduate and graduate curricula, training the next generation of engineers and scientists in the practical application of smart agriculture technologies. This educational component ensures that the knowledge generated through the FogAg project will have lasting influence, seeding innovation well beyond the duration of the grant. Munir will be working closely with co-investigators Michell L. Neilsen, Ph.D.; Naiqian Zhang, Ph.D.; Paul Armstrong, Ph.D.; and Rachel L.V. Cott, Ph.D.; representing the departments of computer science, biological and agricultural engineering and agronomy at Kansas State University; as well as Ignacio Ciampitti, Ph.D., Department of Agronomy from Purdue University.
