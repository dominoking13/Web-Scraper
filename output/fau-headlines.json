    "content": "A bonnethead shark – the pint-sized cousin of hammerhead sharks. STUDY SNAPSHOT: What gives shark skin its unique toughness and smooth, hydrodynamic edge? The secret lies in dermal denticles – tiny, tooth-like scales made of the same material as our teeth. These microscopic armor plates don’t just make sharks sleek swimmers; they also shield their bodies from damage. But how do these denticles change as sharks grow – and do male and female sharks have different designs? Researchers dove deep into these questions by studying bonnethead sharks, close relatives of hammerheads. Using electron microscopy, they captured incredibly detailed images of the sharks’ skin, analyzing how denticle shape, size, and texture evolve across different life stages. Their findings revealed that as sharks mature, their denticles develop more ridges and change in orientation – enhancements that likely improve swimming efficiency and protection. Interestingly, while researchers expected major differences between the sexes, they found only one: males had slightly steeper ridge angles. This research not only sheds light on how sharks are built for survival and reproduction but could also inspire future innovations in swimwear and biomimetic design. Have you ever wondered what makes shark skin so tough and sleek? It’s dermal denticles – tiny, tooth-like structures that cover a shark’s skin. Made of the same material as teeth and shaped like small scales with grooves, these microscopic armor plates aren’t just for show. Dermal denticles serve important roles in helping sharks glide effortlessly, and protect their skin, especially during mating. Although much is known, researchers still lack a full understanding of how dermal denticle shape changes across different parts of the shark’s body as it grows and if there are differences between males and females. To solve this mystery, researchers from Florida Atlantic University turned to high-resolution imaging to examine bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) – the pint-sized cousins of hammerhead sharks. Using advanced scanning electron microscopy, they were able to capture detailed images of the sharks’ skin, focusing on minute features like denticle shape, size and ridge patterns – details far too small to be seen with standard microscopes. The team studied skin samples from 24 bonnethead sharks across various life stages. These sharks were an ideal subject, as their skin denticles undergo noticeable changes as they grow and show distinct features between males and females, especially in areas linked to mating. Findings, published in the journal Integrative and Comparative Biology, provide an ultra-magnified peek into the hidden world of shark skin, revealing how evolution fine-tunes this natural armor for survival and reproduction. Results of the study showed that denticle morphology changes significantly as bonnethead sharks mature, supporting the idea that these changes improve swimming efficiency and skin protection. Younger sharks had fewer ridges on the denticles, less overlap between them, and smaller ridge angles compared to older sharks. However, the overall length of the denticles stayed about the same at all stages. These changes likely help sharks swim better and protect their skin as they mature. “Shark skin is far more dynamic than people realize,” said Marianne E. Porter, Ph.D., senior author and an associate professor of biological sciences in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Our study shows that as bonnethead sharks grow, their skin doesn’t just get bigger – it transforms in ways that improve swimming performance and provide greater protection. These changes help reduce drag in the water and strengthen the skin against physical challenges like predators or mating-related injuries. It’s a remarkable example of how nature fine-tunes biological structures to meet the changing demands of an animal’s life.” Although previous studies found that female sharks often have thicker, tougher skin with higher denticle density – possibly to protect against male bites during mating – this study found minimal differences between the sexes. The only denticle trait that showed sexual dimorphism was ridge angle, which was slightly larger in males. There were also no significant differences in denticle features across the dorsal, medial and ventral parts of the abdominal region studied. “This research is relevant because gaining an understanding of the developmental aspects of a shark’s dermal denticles can provide extraordinary insights into their evolutionary role in facilitating survival locomotion and reproductive materials,” said Hannah Epstein, corresponding author, a recent graduate of FAU High School and a current student in FAU’s Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College. “We can also apply these quantifications of shark skin to other fields, such as bioengineering, to specifically design materials that can help someone swim faster, just as denticles help a shark swim faster.” The patterns observed in this study mirrors findings in other species, such as Portuguese dogfish sharks, which have 11 different denticle shapes that appear at different developmental stages. Past research has also shown that juveniles tend to have smaller denticles than adults, a trend that held true for bonnethead sharks in this study. “The advanced imaging and analysis tools we have at the Marcus Research and Innovation Center were essential for this research,” said Tricia Meredith, Ph.D., co-author, director of research for Florida Atlantic Laboratory Schools, and an assistant research professor in FAU’s College of Education. “Using scanning electron microscopy and precise morphometric software allowed us to see and measure the tiny details of shark denticles like never before. This technology opens up new possibilities to understand how these structures function and evolve, giving us a clearer picture of shark biology and biomechanics.” The Berlin Family Bioimaging Lab is a one-of-a-kind research laboratory that provides students access to high-tech equipment to work on complex research projects, including cancer treatment research, vaccine development, and prosthetic creation, among others. Students like Epstein can research some of the world’s most challenging problems at an early age and can share that research and publish it in peer-reviewed journals. The lab includes a micro computed tomography scanner; scanning electron microscope; histology suite; inverted compound microscope; and stereoscope and is available to researchers of all levels at FAU. Study co-author is Madeleine E. Hagood, a Ph.D. student of integrative biology at FAU. The research was supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER Award grant, awarded to Porter, and an FAU Office of Undergraduate Research and Inquiry grant awarded to Epstein.

    "headline": "FAU Lands $3M Federal Grant to Prevent Substance Use in At-risk Youth",
    "content": "The five-year project will strengthen substance use prevention among more than 3,000 South Florida youth. Florida Atlantic University has received a $3 million, five-year grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, to lead a transformative community initiative designed to prevent substance use among South Florida’s youth. The new program, “Rising Strong: Empowering Youth for Substance-Free Futures,” will implement evidence-based, trauma-informed prevention strategies to reach more than 3,000 youth across Palm Beach and Broward counties over the next five years. The initiative is spearheaded by Maria Carmenza Mejia, M.D., principal investigator and a professor of population health in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with co-investigators Lea Sacca, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Population Health, Schmidt College of Medicine, and Brian Graves, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Phyllis and Harvey Sandler School of Social Work within FAU’s College of Social Work and Criminal Justice. The Rising Strong initiative is not only timely – it is profoundly necessary, as South Florida’s youth navigate the effects of increasing social, economic and mental health stressors, with substance use often emerging as a coping response. This program directly targets youth who are especially at risk, including those transitioning out of foster care, experiencing housing instability, residing in rural communities such as the Glades, and those who are survivors of human trafficking. School-age youth and young adults in need of behavioral health support will also be a central focus. A cornerstone of the initiative is FAU’s partnership with the FLITE Center, a Fort Lauderdale-based nonprofit that currently serves more than 2,000 youth aging out of foster care, chronically homeless youth, and other vulnerable youth. FLITE Center is Broward County’s one-stop resource center offering all supportive services. “We’re in the midst of a growing mental and behavioral health crisis among young people, particularly those navigating trauma, housing instability, or limited access to consistent care and support,” said Mejia. “This award gives us the opportunity to respond with evidence-based strategies, deep empathy, and strong community partnerships. Rising Strong isn’t just a program – it’s a commitment to every young person that their future matters, their voice counts, and that they deserve a life free from substance use and filled with possibilities.” Through Rising Strong, South Florida youth will gain access to a suite of integrated, evidence-based services, including LifeSkills Training to build decision-making and interpersonal abilities, mindfulness and emotional regulation programming to support trauma recovery, peer mentorship opportunities to foster connection and resilience, and SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment), which offers targeted support for those identified as at risk for substance use. These services will be delivered through schools, community centers and existing behavioral health networks, ensuring broad accessibility and minimal barriers to entry. “This grant represents the best of what we strive for at Florida Atlantic University – collaboration, impact and transformation,” said Lewis S. Nelson, M.D., dean and chief of health affairs, Schmidt College of Medicine. “When academic expertise joins forces with community leadership, we can reach young people where they are and give them the tools to rewrite their stories. This initiative is a testament to what’s possible when we invest in prevention, listen to our youth, and build systems of care that reflect their lived realities. For families, schools and communities across South Florida, Rising Strong will be a beacon of hope.” Beyond service delivery, the initiative aims to drive long-term systems change. Within its first six months, the project will conduct a comprehensive regional needs assessment and convene a multi-sector prevention coalition to inform implementation. Each year, at least 30 professionals will be trained in trauma-informed and culturally responsive prevention strategies, building the community’s collective capacity to respond to youth needs. Over five years, the program will train 150 professionals and directly serve 600 youth annually. “Social work brings a systems lens to prevention by connecting people, policies and practices to create lasting change,” said Naelys Luna, Ph.D., dean of the College of Social Work and Criminal Justice. “Rising Strong will not only provide direct services to youth, but also build a stronger, more responsive network of care across South Florida. By training professionals, engaging communities and addressing root causes, this initiative reflects the core values of our field. We are excited to participate in this important endeavor and collaborate with partners dedicated to creating meaningful opportunities for our youth and our communities.” FAU’s leadership in behavioral health and community-based research provides a strong foundation for the initiative. The Schmidt College of Medicine and the College of Social Work and Criminal Justice are nationally recognized for their contributions to trauma-informed care, health equity, and systems-level interventions. The collaboration with FLITE Center exemplifies FAU’s commitment to working hand-in-hand with community partners to address the root causes of public health challenges. The program will continue through Sept. 29, 2030. “As Rising Strong grows, it has the potential to become a national model for youth substance use prevention that centers community voices, respects lived experience and champions the resilience of young people,” said Mejia.

    "headline": "World's First Bench-to-Bedside MRI, Focused Ultrasound System Unveiled",
    "content": "(Photo by Alex Dolce) In a global first, Florida Atlantic University has unveiled an unprecedented research initiative uniting advanced MRI and focused ultrasound technologies into a single, preclinical and clinical research platform that promises to accelerate the pathway from scientific discovery to patient care. This state-of-the-art initiative at the Florida Atlantic NeuroInnovate Center empowers scientists to explore the brain and body with exceptional precision, advancing the understanding of complex neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and more. Integrating a comprehensive “bench-to-bedside” approach, the initiative will significantly accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new treatments, ultimately transforming patient care. “Never before has a single institution integrated preclinical and clinical imaging with focused ultrasound capabilities within one comprehensive, unified research environment,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “This is far more than just a milestone for Florida Atlantic University. This groundbreaking initiative positions our region and state at the forefront of innovation in research, education and health care delivery. We are excited to lead the way in bringing revolutionary research and technologies to the frontlines of medicine.” Researchers will now have access to a fully integrated system that allows them to study disease mechanisms, test treatments in real time, and apply those therapies directly to patients. It begins with the preclinical MRI, designed for research using translational models. Once a treatment shows promise, it can move seamlessly to human trials using the clinical MRI system that guides and monitors therapies in a safe, controlled setting. “These machines are more than just high-tech – they represent some of the most advanced tools available to modern science and medicine,” said Gregg Fields, Ph.D., vice president for research at FAU. “What we’ve built is a truly integrated research platform – one that enables us to examine everything from molecular changes in clinical models to real-time treatment responses in human patients. The impact this will have on fast-tracking discoveries across disciplines is hard to overstate. This is not just the next step in medical innovation – it’s the future, and it’s happening right here at Florida Atlantic University.” Focused ultrasound uses precise acoustic energy, like sunlight through a magnifying glass, to target tissues safely. Multiple beams converge at one point, producing mechanical or thermal effects. This non-invasive, rapidly advancing therapy has growing clinical uses in a wide range of diseases including neurological disorders, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and pain management. Through strategic partnerships with Delray Medical Center, Boca Raton Regional Hospital – part of Baptist Health – and the Thomas H. Corey VA Medical Center, FAU researchers and physicians will leverage the Florida Atlantic NeuroInnovate Center to tackle a range of neurological conditions. This initiative builds on Florida Atlantic’s 2023 collaboration with Insightec and Delray Medical Center, which introduced focused ultrasound into the clinical setting to treat patients with movement and cognitive disorders. “As a neurosurgeon, I’m truly excited about the potential of this integrated system at Florida Atlantic to elevate patient care,” said Lloyd Zucker, M.D., medical director of neurosurgery at Palm Beach Health Network and a clinical research professor at Florida Atlantic. “The precision and noninvasive capabilities of technologies like focused ultrasound are revolutionizing how we approach neurological diseases. We’re not just imagining the future of medicine – we’re making it happen.” “This level of imaging and intervention opens the door to understanding and treating brain disorders in ways that were unimaginable even a decade ago,” said Michael Dobbs, M.D., chair of the Clinical Neurosciences Department and the inaugural FairfaxWood Chair of Clinical Neurosciences in the FAU Schmidt College of Medicine. “We can assess brain structure, monitor real-time blood flow, and track treatment effects – all with extraordinary precision. The implications for disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are profound.” “This pioneering system will also serve as a cornerstone for educating the next generation of physicians, scientists and biomedical engineers,” said Lewis S. Nelson, M.D., dean of the Schmidt College of Medicine. “By offering an immersive, hands-on learning environment, it will empower future health professionals to lead with innovation and shape the future of medicine.” The new platform continues the ongoing expansion of Florida Atlantic University’s academic and research mission. Designed to reshape the way clinicians and researchers treat, understand and study complex brain diseases, this unique system integrates multiple technologies to provide unmatched diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. The Florida Atlantic NeuroInnovate Center includes the SIGNA™ Premier 3.0T MRI from GE Healthcare, the NordicNeuroLab fMRI System for functional neuroimaging, and the BioSpec Maxwell 70/17 and 94/17 preclinical MRI systems. The addition of a low-frequency focused ultrasound unit (Insightec Prime 220 V3) creates a unified environment that supports everything from preclinical investigations to FDA-regulated clinical trials and patient care. The integration of the NordicNeuroLab fMRI system, in-scanner EEG, and Biopac physiological monitoring tools will give students, residents and faculty unmatched exposure to emerging research and clinical tools. Representing the culmination of years of collaboration across disciplines and institutions and marking the beginning of a new era in medical science, Florida Atlantic University is poised to deliver a future in which disease is not only better understood but more effectively treated – from “bench to the bedside.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",

    "headline": "Beyond the Pink Ribbon: Combating Breast Cancer in Younger Women",
    "content": "About 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in the U.S. this year and about 42,170 will die from breast cancer. As National Breast Cancer Awareness Month gets underway, research from Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing is bringing attention to a concerning public health issue – early-onset breast cancer and the rising rates of breast cancer among women diagnosed under age 50. Led by Tarsha Jones, RN, Ph.D., principal investigator and an associate professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, the research focuses on young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) and highlights the critical importance of genetic testing, risk-reduction, and family risk communication. Supported by a multi-year grant from the National Institutes of Health, her study deepens the understanding of how younger women experience breast cancer and the unique challenges faced by this population. Jones’ work is part of a growing call in the medical community to investigate why more women are being diagnosed younger, and how to provide equitable, evidence-based support – particularly as research suggests genetics only explain part of the picture. The research team conducted a cross-sectional study and surveyed 97 YBCS, all diagnosed under age 50, recruited from comprehensive cancer centers in New York and Florida. Additional women were also recruited through community-based organizations. Key participant characteristics include: These insights underscore the need for greater awareness of early warning signs and proactive risk management. While mammograms remain a crucial screening tool, self-awareness and timely action can be lifesaving. “Our data shows that genetics – such as pathogenic mutations or variants – is only part of the big picture. We found that while most women, 93%, completed genetic testing, the majority, 76.1%, had negative test results,” said Jones. “We recognize that there are multiple determinants of health at play, and more research is needed to investigate the complex interaction between biological, behavioral, psychological, social and environmental exposures in order to reduce cancer health disparities and improve health outcomes for all women.” Four women who were diagnosed at a young age and participated in the study courageously share their stories, as a reminder that breast cancer doesn’t come with an age limit. They are participating in a digital storytelling project, which highlights the human side of cancer and offers the unique perspectives of YBCS to educate, inspire and bring hope to other women. With support from an NIH Mentored Research Scientist Award, interprofessional collaborations and a mentoring team, Jones is refining and evaluating a multi-component digital storytelling intervention tailored to the educational, clinical and psychosocial needs of YBCS. Breast Cancer Awareness: What Can You Do? “At FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, a caring science approach grounds everything we do – including breast cancer research. This philosophy transforms data into dignity, recognizing that behind every statistic is a whole person whose well-being is nurtured through presence, compassion and meaningful connection,” said Cameron Duncan, Ph.D., DNP, the Holli Rockwell Trubinsky Eminent Dean of Nursing in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “This research is a vital step forward in understanding and addressing the unique challenges young women with breast cancer face. By shedding light on these early diagnoses, we strive to inspire hope, drive prevention and ultimately save lives.” About 316,950 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in the United States this year and about 42,170 will die from breast cancer. “Women under 50, represent 16% of the total invasive breast cancer cases, according to the American Cancer Society,” said Jones. “Younger women with breast cancer have profoundly different experiences, complex challenges and are more likely to die of the disease compared to older women with the disease, emphasizing the critical importance of ongoing support for women’s health research.” The individual stories were shared with permission from the survivors.

    "headline": "Study: 'Man's Best Friend' Slows Cellular Aging in Female Veterans",
    "content": "The study focused on U.S. female veterans and is among the first to examine the impact of working with service dogs in this population. (Photo by Alex Dolce) New research finds that “man’s best friend” may help slow biological aging in women. This groundbreaking study, focused on female veterans in the United States, is among the first to examine the impact of working with service dogs on this often-overlooked population. By measuring biological indicators of stress, the researchers have uncovered a key insight: the way stress is felt emotionally doesn’t always reflect how it affects the body at a cellular level. While women have served in the U.S. military for generations, their roles have expanded dramatically since 1948. Yet despite their growing presence and unique experiences, most military studies still center on men – even as women report higher rates of PTSD. Building on the need for focused research, Florida Atlantic University researchers, in collaboration with the University of Maryland School of Nursing, the Medical College of Georgia, and Warrior Canine Connection, Inc., conducted the study involving female veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. But instead of receiving service dogs, these women volunteered to train them for fellow veterans in need – offering support not just to others, but potentially to themselves. The study, supported by the National Institutes of Health’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development, examined whether this purposeful, mission-driven activity could reduce both biological and psychological stress, and whether previous combat exposure influenced those effects. Until now, the emotional and therapeutic benefits of such unique relationships have been largely unexamined in female veterans. To measure biological stress, researchers looked at telomere length (a marker of cellular aging) using saliva samples, and heart rate variability (HRV), a sign of nervous system balance, using wearable monitors in participants in the service dog training program group or a comparison group that watched dog training videos. Psychological stress was assessed using validated questionnaires measuring PTSD symptoms, perceived stress, and anxiety at multiple points during the study. Results, published in the journal Behavioral Sciences, revealed promising biological benefits associated with service dog training – particularly for veterans with combat experience – while improvements in psychological symptoms were seen across all participants, regardless of the intervention. One of the most striking findings involved telomere length. Veterans who participated in the dog-training program showed an increase in telomere length, suggesting a slowing of cellular aging. In contrast, those in the control group exhibited a decrease in telomere length, indicating accelerated aging. Combat experience significantly influenced these results: veterans with combat exposure who trained service dogs experienced the greatest gains in telomere length, whereas those with combat exposure in the control group saw the most pronounced declines. On the psychological front, both groups – those who trained dogs and those in the control group – reported significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, anxiety and perceived stress over the eight-week period. However, these mental health improvements were similar across groups, suggesting that simply participating in the study and receiving structured attention may have offered therapeutic value. Unlike the biological findings, psychological outcomes did not appear to be affected by combat exposure. “Female veterans face unique reintegration challenges that are often overlooked, and traditional PTSD treatments don’t always meet their needs,” said Cheryl Krause-Parello, Ph.D., first author, associate vice president for FAU research, associate executive director, FAU I-Health, and director of C-PAWW™. “Nontraditional approaches like connecting with animals can offer meaningful support. These relationships provide emotional safety and stability, which can be especially powerful for women. But not all veterans can care for a service animal, so animal-related volunteerism may offer similar healing benefits without the burden of ownership.” The study also suggests that the skills learned during service dog training – such as positive reinforcement and reading animal behavior – may have strengthened participants’ bonds with their own pets at home, offering additional emotional support. Unlike general volunteering, service dog training uniquely blends emotional healing with building a close relationship between veterans and their animals, providing therapeutic benefits that go beyond typical community engagement. “This research underscores the power of service dog training as a meaningful, non-pharmacological intervention to support the health and healing of female veterans with PTSD,” said Krause-Parello. “It opens the door to more personalized approaches that nurture both the mind and body.” Female veterans aged 32 to 72 were randomly assigned to either the service dog training program group or a comparison group that watched dog training videos. Both groups took part in one-hour sessions each week for eight weeks. Researchers measured outcomes before, during and after the program. These findings provide early evidence that non-pharmacological interventions – such as service dog training – may help reduce the physical toll of stress and slow cellular aging in female veterans.

    "headline": "Chatbots the New 'Doc?' Exploring AI in Health Behavior Coaching",
    "content": "Advances in artificial intelligence are opening new possibilities to bring motivational interviewing to more people through digital tools. Changing health habits – like quitting smoking, exercising more, or sticking to prescribed treatments – is difficult but crucial for preventing and managing chronic diseases. Motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered counseling method that helps people find their own motivation to change, has proven effective across many health care settings. Yet despite strong evidence, MI is not widely used in clinical practice due to challenges like limited time, training demands and payment barriers. Advances in artificial intelligence, however, are opening new possibilities to bring MI to more people through digital tools. AI-powered chatbots, apps and virtual agents can simulate the supportive, empathetic conversations at the heart of MI. Using approaches ranging from scripted dialogues to advanced large language models like GPT-4 (commonly known as ChatGPT), these tools provide around-the-clock, judgment-free support. They may be especially helpful for people who do not seek traditional behavioral health care. Early studies suggest these AI tools are feasible and acceptable, but it remains unclear how closely they follow core MI principles such as empathy and promoting autonomy, and whether they effectively change behaviors. Evaluating this “MI fidelity” is challenging, as traditional methods need detailed human review and don’t scale well. To fill these important knowledge gaps, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine conducted the first scoping review of studies on AI-driven systems designed to deliver motivational interviewing. They focused on exploring how AI tools such as chatbots and large language models are being used to deliver MI, what is known about their usability and acceptability, the extent to which these systems adhere to core MI principles, and the behavioral or psychological outcomes reported so far. Results, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, reveal that the most used AI tools were chatbots, with some virtual agents and mobile apps, using technologies ranging from rule-based systems to advanced models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. While all aimed to simulate motivational interviewing, the quality and rigor of their evaluations varied. Only a few studies addressed safety concerns around AI-generated content, with most not detailing safeguards against misinformation or inappropriate responses. While only a few studies reported actual behavioral changes, most focused on important psychological factors like readiness to change and feeling understood. Importantly, no studies looked at long-term behavioral outcomes, and follow-up periods were often short or missing entirely. So, while AI tools can effectively deliver motivational content and influence early signs of change, their ability to create lasting behavior shifts remains unclear. “Many digital interventions included motivational ‘elements’ but didn’t clearly show if or how they follow formal MI practices,” said Maria Carmenza Mejia, M.D., senior author and a professor of population health, Schimdt College of Medicine. “We carefully mapped the specific techniques used – like open-ended questions, affirmations, and reflective listening – and looked at how fidelity was assessed, whether through expert review or study design. This level of detail is essential to understand what these AI tools are actually doing and how well they mirror true motivational interviewing.” Findings show that despite their strengths, limitations around emotional nuance and conversational depth were commonly noted. “Users appreciated the convenience and structure of AI systems but often missed the ‘human touch’ and complex relational dynamics of face-to-face counseling,” said Mejia. Participants in the studies varied widely from general adults to college students and patients with specific health conditions. Smoking cessation was the most common focus, followed by substance use reduction, stress management, and other health behaviors. “AI-driven systems show exciting potential to deliver motivational interviewing and support meaningful health behavior change,” said Mejia. “These tools are feasible and well-accepted across various health issues, demonstrating key principles like empathy and collaboration. However, few studies have rigorously evaluated their impact on behavior or fidelity. As AI health interventions evolve, future research must focus on robust evaluation, transparency and ethical responsibility. By blending scalable AI technology with proven behavioral frameworks, we can expand access and better support patients facing behavior change challenges.” Study co-authors are FAU medical students Zev Karve, Jacob Caley, Christopher Machado and Michelle K.

    "headline": "FAU Joins Neuroarts Academic Network to Bridge Art, Brain and Healing",
    "content": "As a member of the Neuroarts Academic Network, FAU will amplify its ongoing efforts at the intersection of neuroscience, healing and the arts. Florida Atlantic University has joined the newly launched Neuroarts Academic Network (NAN), recently announced by the NeuroArts Blueprint Initiative. NAN is a global initiative aimed at expanding the transformative power of the arts – such as music, dance, painting and storytelling – by building the emerging interdisciplinary field of neuroarts and training the next generation of leaders. Building on research that demonstrates how art positively affects the brain and body, NAN will explore how creative expression can be embedded in mainstream medicine, public health and across society to improve health and well-being for all. FAU will help lead this groundbreaking global movement to harness the power of aesthetic experiences to enhance brain health and transform care across disciplines. FAU is one of only two universities in Florida – and one of more than 35 institutions worldwide – selected to join the network’s initial working group. “This is a significant step for Florida Atlantic University and for the emerging field of neuroarts,” said Randy Blakely, Ph.D., FAU designated official for NAN, executive director of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, the David J.S. Nicholson Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience, and a professor of biomedical science in the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine. “Building on the momentum of the NeuroArts Blueprint, joining NAN recognizes FAU for its commitment to programs to unite the arts with brain science and medicine. This commitment not only recognizes a growing movement but also opens a door to transformative research opportunities – particularly in understanding how aesthetic experience can impact brain health. We are proud to help shape a future where creativity and science work hand in hand to improve lives.” Blakely will lead the initiative in close collaboration with Nicole Baganz, Ph.D., director of community engagement and programming, FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, and academic collaborators across FAU and the broader community through the Program in Artistic Resilience, a key component of the soon to be launched FAU Center for the Resilient Mind. “The arts are not merely expressions of human experience – they are powerful tools for healing and neurobiological integration,” said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, who will partner with Blakely to develop the Program in Artistic Resilience. “Decades of research demonstrate that engaging with the arts stimulates complex brain networks involved in emotion, memory and cognition. By joining this interdisciplinary network, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing scientific inquiry into how the arts promote both individual healing and the well-being of communities.” The partnership with NAN is designed to amplify FAU’s ongoing efforts at the intersection of neuroscience, healing and the arts. One signature event in this activity will be the Insights VIII Exhibition, opening Feb. 20, 2026, at the FAU Ritter Art Gallery – a partnership with Horswell and Veronique Côté, Ph.D., director of FAU Galleries. The exhibit, part of the Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute’s annual Brainy Days celebration, features work generated by artists living with bipolar disorder, illuminating the role of creative expression in developing resilience, heightening public understanding, and combatting stigma. As part of the NAN effort, the institute is also set to launch a pilot grant program to support innovative research at the crossroads of neuroscience and the arts – jump-starting collaborative projects that explore how creative disciplines such as music, dance, theater and the visual arts can influence brain function and health and support emotional well-being. “At this formative stage, the generous seed funding from the Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute is critical to launching collaborative research in neuroarts,” said Michael R. Dobbs, M.D., the first endowed FairfaxWood Chair of Clinical Neurosciences, chair and professor of the Clinical Neurosciences Department and associate dean of clinical affairs in the Schmidt College of Medicine. “This support may prove truly transformative – advancing our understanding of how artistic expression can be harnessed to improve brain health, enhance therapeutic outcomes and open new frontiers in treatment.” The NeuroArts Blueprint Initiative, which launched the NAN, is co-led by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s International Arts + Mind Lab Center for Applied Neuroaesthetics and the Aspen Institute’s Health, Medicine & Society Program, with support from The Music Man Foundation. The initiative is co-directed by Susan Magsamen, executive director of the International Arts + Mind Lab at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Ruth J. Katz, executive director of the Health, Medicine & Society Program at the Aspen Institute. “Neuroarts is a vibrant, interdisciplinary field grounded in evidence-based knowledge and united by shared research principles, practices and values. To fully realize its potential, we must learn from one another, develop a common language, and build a collaborative framework that enables our disciplines to flourish individually while also working together to build the field,” said Magsamen. The network’s goal is to establish neuroarts as a rigorous academic and professional field that bridges arts, health, basic sciences, public policy and community engagement. “In these challenging times of rapid change, the Neuroarts Academic Network offers a bold, collaborative model to strengthen neuroarts education, workforce development and interdisciplinary impact,” said Katz. “It is essential to advancing this important and game-changing work.” The Insights VIII exhibit, presented in partnership with the Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation, will run from Feb. 20 to March 6, 2026, and will feature more than 40 works selected from more than 200 national submissions. According to Blakely, several artists whose work will be displayed in the exhibit will be in attendance across the span of the exhibit with hopes of sharing insights into their process and goals for artistic expression. “Our inclusion in the Neuroarts Academic Network reinforces our commitment to interdisciplinary innovation, public health impact, and the belief that science and the arts have much to inform the other along the road to human vitality,” said Blakely.

    "headline": "Study First to Show if Nesting Heat Affects Sea Turtle Hatchling 'IQ'",
    "content": "A loggerhead hatchling goes through the Y-maze to test its learning abilities. (Photo credit: Sarah Milton, Florida Atlantic University) As sand temperatures continue to rise, concerns about the future of sea turtles are growing. Hotter nests not only skew sex ratios – producing more females – but also reduce hatchling survival, slow growth, and increase the likelihood of physical deformities. Yet one important and often overlooked question remains: does this heat also affect cognitive ability – how well hatchlings can learn, adapt and respond to the rapidly changing world they face from the moment they emerge? A new study by researchers at Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science offers a surprising glimmer of hope. They are the first to test whether incubation temperature affects cognitive ability in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) hatchlings – how well they can learn, adapt and problem-solve. While animal cognition has been widely studied in birds and mammals, much is yet to be discovered in reptiles. Using a Y-maze and a visual discrimination task, the researchers trained hatchlings incubated at two female-producing temperatures (88 F and a hotter 91 F) and then tested their ability to “reverse train” when the task rules changed. Eggs were collected during the summers of 2019 and 2020 from nesting beaches in Palm Beach County. In the initial acquisition phase of training, approximately four weeks after the turtles hatched, they were trained to associate a food reward with a specific monochromatic pattern such as stripes or a bullseye, which were positioned at the ends of the maze. In the reversal phase, the reward pattern was switched, requiring the turtles to abandon the original association and learn that they would need to go to a different target for the reward. This reversal task measured behavioral flexibility – the ability to adapt to new information, which may be essential for survival in dynamic environments like the ocean. Unexpectedly, the study results published in the journal Endangered Species Research found no significant differences in learning ability between the temperature groups. In both years, hatchlings from both temperature treatments were able to successfully complete the acquisition and reversal tasks. In 2020, they even performed significantly better during the reversal phase, learning faster than they had during initial training. “Not only were the post-hatchlings capable of suppressing previously learned behaviors to form new, more advantageous associations, they were able to do so with remarkable speed – often requiring fewer trials than the initial learning phase,” said Sarah L. Milton, Ph.D., senior author and chair and professor in the FAU Department of Biological Sciences. “This surprising level of behavioral flexibility suggests that these young turtles may be better equipped to navigate and adapt to rapidly changing environmental challenges than we previously understood. Such adaptability could prove crucial for their survival in an increasingly unpredictable world.” However, findings also revealed that higher incubation temperatures negatively affected several key physical traits. Hatchlings from the 91 F nests had shorter incubation durations, lower hatching success, slower post-hatch growth, and more frequent scute anomalies – defects in the scales of their shell. They were also smaller – an outcome that could compromise swimming performance and predator evasion. “The concern remains very real,” said Ivana J. Lezcano, corresponding author and a doctoral candidate in FAU’s Department of Biological Sciences. “Elevated incubation temperatures are known to produce smaller, less physically resilient hatchlings and cause a significant decline in overall hatching success. Together, this can pose serious risks to population survival. However, our finding that cognitive ability and learning may remain largely unaffected, at least in the short-term, by these higher temperatures offers a hopeful perspective. It suggests that, despite other developmental and physical challenges, these turtles may retain the mental flexibility needed to adapt to their changing environments. This resilience gives us one of the first glimpses of how incubation temperature may affect behavioral traits, though ongoing research is essential to fully understand the long-term implications.” The researchers stress that while these results are encouraging, they come with caveats. The study only examined temperatures up to 91 F, and nesting beaches in South Florida have already recorded sand temperatures exceeding 93 F to almost 96 F – levels known to severely affect hatching success and hatchling performance. More extreme temperatures could still pose risks to brain development and cognition that weren’t evident at the sublethal range tested here. Furthermore, while a nest in the field is typically considered “successful” if the majority of the hatchlings emerge from it, the study suggests that survival models may need to go beyond emergence rates and factor in hatchling quality – physical and behavioral alike. “The hatchlings in our study were able to swiftly adjust to new information despite developmental stressors,” said Milton. “This behavioral adaptability is not just a survival mechanism – it’s a critical evolutionary advantage that may enable them to cope with the complex challenges posed by their shifting habitats. Conservation efforts must prioritize not only the preservation of hatchling populations but also the environmental conditions that support their ongoing cognitive development and resilience.” As sea turtle embryos are so strongly influenced by the thermal conditions of their nest, understanding how temperature affects not just who survives but how well they are equipped for survival is critical. This research was supported by the FAU School of Environmental, Coastal, and Ocean Sustainability within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. Hatchlings were trained to associate a food reward with a specific pattern such as a bullseye at the end of a Y-maze. In the reversal phase, the reward was switched to a different pattern, requiring them to relearn the association.

    "headline": "FAU Lands EPA Grant to Use Genetics in Florida Bay Sponge Restoration",
    "content": "Andia Chaves-Fonnegra, Ph.D., principal investigator, conducting research in the field. Andia Chaves-Fonnegra, Ph.D., an associate professor of biology at Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, has been awarded a five-year, $720,446 grant from the United States EPA to support a pioneering project aimed at restoring sponge populations in Florida Bay through a genetics-based approach. Florida Bay is a shallow body of water between the southern tip of mainland Florida and the Florida Keys. It is part of Everglades National Park, which supports important marine life like sponges, fish and spiny lobster. The project marks the first genetic assessment of sponge restoration efforts in the region and seeks to build long-term ecological resilience in one of the nation’s most vulnerable marine environments. Sponges are a vital component of benthic, hard-bottom communities throughout Florida Bay and the Florida reef tract. These organisms perform essential ecological functions – filtering vast volumes of water, cycling nutrients such as nitrogen, stabilizing seafloor sediments, and providing habitat for a variety of marine species. Among the most economically important is the spiny lobster, which depends on sponge-rich environments as nursery grounds. Although we may not think of sponges as important or charismatic animals, they support a multi-million-dollar lobster fishery in South Florida. In addition, two of the sponge species in the study are commercial bath sponges, which, on their own, also supported the highly successful sponge fishery industry before the introduction of plastic sponges and the collapse of their populations. The degradation of sponge communities has had cascading impacts on both the sponge and lobster fisheries, as well as on the broader ecosystem services that sponges provide. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in restoring sponge populations through transplantation programs that use asexual cuttings. These efforts, spearheaded by a coalition of scientists, state agencies, and community partners, have helped to reestablish sponge cover in areas heavily impacted by disease, phytoplankton blooms, and cold-water events. However, because these transplants are clonal, they lack genetic diversity, limiting the resilience of restored populations to environmental stressors and reducing their capacity to adapt to shifts in weather patterns. Chaves-Fonnegra’s research will address this critical limitation by integrating population genetics into restoration strategies. Her team will analyze the genetic structure and diversity of four key sponge species currently used in Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) restoration programs: Spongia Barbara – a type of bath sponge known for its soft textures, Spongia graminea – referred to as the grass sponge, Ircinia campana – known as the vase sponge because of its shape, and Spheciospongia vesparium – commonly called the loggerhead sponge. Using advanced tools such as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms, the researchers will evaluate genetic diversity, inbreeding levels, clonality, and reproductive success in both nursery and outplant sites. This innovative project will also examine the degree to which restored sponges are reproducing sexually with wild populations and whether their offspring are genetically diverse enough to withstand the pressures of a warming ocean. “Receiving this EPA grant is incredibly significant because it means that we can move from simply rebuilding sponge numbers to restoring sponge populations with the genetic strength to withstand a shifting climate, disease, and other growing threats,” said Chaves-Fonnegra, principal investigator. “For the region, that means more stable fisheries, healthier reef ecosystems, clearer waters, and a safeguard for communities and businesses that depend on a thriving Florida Bay. It’s not just science – it’s an investment in resilience, for our ecosystems and for our people.” Florida’s coral reef ecosystems, which include reefs, hard-bottom habitats, and sponge communities, support more than $1 billion annually in tourism and recreational activities. Reef-related fishing generates more than $150 million in sales each year, and tens of thousands of jobs across the state depend on the health of these marine systems. As Florida’s coastal ecosystems face increasing threats, restoration efforts must evolve to ensure they are both effective and adaptive. Through this work, FAU is helping to shape the future of marine conservation in Florida, integrating science, policy, and innovation to protect one of the state’s most ecologically and economically valuable natural resources.

    "headline": "Single Drug Shows Promise to Treat PTSD, Pain, and Alcohol Misuse",
    "content": "PTSD affects about 12 million U.S. adults, with veterans hit especially hard – and many also grappling with alcohol use disorder and chronic pain. These conditions often overlap and fuel each other, making treatment complex and largely ineffective. (Photo by Alex Dolce) About 12 million adults in the United States are affected by PTSD, impacting between 4% and 8% of the adult population – and up to 30% of military personnel and veterans. Strikingly, 63% of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and/or chronic pain. These conditions frequently overlap, with individuals who have AUD or chronic pain often also experiencing PTSD. When these disorders co-occur, they tend to worsen one another, making effective treatment significantly more challenging. Currently, no approved medications effectively treat PTSD and AUD together, and many available drugs come with serious side effects or limited results. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, conducted two complementary studies in rats to explore how a new drug, PPL-138, might help treat PTSD and its common companions – anxiety, chronic pain, and AUD. A type of opioid partial agonist, PPL-138 works by targeting specific opioid receptors in the brain. Intellectual property related to PPL-138 is owned by Phoenix PharmaLabs, Inc. The company is in the process of advancing PPL-138 through clinical trials. The first study, carried out at the University of Oklahoma, looked at whether long-term treatment with PPL-138 could reduce PTSD-related symptoms in chronic traumatic stress. The second study, conducted at FAU, focused on the relationship between trauma, anxiety and alcohol use, and researchers divided rats into different groups. Results, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, provide promising evidence that PPL-138 could become a valuable treatment for PTSD and alcohol misuse – particularly when symptoms are rooted in anxiety. By targeting a brain system involved in both stress and addiction, researchers believe PPL-138 may one day offer a much-needed breakthrough for those struggling with these life-altering conditions. Findings show that PPL-138 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior, pain responses, and alcohol consumption – but only in rats that developed PTSD-like symptoms. In both male and female rats, the drug selectively reduced alcohol use in those that also showed signs of trauma-related anxiety, without affecting those that were resilient or not stressed. “Our results show that PPL-138 not only reduces trauma-related anxiety and pain, but also selectively curbs alcohol use in rats most vulnerable to stress-induced drinking,” said Andrea Cippitelli, Ph.D., lead author and an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Science within the Schmidt College of Medicine and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute. “This kind of targeted treatment could transform how we manage PTSD and its comorbidities – especially for the large number of patients who currently fall through the cracks of existing therapies.” The study findings also emphasize the need to consider sex differences in both the causes and treatment of these overlapping conditions. Among female rats, PPL-138 reduced alcohol intake in those exhibiting anxiety, even if their drinking had not escalated. This indicates that anxiety alone may be a primary factor driving alcohol use in females. “Anxious male rats were twice as likely as females to increase their alcohol intake following trauma, while nearly all female rats with more alcohol intake also displayed clear signs of anxiety,” said Cippitelli. “This mirrors well-documented patterns in humans, where women are more prone to anxiety-related disorders like PTSD and often use alcohol to cope with emotional distress, whereas men typically engage in heavier, more generalized drinking.” Importantly, the effects of PPL-138 were not due to sedation or reduced activity. The compound did not alter movement or alcohol consumption in rats with anxiety-related behaviors or traumatic stress. In fact, movement levels remained unchanged in male rats and slightly increased in females – supporting the idea that the drug acts specifically on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, rather than causing general suppression or sedation. “This research represents a much-needed step toward helping both civilians and veterans living with the invisible wounds of trauma,” said Cippitelli. “In our preclinical studies, PPL-138 shows strong potential as a single therapy for the overlapping symptoms of PTSD, chronic pain, and alcohol misuse – offering a potentially safer and more effective alternative to current multi-drug approaches.” Study co-authors are Yong Zhang, Ph.D., University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy; Kyle Kealoha, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Ali Idriss, former research lab technician, FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Panini S.
