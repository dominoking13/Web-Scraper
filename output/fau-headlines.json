    "headline": "Single Drug Shows Promise to Treat PTSD, Pain, and Alcohol Misuse",
    "content": "PTSD affects about 12 million U.S. adults, with veterans hit especially hard – and many also grappling with alcohol use disorder and chronic pain. These conditions often overlap and fuel each other, making treatment complex and largely ineffective. (Photo by Alex Dolce) About 12 million adults in the United States are affected by PTSD, impacting between 4% and 8% of the adult population – and up to 30% of military personnel and veterans. Strikingly, 63% of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and/or chronic pain. These conditions frequently overlap, with individuals who have AUD or chronic pain often also experiencing PTSD. When these disorders co-occur, they tend to worsen one another, making effective treatment significantly more challenging. Currently, no approved medications effectively treat PTSD and AUD together, and many available drugs come with serious side effects or limited results. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, conducted two complementary studies in rats to explore how a new drug, PPL-138, might help treat PTSD and its common companions – anxiety, chronic pain, and AUD. A type of opioid partial agonist, PPL-138 works by targeting specific opioid receptors in the brain. Intellectual property related to PPL-138 is owned by Phoenix PharmaLabs, Inc. The company is in the process of advancing PPL-138 through clinical trials. The first study, carried out at the University of Oklahoma, looked at whether long-term treatment with PPL-138 could reduce PTSD-related symptoms in chronic traumatic stress. The second study, conducted at FAU, focused on the relationship between trauma, anxiety and alcohol use, and researchers divided rats into different groups. Results, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, provide promising evidence that PPL-138 could become a valuable treatment for PTSD and alcohol misuse – particularly when symptoms are rooted in anxiety. By targeting a brain system involved in both stress and addiction, researchers believe PPL-138 may one day offer a much-needed breakthrough for those struggling with these life-altering conditions. Findings show that PPL-138 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior, pain responses, and alcohol consumption – but only in rats that developed PTSD-like symptoms. In both male and female rats, the drug selectively reduced alcohol use in those that also showed signs of trauma-related anxiety, without affecting those that were resilient or not stressed. “Our results show that PPL-138 not only reduces trauma-related anxiety and pain, but also selectively curbs alcohol use in rats most vulnerable to stress-induced drinking,” said Andrea Cippitelli, Ph.D., lead author and an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Science within the Schmidt College of Medicine and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute. “This kind of targeted treatment could transform how we manage PTSD and its comorbidities – especially for the large number of patients who currently fall through the cracks of existing therapies.” The study findings also emphasize the need to consider sex differences in both the causes and treatment of these overlapping conditions. Among female rats, PPL-138 reduced alcohol intake in those exhibiting anxiety, even if their drinking had not escalated. This indicates that anxiety alone may be a primary factor driving alcohol use in females. “Anxious male rats were twice as likely as females to increase their alcohol intake following trauma, while nearly all female rats with more alcohol intake also displayed clear signs of anxiety,” said Cippitelli. “This mirrors well-documented patterns in humans, where women are more prone to anxiety-related disorders like PTSD and often use alcohol to cope with emotional distress, whereas men typically engage in heavier, more generalized drinking.” Importantly, the effects of PPL-138 were not due to sedation or reduced activity. The compound did not alter movement or alcohol consumption in rats with anxiety-related behaviors or traumatic stress. In fact, movement levels remained unchanged in male rats and slightly increased in females – supporting the idea that the drug acts specifically on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, rather than causing general suppression or sedation. “This research represents a much-needed step toward helping both civilians and veterans living with the invisible wounds of trauma,” said Cippitelli. “In our preclinical studies, PPL-138 shows strong potential as a single therapy for the overlapping symptoms of PTSD, chronic pain, and alcohol misuse – offering a potentially safer and more effective alternative to current multi-drug approaches.” Study co-authors are Yong Zhang, Ph.D., University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy; Kyle Kealoha, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Ali Idriss, former research lab technician, FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Panini S.

    "headline": "Logistics Industry Mixed as Smaller Firms Face Rising Costs",
    "content": "The logistics industry demonstrated mixed signals across its key indicators, as smaller firms try to hedge increasing costs, according to researchers from Florida Atlantic University and four other schools. The logistics industry demonstrated mixed signals across its key indicators, as smaller firms try to hedge increasing costs, according to researchers from Florida Atlantic University and four other schools. August’s reading came in at 59.3, a slight uptick from July’s 59.2, but far below the historical average of 61.5, according to the Logistics Managers Index. Any score above 50 indicates the industry is expanding; a score below 50 suggests contraction. Inventory levels (58.2) and Inventory costs (79.2) rose 2.7 and 7.3 points, respectively, as companies started stocking more goods and inventory became more expensive to hold, contributing to August’s slight increase. Drops in transportation levels and transportation prices contributed downward pressure to this month’s reading. “Given the fluctuating regulatory environment associated with tariff rates and import duties, it appears that firms are consuming more warehouse capacity, as this metric is approaching contraction, and the prices associated with warehousing are up,” said Steven Carnovale, Ph.D., associate professor of supply chain management in FAU’s College of Business. The LMI, a survey of director-level and above supply chain executives, measures the expansion or contraction of the logistics industry using eight unique components: inventory levels, inventory costs, warehousing capacity, warehousing utilization, warehousing prices, transportation capacity, transportation utilization and transportation prices. Along with FAU, researchers at Arizona State University, Colorado State University, Rutgers University, and the University of Nevada at Reno calculated the LMI using a diffusion index. Continuing the trend observed over the last four months, logistics expansion was being disproportionately driven by smaller firms (firms with less than 1,000 employees). Small firms reported an overall index of 62.7, higher than the 58.2 reading reported by larger firms (firms with more than 1,000 employees). “Typically, larger firms have higher buying power and can act more quickly and in larger volumes, such as bulk importing of goods ahead of any published tariff rate increases. We saw this activity in previous reports,” Carnovale said. “This month’s data show that smaller firms are responding to try to hedge cost increases, and this is reflected in their higher overall logistics activity.” The previous gap between upstream firms, or manufacturers and suppliers, and downstream firms, or retailers, disappeared in August, a trend researchers believe indicates better flow through the supply chain. Higher upstream activity with manufacturers and suppliers suggests that the rest of the supply chain will have more logistics activity as products are pushed downstream to retailers. “The shift to higher activity in the downstream suggests that supply chains might be showing stability, but the higher price indexes may result in increased prices to consumers in the coming months,” Carnovale said. “This, coupled with reports of decreased consumer sentiment and spending, needs to be monitored as we enter the forthcoming holiday season.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",

    "headline": "FAU Engineers Create Smarter AI to Redefine Control in Complex Systems",
    "content": "A new AI framework improves management of complex systems with unequal decision-makers, like smart grids, traffic networks, and autonomous vehicles. A new artificial intelligence breakthrough developed by researchers in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University offers a smarter, more efficient way to manage complex systems that rely on multiple decision-makers operating at different levels of authority. This novel framework, recently published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems, could significantly impact the future of smart energy grids, traffic networks and autonomous vehicle systems – technologies that are becoming increasingly central to daily life. In many real-world systems, decisions don’t happen simultaneously or equally. A utility company might decide when to cut power during peak hours, and households must adjust their energy use in response. In traffic systems, central controllers dictate signals while vehicles adapt accordingly. “These types of systems operate under a power hierarchy, where one player makes the first move and others must follow, and they’re more complicated than typical AI models assume,” said Zhen Ni, Ph.D., senior author, IEEE senior member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Traditional AI methods often treat every decision-maker as equal, operating at the same time with the same level of influence. While this makes for clean simulations, it doesn’t reflect how decisions are actually made in real-world scenarios – especially in environments full of uncertainty, limited bandwidth and uneven access to information.” To address this, Ni and Xiangnan Zhong, Ph.D., first author, IEEE member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, designed a new AI framework based on reinforcement learning, a technique that allows intelligent agents to learn from interacting with their environment over time. Their approach adds two key innovations. First, it structures the decision-making process using a game theory model called the Stackelberg-Nash game, where a “leader” agent acts first and “follower” agents respond in an optimal way. This hierarchy better mirrors systems like energy management, connected transportation and autonomous driving. Second, the researchers introduced an event-triggered mechanism that reduces the computational burden. “Instead of constantly updating decisions at every time step, which is typical of many AI systems, our method updates decisions only when necessary, saving energy and processing power while maintaining performance and stability,” said Zhong. The result is a system that not only handles the power asymmetry between decision-makers but also deals with mismatched uncertainties – cases where different players operate with varying levels of information and predictability. This is especially critical in environments like smart grids or traffic control systems, where conditions change rapidly and resources are often limited. The framework allows for a more robust, adaptive and scalable form of AI control that can make better use of limited bandwidth and computing resources. “This work fills a crucial gap in the current AI landscape. By developing a method that reflects real-world decision hierarchies and adapts to imperfect information, Professors Zhong and Ni are helping us move closer to practical, intelligent systems that can handle the complexity of our modern infrastructure,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “The implications of this research are far-reaching. Whether it’s optimizing power consumption across cities or making autonomous systems more reliable, this kind of innovation is foundational to the future of intelligent technology. It represents a step forward not just for AI research, but for the everyday systems we depend on.” Backed by rigorous theoretical analysis and validated through simulation studies, Zhong and Ni demonstrated that their event-triggered reinforcement learning method maintains system stability, ensures optimal strategy outcomes and effectively reduces unnecessary computation. The approach combines deep control theory with practical machine learning, offering a compelling path forward for intelligent control in asymmetric, uncertain environments. Two related journal articles have recently been published on IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence as well. The research work is mainly supported by the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Transportation. The research team is now working on expanding their model for larger-scale testing in real-world scenarios. Their long-term vision is to integrate this AI framework into operational systems that power cities, manage traffic and coordinate fleets of autonomous machines – bringing the promise of smarter infrastructure one step closer to reality.

Malone International Leadership Award, given annually by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. This national honor recognizes the lifetime achievement and outstanding contributions of individuals who advance international education at public universities. “It is an honor to be recognized by the APLU for something that is a great passion of mine,” said Ivy. “I value the international connections I made as a student, and I am happy to have had the opportunity to be part of bringing that experience to the FAU community.” Ivy also currently oversees the Center for Global Engagement, which he was instrumental in establishing nearly a decade ago. This centralized hub has brought together international student services, study abroad, intensive English programs and employment-based immigration services, supporting the “Global Perspectives and Participation” platform of the university’s 2015-25 strategic plan. Ivy’s dedication, mentorship and strategic vision has further strengthened FAU’s global footprint. “Success is a standard outcome for international students at Florida Atlantic, and it is propelled by the strategies and support systems that Dr. Ivy initiated,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “We are incredibly proud of all that he has done to further international education and global engagement at Florida Atlantic, which have benefitted both our university and local community.” The Center for Global Engagement provides programs to help international students at FAU achieve academic and career goals. International enrollment has grown to more than 2,000 students from more than 100 countries, who contribute to the university’s vibrant community, giving all students exposure to a wide variety of perspectives, ideas and traditions. “Congratulations to Russell Ivy on winning the 2025 Michael P. Malone International Leadership Award,” said Mark Becker, president of APLU. “As a champion of international engagement for more than 30 years, his work to advance global impact and international collaboration has enhanced FAU’s education, research and community engagement mission and helped bolster critical international engagement in the higher education sector.” APLU’s Office of International, Community, & Economic Engagement leads the association’s wide array of international initiatives. These initiatives help support campus internationalization, enhance and expand study abroad opportunities, strengthen engagement with the developing world, and support members’ efforts to engage with partners worldwide to address global challenges.
