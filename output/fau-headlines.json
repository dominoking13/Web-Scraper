    "content": "The study focused on U.S. female veterans and is among the first to examine the impact of working with service dogs in this population. (Photo by Alex Dolce) New research finds that “man’s best friend” may help slow biological aging in women. This groundbreaking study, focused on female veterans in the United States, is among the first to examine the impact of working with service dogs on this often-overlooked population. By measuring biological indicators of stress, the researchers have uncovered a key insight: the way stress is felt emotionally doesn’t always reflect how it affects the body at a cellular level. While women have served in the U.S. military for generations, their roles have expanded dramatically since 1948. Yet despite their growing presence and unique experiences, most military studies still center on men – even as women report higher rates of PTSD. Building on the need for focused research, Florida Atlantic University researchers, in collaboration with the University of Maryland School of Nursing, the Medical College of Georgia, and Warrior Canine Connection, Inc., conducted the study involving female veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. But instead of receiving service dogs, these women volunteered to train them for fellow veterans in need – offering support not just to others, but potentially to themselves. The study, supported by the National Institutes of Health’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development, examined whether this purposeful, mission-driven activity could reduce both biological and psychological stress, and whether previous combat exposure influenced those effects. Until now, the emotional and therapeutic benefits of such unique relationships have been largely unexamined in female veterans. To measure biological stress, researchers looked at telomere length (a marker of cellular aging) using saliva samples, and heart rate variability (HRV), a sign of nervous system balance, using wearable monitors in participants in the service dog training program group or a comparison group that watched dog training videos. Psychological stress was assessed using validated questionnaires measuring PTSD symptoms, perceived stress, and anxiety at multiple points during the study. Results, published in the journal Behavioral Sciences, revealed promising biological benefits associated with service dog training – particularly for veterans with combat experience – while improvements in psychological symptoms were seen across all participants, regardless of the intervention. One of the most striking findings involved telomere length. Veterans who participated in the dog-training program showed an increase in telomere length, suggesting a slowing of cellular aging. In contrast, those in the control group exhibited a decrease in telomere length, indicating accelerated aging. Combat experience significantly influenced these results: veterans with combat exposure who trained service dogs experienced the greatest gains in telomere length, whereas those with combat exposure in the control group saw the most pronounced declines. On the psychological front, both groups – those who trained dogs and those in the control group – reported significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, anxiety and perceived stress over the eight-week period. However, these mental health improvements were similar across groups, suggesting that simply participating in the study and receiving structured attention may have offered therapeutic value. Unlike the biological findings, psychological outcomes did not appear to be affected by combat exposure. “Female veterans face unique reintegration challenges that are often overlooked, and traditional PTSD treatments don’t always meet their needs,” said Cheryl Krause-Parello, Ph.D., first author, associate vice president for FAU research, associate executive director, FAU I-Health, and director of C-PAWW™. “Nontraditional approaches like connecting with animals can offer meaningful support. These relationships provide emotional safety and stability, which can be especially powerful for women. But not all veterans can care for a service animal, so animal-related volunteerism may offer similar healing benefits without the burden of ownership.” The study also suggests that the skills learned during service dog training – such as positive reinforcement and reading animal behavior – may have strengthened participants’ bonds with their own pets at home, offering additional emotional support. Unlike general volunteering, service dog training uniquely blends emotional healing with building a close relationship between veterans and their animals, providing therapeutic benefits that go beyond typical community engagement. “This research underscores the power of service dog training as a meaningful, non-pharmacological intervention to support the health and healing of female veterans with PTSD,” said Krause-Parello. “It opens the door to more personalized approaches that nurture both the mind and body.” Female veterans aged 32 to 72 were randomly assigned to either the service dog training program group or a comparison group that watched dog training videos. Both groups took part in one-hour sessions each week for eight weeks. Researchers measured outcomes before, during and after the program. These findings provide early evidence that non-pharmacological interventions – such as service dog training – may help reduce the physical toll of stress and slow cellular aging in female veterans.

    "headline": "Chatbots the New 'Doc?' Exploring AI in Health Behavior Coaching",
    "content": "Advances in artificial intelligence are opening new possibilities to bring motivational interviewing to more people through digital tools. Changing health habits – like quitting smoking, exercising more, or sticking to prescribed treatments – is difficult but crucial for preventing and managing chronic diseases. Motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered counseling method that helps people find their own motivation to change, has proven effective across many health care settings. Yet despite strong evidence, MI is not widely used in clinical practice due to challenges like limited time, training demands and payment barriers. Advances in artificial intelligence, however, are opening new possibilities to bring MI to more people through digital tools. AI-powered chatbots, apps and virtual agents can simulate the supportive, empathetic conversations at the heart of MI. Using approaches ranging from scripted dialogues to advanced large language models like GPT-4 (commonly known as ChatGPT), these tools provide around-the-clock, judgment-free support. They may be especially helpful for people who do not seek traditional behavioral health care. Early studies suggest these AI tools are feasible and acceptable, but it remains unclear how closely they follow core MI principles such as empathy and promoting autonomy, and whether they effectively change behaviors. Evaluating this “MI fidelity” is challenging, as traditional methods need detailed human review and don’t scale well. To fill these important knowledge gaps, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine conducted the first scoping review of studies on AI-driven systems designed to deliver motivational interviewing. They focused on exploring how AI tools such as chatbots and large language models are being used to deliver MI, what is known about their usability and acceptability, the extent to which these systems adhere to core MI principles, and the behavioral or psychological outcomes reported so far. Results, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, reveal that the most used AI tools were chatbots, with some virtual agents and mobile apps, using technologies ranging from rule-based systems to advanced models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. While all aimed to simulate motivational interviewing, the quality and rigor of their evaluations varied. Only a few studies addressed safety concerns around AI-generated content, with most not detailing safeguards against misinformation or inappropriate responses. While only a few studies reported actual behavioral changes, most focused on important psychological factors like readiness to change and feeling understood. Importantly, no studies looked at long-term behavioral outcomes, and follow-up periods were often short or missing entirely. So, while AI tools can effectively deliver motivational content and influence early signs of change, their ability to create lasting behavior shifts remains unclear. “Many digital interventions included motivational ‘elements’ but didn’t clearly show if or how they follow formal MI practices,” said Maria Carmenza Mejia, M.D., senior author and a professor of population health, Schimdt College of Medicine. “We carefully mapped the specific techniques used – like open-ended questions, affirmations, and reflective listening – and looked at how fidelity was assessed, whether through expert review or study design. This level of detail is essential to understand what these AI tools are actually doing and how well they mirror true motivational interviewing.” Findings show that despite their strengths, limitations around emotional nuance and conversational depth were commonly noted. “Users appreciated the convenience and structure of AI systems but often missed the ‘human touch’ and complex relational dynamics of face-to-face counseling,” said Mejia. Participants in the studies varied widely from general adults to college students and patients with specific health conditions. Smoking cessation was the most common focus, followed by substance use reduction, stress management, and other health behaviors. “AI-driven systems show exciting potential to deliver motivational interviewing and support meaningful health behavior change,” said Mejia. “These tools are feasible and well-accepted across various health issues, demonstrating key principles like empathy and collaboration. However, few studies have rigorously evaluated their impact on behavior or fidelity. As AI health interventions evolve, future research must focus on robust evaluation, transparency and ethical responsibility. By blending scalable AI technology with proven behavioral frameworks, we can expand access and better support patients facing behavior change challenges.” Study co-authors are FAU medical students Zev Karve, Jacob Caley, Christopher Machado and Michelle K.

    "headline": "FAU Joins Neuroarts Academic Network to Bridge Art, Brain and Healing",
    "content": "As a member of the Neuroarts Academic Network, FAU will amplify its ongoing efforts at the intersection of neuroscience, healing and the arts. Florida Atlantic University has joined the newly launched Neuroarts Academic Network (NAN), recently announced by the NeuroArts Blueprint Initiative. NAN is a global initiative aimed at expanding the transformative power of the arts – such as music, dance, painting and storytelling – by building the emerging interdisciplinary field of neuroarts and training the next generation of leaders. Building on research that demonstrates how art positively affects the brain and body, NAN will explore how creative expression can be embedded in mainstream medicine, public health and across society to improve health and well-being for all. FAU will help lead this groundbreaking global movement to harness the power of aesthetic experiences to enhance brain health and transform care across disciplines. FAU is one of only two universities in Florida – and one of more than 35 institutions worldwide – selected to join the network’s initial working group. “This is a significant step for Florida Atlantic University and for the emerging field of neuroarts,” said Randy Blakely, Ph.D., FAU designated official for NAN, executive director of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, the David J.S. Nicholson Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience, and a professor of biomedical science in the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine. “Building on the momentum of the NeuroArts Blueprint, joining NAN recognizes FAU for its commitment to programs to unite the arts with brain science and medicine. This commitment not only recognizes a growing movement but also opens a door to transformative research opportunities – particularly in understanding how aesthetic experience can impact brain health. We are proud to help shape a future where creativity and science work hand in hand to improve lives.” Blakely will lead the initiative in close collaboration with Nicole Baganz, Ph.D., director of community engagement and programming, FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, and academic collaborators across FAU and the broader community through the Program in Artistic Resilience, a key component of the soon to be launched FAU Center for the Resilient Mind. “The arts are not merely expressions of human experience – they are powerful tools for healing and neurobiological integration,” said Michael Horswell, Ph.D., dean of the Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, who will partner with Blakely to develop the Program in Artistic Resilience. “Decades of research demonstrate that engaging with the arts stimulates complex brain networks involved in emotion, memory and cognition. By joining this interdisciplinary network, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing scientific inquiry into how the arts promote both individual healing and the well-being of communities.” The partnership with NAN is designed to amplify FAU’s ongoing efforts at the intersection of neuroscience, healing and the arts. One signature event in this activity will be the Insights VIII Exhibition, opening Feb. 20, 2026, at the FAU Ritter Art Gallery – a partnership with Horswell and Veronique Côté, Ph.D., director of FAU Galleries. The exhibit, part of the Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute’s annual Brainy Days celebration, features work generated by artists living with bipolar disorder, illuminating the role of creative expression in developing resilience, heightening public understanding, and combatting stigma. As part of the NAN effort, the institute is also set to launch a pilot grant program to support innovative research at the crossroads of neuroscience and the arts – jump-starting collaborative projects that explore how creative disciplines such as music, dance, theater and the visual arts can influence brain function and health and support emotional well-being. “At this formative stage, the generous seed funding from the Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute is critical to launching collaborative research in neuroarts,” said Michael R. Dobbs, M.D., the first endowed FairfaxWood Chair of Clinical Neurosciences, chair and professor of the Clinical Neurosciences Department and associate dean of clinical affairs in the Schmidt College of Medicine. “This support may prove truly transformative – advancing our understanding of how artistic expression can be harnessed to improve brain health, enhance therapeutic outcomes and open new frontiers in treatment.” The NeuroArts Blueprint Initiative, which launched the NAN, is co-led by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s International Arts + Mind Lab Center for Applied Neuroaesthetics and the Aspen Institute’s Health, Medicine & Society Program, with support from The Music Man Foundation. The initiative is co-directed by Susan Magsamen, executive director of the International Arts + Mind Lab at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Ruth J. Katz, executive director of the Health, Medicine & Society Program at the Aspen Institute. “Neuroarts is a vibrant, interdisciplinary field grounded in evidence-based knowledge and united by shared research principles, practices and values. To fully realize its potential, we must learn from one another, develop a common language, and build a collaborative framework that enables our disciplines to flourish individually while also working together to build the field,” said Magsamen. The network’s goal is to establish neuroarts as a rigorous academic and professional field that bridges arts, health, basic sciences, public policy and community engagement. “In these challenging times of rapid change, the Neuroarts Academic Network offers a bold, collaborative model to strengthen neuroarts education, workforce development and interdisciplinary impact,” said Katz. “It is essential to advancing this important and game-changing work.” The Insights VIII exhibit, presented in partnership with the Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation, will run from Feb. 20 to March 6, 2026, and will feature more than 40 works selected from more than 200 national submissions. According to Blakely, several artists whose work will be displayed in the exhibit will be in attendance across the span of the exhibit with hopes of sharing insights into their process and goals for artistic expression. “Our inclusion in the Neuroarts Academic Network reinforces our commitment to interdisciplinary innovation, public health impact, and the belief that science and the arts have much to inform the other along the road to human vitality,” said Blakely.

    "headline": "Study First to Show if Nesting Heat Affects Sea Turtle Hatchling 'IQ'",
    "content": "A loggerhead hatchling goes through the Y-maze to test its learning abilities. (Photo credit: Sarah Milton, Florida Atlantic University) As sand temperatures continue to rise, concerns about the future of sea turtles are growing. Hotter nests not only skew sex ratios – producing more females – but also reduce hatchling survival, slow growth, and increase the likelihood of physical deformities. Yet one important and often overlooked question remains: does this heat also affect cognitive ability – how well hatchlings can learn, adapt and respond to the rapidly changing world they face from the moment they emerge? A new study by researchers at Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science offers a surprising glimmer of hope. They are the first to test whether incubation temperature affects cognitive ability in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) hatchlings – how well they can learn, adapt and problem-solve. While animal cognition has been widely studied in birds and mammals, much is yet to be discovered in reptiles. Using a Y-maze and a visual discrimination task, the researchers trained hatchlings incubated at two female-producing temperatures (88 F and a hotter 91 F) and then tested their ability to “reverse train” when the task rules changed. Eggs were collected during the summers of 2019 and 2020 from nesting beaches in Palm Beach County. In the initial acquisition phase of training, approximately four weeks after the turtles hatched, they were trained to associate a food reward with a specific monochromatic pattern such as stripes or a bullseye, which were positioned at the ends of the maze. In the reversal phase, the reward pattern was switched, requiring the turtles to abandon the original association and learn that they would need to go to a different target for the reward. This reversal task measured behavioral flexibility – the ability to adapt to new information, which may be essential for survival in dynamic environments like the ocean. Unexpectedly, the study results published in the journal Endangered Species Research found no significant differences in learning ability between the temperature groups. In both years, hatchlings from both temperature treatments were able to successfully complete the acquisition and reversal tasks. In 2020, they even performed significantly better during the reversal phase, learning faster than they had during initial training. “Not only were the post-hatchlings capable of suppressing previously learned behaviors to form new, more advantageous associations, they were able to do so with remarkable speed – often requiring fewer trials than the initial learning phase,” said Sarah L. Milton, Ph.D., senior author and chair and professor in the FAU Department of Biological Sciences. “This surprising level of behavioral flexibility suggests that these young turtles may be better equipped to navigate and adapt to rapidly changing environmental challenges than we previously understood. Such adaptability could prove crucial for their survival in an increasingly unpredictable world.” However, findings also revealed that higher incubation temperatures negatively affected several key physical traits. Hatchlings from the 91 F nests had shorter incubation durations, lower hatching success, slower post-hatch growth, and more frequent scute anomalies – defects in the scales of their shell. They were also smaller – an outcome that could compromise swimming performance and predator evasion. “The concern remains very real,” said Ivana J. Lezcano, corresponding author and a doctoral candidate in FAU’s Department of Biological Sciences. “Elevated incubation temperatures are known to produce smaller, less physically resilient hatchlings and cause a significant decline in overall hatching success. Together, this can pose serious risks to population survival. However, our finding that cognitive ability and learning may remain largely unaffected, at least in the short-term, by these higher temperatures offers a hopeful perspective. It suggests that, despite other developmental and physical challenges, these turtles may retain the mental flexibility needed to adapt to their changing environments. This resilience gives us one of the first glimpses of how incubation temperature may affect behavioral traits, though ongoing research is essential to fully understand the long-term implications.” The researchers stress that while these results are encouraging, they come with caveats. The study only examined temperatures up to 91 F, and nesting beaches in South Florida have already recorded sand temperatures exceeding 93 F to almost 96 F – levels known to severely affect hatching success and hatchling performance. More extreme temperatures could still pose risks to brain development and cognition that weren’t evident at the sublethal range tested here. Furthermore, while a nest in the field is typically considered “successful” if the majority of the hatchlings emerge from it, the study suggests that survival models may need to go beyond emergence rates and factor in hatchling quality – physical and behavioral alike. “The hatchlings in our study were able to swiftly adjust to new information despite developmental stressors,” said Milton. “This behavioral adaptability is not just a survival mechanism – it’s a critical evolutionary advantage that may enable them to cope with the complex challenges posed by their shifting habitats. Conservation efforts must prioritize not only the preservation of hatchling populations but also the environmental conditions that support their ongoing cognitive development and resilience.” As sea turtle embryos are so strongly influenced by the thermal conditions of their nest, understanding how temperature affects not just who survives but how well they are equipped for survival is critical. This research was supported by the FAU School of Environmental, Coastal, and Ocean Sustainability within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. Hatchlings were trained to associate a food reward with a specific pattern such as a bullseye at the end of a Y-maze. In the reversal phase, the reward was switched to a different pattern, requiring them to relearn the association.

    "headline": "FAU Lands EPA Grant to Use Genetics in Florida Bay Sponge Restoration",
    "content": "Andia Chaves-Fonnegra, Ph.D., principal investigator, conducting research in the field. Andia Chaves-Fonnegra, Ph.D., an associate professor of biology at Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College, has been awarded a five-year, $720,446 grant from the United States EPA to support a pioneering project aimed at restoring sponge populations in Florida Bay through a genetics-based approach. Florida Bay is a shallow body of water between the southern tip of mainland Florida and the Florida Keys. It is part of Everglades National Park, which supports important marine life like sponges, fish and spiny lobster. The project marks the first genetic assessment of sponge restoration efforts in the region and seeks to build long-term ecological resilience in one of the nation’s most vulnerable marine environments. Sponges are a vital component of benthic, hard-bottom communities throughout Florida Bay and the Florida reef tract. These organisms perform essential ecological functions – filtering vast volumes of water, cycling nutrients such as nitrogen, stabilizing seafloor sediments, and providing habitat for a variety of marine species. Among the most economically important is the spiny lobster, which depends on sponge-rich environments as nursery grounds. Although we may not think of sponges as important or charismatic animals, they support a multi-million-dollar lobster fishery in South Florida. In addition, two of the sponge species in the study are commercial bath sponges, which, on their own, also supported the highly successful sponge fishery industry before the introduction of plastic sponges and the collapse of their populations. The degradation of sponge communities has had cascading impacts on both the sponge and lobster fisheries, as well as on the broader ecosystem services that sponges provide. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in restoring sponge populations through transplantation programs that use asexual cuttings. These efforts, spearheaded by a coalition of scientists, state agencies, and community partners, have helped to reestablish sponge cover in areas heavily impacted by disease, phytoplankton blooms, and cold-water events. However, because these transplants are clonal, they lack genetic diversity, limiting the resilience of restored populations to environmental stressors and reducing their capacity to adapt to shifts in weather patterns. Chaves-Fonnegra’s research will address this critical limitation by integrating population genetics into restoration strategies. Her team will analyze the genetic structure and diversity of four key sponge species currently used in Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) restoration programs: Spongia Barbara – a type of bath sponge known for its soft textures, Spongia graminea – referred to as the grass sponge, Ircinia campana – known as the vase sponge because of its shape, and Spheciospongia vesparium – commonly called the loggerhead sponge. Using advanced tools such as microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms, the researchers will evaluate genetic diversity, inbreeding levels, clonality, and reproductive success in both nursery and outplant sites. This innovative project will also examine the degree to which restored sponges are reproducing sexually with wild populations and whether their offspring are genetically diverse enough to withstand the pressures of a warming ocean. “Receiving this EPA grant is incredibly significant because it means that we can move from simply rebuilding sponge numbers to restoring sponge populations with the genetic strength to withstand a shifting climate, disease, and other growing threats,” said Chaves-Fonnegra, principal investigator. “For the region, that means more stable fisheries, healthier reef ecosystems, clearer waters, and a safeguard for communities and businesses that depend on a thriving Florida Bay. It’s not just science – it’s an investment in resilience, for our ecosystems and for our people.” Florida’s coral reef ecosystems, which include reefs, hard-bottom habitats, and sponge communities, support more than $1 billion annually in tourism and recreational activities. Reef-related fishing generates more than $150 million in sales each year, and tens of thousands of jobs across the state depend on the health of these marine systems. As Florida’s coastal ecosystems face increasing threats, restoration efforts must evolve to ensure they are both effective and adaptive. Through this work, FAU is helping to shape the future of marine conservation in Florida, integrating science, policy, and innovation to protect one of the state’s most ecologically and economically valuable natural resources.

    "headline": "Single Drug Shows Promise to Treat PTSD, Pain, and Alcohol Misuse",
    "content": "PTSD affects about 12 million U.S. adults, with veterans hit especially hard – and many also grappling with alcohol use disorder and chronic pain. These conditions often overlap and fuel each other, making treatment complex and largely ineffective. (Photo by Alex Dolce) About 12 million adults in the United States are affected by PTSD, impacting between 4% and 8% of the adult population – and up to 30% of military personnel and veterans. Strikingly, 63% of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) and/or chronic pain. These conditions frequently overlap, with individuals who have AUD or chronic pain often also experiencing PTSD. When these disorders co-occur, they tend to worsen one another, making effective treatment significantly more challenging. Currently, no approved medications effectively treat PTSD and AUD together, and many available drugs come with serious side effects or limited results. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, in collaboration with the University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy, conducted two complementary studies in rats to explore how a new drug, PPL-138, might help treat PTSD and its common companions – anxiety, chronic pain, and AUD. A type of opioid partial agonist, PPL-138 works by targeting specific opioid receptors in the brain. Intellectual property related to PPL-138 is owned by Phoenix PharmaLabs, Inc. The company is in the process of advancing PPL-138 through clinical trials. The first study, carried out at the University of Oklahoma, looked at whether long-term treatment with PPL-138 could reduce PTSD-related symptoms in chronic traumatic stress. The second study, conducted at FAU, focused on the relationship between trauma, anxiety and alcohol use, and researchers divided rats into different groups. Results, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, provide promising evidence that PPL-138 could become a valuable treatment for PTSD and alcohol misuse – particularly when symptoms are rooted in anxiety. By targeting a brain system involved in both stress and addiction, researchers believe PPL-138 may one day offer a much-needed breakthrough for those struggling with these life-altering conditions. Findings show that PPL-138 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior, pain responses, and alcohol consumption – but only in rats that developed PTSD-like symptoms. In both male and female rats, the drug selectively reduced alcohol use in those that also showed signs of trauma-related anxiety, without affecting those that were resilient or not stressed. “Our results show that PPL-138 not only reduces trauma-related anxiety and pain, but also selectively curbs alcohol use in rats most vulnerable to stress-induced drinking,” said Andrea Cippitelli, Ph.D., lead author and an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Science within the Schmidt College of Medicine and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute. “This kind of targeted treatment could transform how we manage PTSD and its comorbidities – especially for the large number of patients who currently fall through the cracks of existing therapies.” The study findings also emphasize the need to consider sex differences in both the causes and treatment of these overlapping conditions. Among female rats, PPL-138 reduced alcohol intake in those exhibiting anxiety, even if their drinking had not escalated. This indicates that anxiety alone may be a primary factor driving alcohol use in females. “Anxious male rats were twice as likely as females to increase their alcohol intake following trauma, while nearly all female rats with more alcohol intake also displayed clear signs of anxiety,” said Cippitelli. “This mirrors well-documented patterns in humans, where women are more prone to anxiety-related disorders like PTSD and often use alcohol to cope with emotional distress, whereas men typically engage in heavier, more generalized drinking.” Importantly, the effects of PPL-138 were not due to sedation or reduced activity. The compound did not alter movement or alcohol consumption in rats with anxiety-related behaviors or traumatic stress. In fact, movement levels remained unchanged in male rats and slightly increased in females – supporting the idea that the drug acts specifically on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, rather than causing general suppression or sedation. “This research represents a much-needed step toward helping both civilians and veterans living with the invisible wounds of trauma,” said Cippitelli. “In our preclinical studies, PPL-138 shows strong potential as a single therapy for the overlapping symptoms of PTSD, chronic pain, and alcohol misuse – offering a potentially safer and more effective alternative to current multi-drug approaches.” Study co-authors are Yong Zhang, Ph.D., University of Oklahoma College of Pharmacy; Kyle Kealoha, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Ali Idriss, former research lab technician, FAU Department of Biomedical Science; Panini S.

    "headline": "FAU Engineers Create Smarter AI to Redefine Control in Complex Systems",
    "content": "A new AI framework improves management of complex systems with unequal decision-makers, like smart grids, traffic networks, and autonomous vehicles. A new artificial intelligence breakthrough developed by researchers in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University offers a smarter, more efficient way to manage complex systems that rely on multiple decision-makers operating at different levels of authority. This novel framework, recently published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems, could significantly impact the future of smart energy grids, traffic networks and autonomous vehicle systems – technologies that are becoming increasingly central to daily life. In many real-world systems, decisions don’t happen simultaneously or equally. A utility company might decide when to cut power during peak hours, and households must adjust their energy use in response. In traffic systems, central controllers dictate signals while vehicles adapt accordingly. “These types of systems operate under a power hierarchy, where one player makes the first move and others must follow, and they’re more complicated than typical AI models assume,” said Zhen Ni, Ph.D., senior author, IEEE senior member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Traditional AI methods often treat every decision-maker as equal, operating at the same time with the same level of influence. While this makes for clean simulations, it doesn’t reflect how decisions are actually made in real-world scenarios – especially in environments full of uncertainty, limited bandwidth and uneven access to information.” To address this, Ni and Xiangnan Zhong, Ph.D., first author, IEEE member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, designed a new AI framework based on reinforcement learning, a technique that allows intelligent agents to learn from interacting with their environment over time. Their approach adds two key innovations. First, it structures the decision-making process using a game theory model called the Stackelberg-Nash game, where a “leader” agent acts first and “follower” agents respond in an optimal way. This hierarchy better mirrors systems like energy management, connected transportation and autonomous driving. Second, the researchers introduced an event-triggered mechanism that reduces the computational burden. “Instead of constantly updating decisions at every time step, which is typical of many AI systems, our method updates decisions only when necessary, saving energy and processing power while maintaining performance and stability,” said Zhong. The result is a system that not only handles the power asymmetry between decision-makers but also deals with mismatched uncertainties – cases where different players operate with varying levels of information and predictability. This is especially critical in environments like smart grids or traffic control systems, where conditions change rapidly and resources are often limited. The framework allows for a more robust, adaptive and scalable form of AI control that can make better use of limited bandwidth and computing resources. “This work fills a crucial gap in the current AI landscape. By developing a method that reflects real-world decision hierarchies and adapts to imperfect information, Professors Zhong and Ni are helping us move closer to practical, intelligent systems that can handle the complexity of our modern infrastructure,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “The implications of this research are far-reaching. Whether it’s optimizing power consumption across cities or making autonomous systems more reliable, this kind of innovation is foundational to the future of intelligent technology. It represents a step forward not just for AI research, but for the everyday systems we depend on.” Backed by rigorous theoretical analysis and validated through simulation studies, Zhong and Ni demonstrated that their event-triggered reinforcement learning method maintains system stability, ensures optimal strategy outcomes and effectively reduces unnecessary computation. The approach combines deep control theory with practical machine learning, offering a compelling path forward for intelligent control in asymmetric, uncertain environments.

    "headline": "Decoding a Decade of Grouper Grunts Unlocks Spawning Secrets, Shifts",
    "content": "A red hind grouper, which produces sounds associated with courtship, territoriality or mating. More than a decade of acoustic recordings of grouper grunts are providing new insight into how sound can be used to monitor and manage vulnerable fish populations. The research by Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute focused on the red hind (Epinephelus guttatus), a commercially important Caribbean grouper species. Red hind are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as females and later becoming males. Each winter, they travel more than 30 kilometers to offshore sites to spawn under the full moon in large gatherings. Males use rhythmic, low-frequency sounds to attract mates and to defend territory. This predictable behavior makes them especially vulnerable to overfishing during spawning season. Rather than traditional survey methods, FAU Harbor Branch and FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science researchers, in collaboration with HJR Reefscaping, the University of the Virgin Islands, and the University of Puerto Rico, turned to passive acoustic monitoring. This technique enables continuous, long-term monitoring of reproductive behavior, even in remote or hard-to-access areas, without disrupting the animals or their habitat. To examine how red hind reproductive behavior has changed over time, researchers analyzed more than 2,000 hours of underwater recordings from a single spawning site off Puerto Rico’s west coast, continuously monitored since 2007. Unlike most acoustic studies that track general sound levels, this research focused on specific mating calls tied to distinct behaviors. Red hind produce two primary sound types – one for courtship and another for territorial defense. Tracking these sounds over time allowed researchers to detect subtle shifts in spawning behavior and population dynamics. The result, published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, is one of the most extensive and uninterrupted acoustic datasets ever assembled for a reef fish species. The analysis confirmed a consistent seasonal pattern in red hind spawning activity, closely aligned with lunar cycles. However, one of the most striking findings was a notable shift in the balance of call types over the 12-year period. Between 2011 and 2017, calls linked to courtship were more common. But starting in 2018, calls linked to competition and territorial behavior became dominant – nearly tripling over the study period. “This shift could indicate changes in the population, such as an increase in the number of older or more dominant males, changes in sex ratios, or even a shift in the core spawning area,” said Laurent Chérubin, Ph.D., lead author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch. Researchers also observed more frequent and multiple peaks in sound production in recent years, suggesting that spawning may now be spread over more days in each lunar cycle than in the past. These changes could be responses to environmental or population shifts. Importantly, the study shows that passive acoustic monitoring can be a powerful tool for tracking reproductive behavior over time and detecting early signs of population or behavioral change – information that is critical for managing and conserving red hind and similar reef fish species. “What’s remarkable is that even a single underwater microphone can reveal so much about fish populations,” said Chérubin. “With consistent long-term monitoring, we can pick up early warning signs – like shifts in spawning behavior or population stress – and give resource managers the information they need to adapt conservation strategies before it’s too late.” At the center of the analysis was an advanced machine-learning tool called FADAR (fish acoustic detection algorithm research). This custom-built acoustic classifier allowed the team to detect and distinguish between different types of mating calls with extraordinary speed and accuracy. “This study shows how much we can learn simply by listening,” said Chérubin. “Thanks to FADAR, we processed 12 years of acoustic data in weeks – uncovering patterns that would have taken years to find. It’s a game changer for monitoring and managing reef fish like red hind.” “As passive acoustics advances, it’s transforming our understanding of the ocean,” said Chérubin. “By tuning in to underwater soundscapes, we’re discovering not just when and where fish spawn, but how those patterns change over time – offering vital insights into the health of marine ecosystems.” Study co-authors are Caroline Woodward, United States Geological Survey; Michelle Schärer-Umpierre, Ph.D., associate researcher, HJR Reefscaping and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez; Richard S.

    "headline": "FAU/Baptist Health AI Spine Model Could Transform Back Pain Treatment",
    "content": "Nearly 3 in 10 adults in the U.S. have experienced lower back pain in any three-month period, making it the most common musculoskeletal pain. Nearly 3 in 10 adults in the United States have experienced lower back pain in any three-month period, making it the most common musculoskeletal pain. Back pain remains one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting millions and often leading to chronic discomfort, missed work and invasive procedures. Researchers and clinicians are increasingly turning to lumbar spine modeling, which bridges engineering and medicine, creating a virtual, patient-specific model of the lower back. This technology simulates how the spine moves, where mechanical stress builds up, and what might be causing pain or dysfunction. These detailed models are used to plan surgeries, evaluate spinal implants and develop personalized treatment strategies tailored to each patient’s anatomy. Despite its promise, current lumbar spine modeling is slow, manual and demands specialized expertise, limiting scalability and personalization. This hinders clinical application and results in inconsistent outcomes. Researchers from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University and the Marcus Neuroscience Institute at Boca Raton Regional Hospital, part of Baptist Health, have reached a major milestone in lumbar spine modeling by integrating artificial intelligence with biomechanics to transform spine diagnostics and personalized treatment planning. They are the first to create a fully automated finite element analysis pipeline specifically for lumbar spine modeling. Their breakthrough involves integrating deep learning tools like nnUNet and MONAI with biomechanical simulators such as GIBBON and FEBio. Results of the study, published in the journal World Neurosurgery, show that this new approach reduced lumbar spine model preparation time by 97.9% – from more than 24 hours to just 30 minutes and 49 seconds – without compromising biomechanical accuracy. The fully automated pipeline enables rapid, patient-specific simulations that support preoperative planning, spinal implant optimization and early detection of degenerative spine conditions. Tests showed that the virtual spine reacted just like a real one, with realistic disc movement, ligament tension and pressure in the back of the spine during bending and stretching. Because the system runs with very little manual work, it’s much faster and more consistent than traditional methods, making it a valuable tool for doctors and researchers alike. “What sets our approach apart is its ability to automatically convert standard medical images like CT or MRI scans into highly accurate, patient-specific spine models,” said Maohua Lin, Ph.D., corresponding author and a research assistant professor, FAU Department of Biomedical Engineering. “Traditional manual methods require complex geometry processing, meshing and finite element simulation setup, making them not only time-intensive but also highly dependent on the operator’s expertise. Our automated pipeline significantly reduces the time required, cutting what once took several hours or even days down to just minutes.” For the study, researchers used advanced AI to automatically identify important parts of the spine – like bones and discs – from medical scans. These were then turned into smooth 3D models that included bones, cartilage and ligaments. They mapped where the ligaments attach and shaped the cartilage based on common patterns. Lastly, researchers ran computer simulations to see how the spine responds to movements like bending and twisting, helping them understand where stress builds up and how the spine moves in real life. “Beyond advancing research, automated lumbar spine modeling plays a critical role in preoperative planning,” said Frank D. Vrionis, M.D., corresponding author and chief of neurosurgery at Marcus Neuroscience Institute. “This technology quickly generates patient-specific models to predict mechanical complications, optimize implant design and reduce surgical risks. By removing manual steps, it also improves speed and consistency, helping clinicians make more informed decisions.” This research builds upon previous work by the research team published in leading journals including Artificial Intelligence Review and the North American Spine Society Journal, investigating related AI-driven biomechanical modeling techniques. “This groundbreaking work exemplifies the game-changing power of uniting engineering and medicine to address complex health care challenges,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science. “FAU and Baptist Health researchers are not only pushing the boundaries of innovation, they are also delivering real-world solutions that can improve patient outcomes and redefine spine care.” Study co-authors are Mohsen Ahmadi, a Ph.D. student in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; Xuanzong Zhang, an American Heritage High School student; Yufei Tang, Ph.D., an associate professor, FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and FAU Sensing Institute fellow; Erik Engeberg, Ph.D., a professor, FAU Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Ocean and Mechanical Engineering, a member of the FAU Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences within the Charles E.

    "headline": "Researchers Show How Healthy Habits Can Improve Cognitive Decline",
    "content": "Up to 45% of dementia risk is linked to modifiable factors like poor diet, inactivity and isolation. An estimated 7.2 million Americans over age 65 currently live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). That number is expected to nearly double to 13.8 million by 2060. These increases reflect more than demographic shifts; they point to a growing public health crisis that requires a new, proactive approach. While chronological age is the strongest known risk factor for cognitive decline, losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging. As AD and other forms of cognitive decline continue to rise at an alarming rate, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, highlight a powerful and untapped path to prevention. In a commentary published in The American Journal of Medicine, the researchers urge clinicians, public health professionals and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts to support lifestyle-based interventions that can help reduce the growing burden of cognitive decline in the United States and worldwide. “While deaths from cardiovascular disease have declined since 2000, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease have surged by more than 140%,” said Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., FACPM, FACC, co-author, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine, and senior academic advisor, Schmidt College of Medicine. “At the same time, it is estimated that up to 45% of dementia risk could be attributed to modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors.” Lifestyle risk factors like physical inactivity, poor diet, obesity, alcohol use, and conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, depression, and social or intellectual isolation are believed to contribute to cognitive decline. The authors point out that the same therapeutic lifestyle changes proven effective for reducing risks of cardiovascular and other major diseases may also help reduce cognitive decline – potentially with additive effects when multiple risk factors are present. The commentary highlights the recently published results from POINTER, the first large-scale U.S-based randomized trial to test whether intensive lifestyle changes can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults at high risk of decline. In this trial, participants who were assigned at random to a structured, team-based lifestyle intervention showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. These gains were especially notable in executive functions such as memory, attention, planning and decision-making. The intervention emphasized regular physical activity, a combination of Mediterranean and DASH-style diets, cognitive stimulation and social engagement – reinforced through ongoing professional guidance and group support. These findings are similar to an earlier Finnish trial, the FINGER trial, in which participants with elevated cardiovascular risk scores assigned at random to a multidomain lifestyle approach experienced cognitive benefits. “The data from both these landmark, large scale randomized trials demonstrate that lifestyle changes – previously shown to reduce heart disease and cancer – also hold transformative potential for brain health,” Hennekens said. The researchers also speculated about biological mechanisms that may underlie these benefits. Physical activity, for example, increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which supports hippocampal growth, while also improving blood flow and reducing inflammation. Healthy dietary patterns like the Mediterranean and DASH diets can lower oxidative stress and improve insulin sensitivity as well as risks of cardiovascular disease. Quitting smoking may help preserve brain structure and white matter integrity, and regular social and cognitive engagement promotes neuroplasticity and mental resilience. “The implications for clinical practice, public health and government policy are potentially enormous,” said Parvathi Perumareddi, D.O., co-author and an associate professor of family medicine in the Schmidt College of Medicine. “Clinicians now have powerful, evidence-based tools to help their patients prevent or slow cognitive decline – tools that go beyond medications, are generally low-risk, and are cost-effective. Public health agencies could adopt the framework of trials like POINTER and FINGER to develop brain health programs.” On the policy front, the researchers note that potential cost savings are large, particularly when considering the high price and limited effectiveness of many new pharmacologic agents, which may cause common and less serious side effects like nausea, headache and fatigue, as well as more rare but more serious risks like confusion or gastrointestinal bleeding. Modeling studies suggest that reducing key risk factors by even 10% to 20% each decade could lower the burden of cognitive decline by up to 15%. Beyond the health care system, the societal costs of dementia are staggering. In 2024, nearly 12 million family members and unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to individuals living with dementia – amounting to a societal cost of more than $413 billion. Caregiving also takes an emotional toll, often resulting in mental health challenges and caregiver burnout. The researchers emphasize that these realities underscore the need for practical, community-based solutions that support both patients and caregivers and reduce the long-term burden on families and the economy. “While more research is needed, the current totality of evidence supports a clear path forward: invest in lifestyle-based strategies to protect brain health,” said Hennekens. “Doing so will not only benefit individuals at risk but also serve as a powerful tool for reducing national and global health care burdens related to cognitive decline.” The first and corresponding author is John Dunn, a medical student at the Schmidt College of Medicine.
