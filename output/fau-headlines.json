    "headline": "'Frazzled' Fruit Flies Help Unravel How Neural Circuits Stay Wired",
    "content": "Extreme close-up of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) using scanning electron microscopy. Study Snapshot: Florida Atlantic University neuroscientists have identified a surprising new role for a protein called “Frazzled” (DCC in humans) in helping fruit fly neurons connect and communicate at lightning speed. Studying the Giant Fiber System, which controls the flies’ rapid escape reflex, they found that when Frazzled is missing or mutated, neurons fail to form proper electrical connections, slowing neural responses and weakening muscle control. Using genetic tools, the researchers showed that the intracellular portion of Frazzled alone could restore normal communication, revealing that this part of the protein regulates the genes needed to build gap junctions. Florida Atlantic University neuroscientists have uncovered a surprising role for a protein named “Frazzled” (known as DCC in mammals) in the nervous system of fruit flies, showing how it helps neurons connect and communicate with lightning speed. The discovery sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms that ensure neurons form reliable connections, or synapses, a process essential for all nervous systems, from insects to humans. In the study, researchers focused on the Giant Fiber (GF) System of Drosophila, a neural circuit that controls this fruit fly’s rapid escape reflex. With this work, the team has not only revealed a key molecular player in fruit fly neural circuits but also demonstrated the power of combining genetics, imaging, physiology and computational modeling to uncover how brains stay wired – and what happens when they don’t. The results, published in the journal eNeuro, reveal that when Frazzled is missing or mutated, the system falters: neurons fail to form proper electrical connections, the fly’s neural responses slow down, and communication between the GF neurons and the muscles they control weakens. These defects are linked to a loss of gap junctions, tiny channels that allow neurons to transmit signals directly and rapidly. In particular, the team found that the loss of a protein called shaking-B(neural+16), which forms these junctions in the presynaptic terminals, underlies much of the misfiring. To understand Frazzled’s precise role, the researchers used a genetic tool known as the UAS-GAL4 system to reintroduce different pieces of the Frazzled protein into mutant flies. Strikingly, just the intracellular portion of Frazzled – the part inside the neuron that can influence gene expression – was enough to restore both the structure of the synapses and the speed of neuronal communication. When this portion was disrupted, such as by deleting a key domain called P3 or mutating a crucial site within it, the rescue failed, indicating that Frazzled’s control of gene activity is essential for building gap junctions. Beyond laboratory experiments, the team also created a computational model of the GF System, simulating how the number of gap junctions affects the neurons’ ability to fire reliably. The model confirmed that even small changes in gap junction density can drastically alter the speed and precision of neural signals. “The combination of experimental and computational work allowed us to see not just that Frazzled matters, but exactly how it shapes the connections that let neurons talk to each other,” said Rodney Murphey, Ph.D., senior author and a professor of biological sciences in the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Our next steps are to explore whether similar mechanisms control neural circuits in other species, including mammals, and to see how this might influence learning, memory or even repair after injury.” Interestingly, while Frazzled has long been studied as a guidance molecule – helping neurons grow along the correct paths – the study revealed that its intracellular domain also directly regulates synapse formation. Flies lacking Frazzled often showed neurons that grew in random directions, failing to reach their targets. Restoring the intracellular domain corrected many of these guidance errors, demonstrating a dual role for Frazzled in both wiring neurons and fine-tuning their communication. This work also draws parallels to other organisms. Similar proteins in worms and vertebrates have been shown to influence chemical synapses, suggesting that Frazzled and its relatives may play a broadly conserved role in shaping neural networks. By showing how a single protein controls both the physical and functional aspects of electrical synapses, this study opens a window into the fundamental rules governing nervous system assembly. “Understanding how neurons form reliable connections is a central question in neuroscience,” Murphey said. “Frazzled gives us a clear handle on one piece of that puzzle. Our findings could inform future studies of neural development, neurodegenerative diseases and strategies to repair damaged circuits.” Study co-authors are first author Juan Lopez, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science; Jana Boerner, Ph.D., managing director of the Advanced Cell Imaging Core within the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute; Kelli Robbins, research staff in FAU’s Department of Biological Sciences; and Rodrigo Pena, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biological sciences in the Charles E.

    "headline": "FAU Researchers Make Great 'Strides' in Gait Analysis Technology",
    "content": "Microsoft’s Azure Kinect depth camera captures 3D data, color images and body movements for motion tracking. Study Snapshot: A first-of-its-kind study explored whether more accessible technologies – foot-mounted wearable sensors and a 3D depth camera – could accurately measure how people walk, offering a practical alternative to traditional gait analysis tools. Gait, or walking pattern, is a key health indicator used to detect fall risk, monitor rehabilitation and identify early signs of conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Traditional systems like the Zeno™ Walkway, the gold standard for gait analysis, are accurate but expensive, bulky and not easily used outside of lab settings. The researchers tested three systems side-by-side in a real clinical environment: wearable foot sensors, the Microsoft Azure Kinect depth camera, and the Zeno™ Walkway. They found that the foot-mounted sensors and depth camera matched the gold standard’s accuracy across most gait metrics, even in complex settings with people moving in the background. In contrast, lower-back sensors were less reliable. These results suggest that wearable and camera-based systems could make detailed gait analysis more scalable, cost-effective and suitable for remote or routine clinical use. A study from the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) at Florida Atlantic University reveals that foot-mounted wearable sensors and a 3D depth camera can accurately measure how people walk – even in busy clinical environments – offering a powerful and more accessible alternative to traditional gait assessment tools. Gait, the pattern of how a person walks, is an increasingly important marker of overall health, used in detecting fall risk, monitoring rehabilitation, and identifying early signs of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Although electronic walkways like the Zeno™ Walkway have long been considered the gold standard for gait analysis, their high cost, large footprint and limited portability restrict widespread use – especially outside controlled lab settings. To overcome these barriers, FAU researchers and collaborators conducted the first known study to simultaneously evaluate three different sensing technologies: APDM wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs); Microsoft’s’ Azure Kinect depth camera; and the Zeno™ Walkway – under identical, real-world clinical conditions. The depth-sensing camera captures 3D data, color images, and body movements for use in AI, robotics and motion tracking. The study findings, published in the journal Sensors, reveal that foot-mounted IMUs and the Azure Kinect not only match the accuracy of traditional tools but also enable scalable, remote and cost-effective gait analysis. “This is the first time these three technologies have been directly compared side by side in the same clinical setting,” said Behnaz Ghoraani, Ph.D., senior author and an associate professor in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and an I-SENSE fellow. “We wanted to answer a question the field has been asking for a long time: Can more accessible tools like wearables and markerless cameras reliably match the clinical standard for detailed gait analysis? The answer is yes – especially when it comes to foot-mounted sensors and the Azure Kinect.” The study recruited 20 adults aged 52 to 82, who completed both single-task and dual-task walking trials – a method often used to mimic real-world walking conditions that require multitasking or divided attention. Each participant’s gait was captured by the three systems at the same time, thanks to a custom-built hardware platform the FAU researchers developed, which precisely synchronized all data sources to the millisecond. Researchers evaluated 11 different gait markers, including basic metrics like walking speed and step frequency, as well as more detailed indicators such as stride time, support phases and swing time. These markers were analyzed using statistical methods to compare each device’s measurements with those from the Zeno™ Walkway. The results were clear: foot-mounted sensors showed near-perfect agreement with the walkway across nearly all gait markers. The Azure Kinect also performed impressively, maintaining strong accuracy even in the complex, real-world clinic setting where multiple people, including caregivers and staff, were present in the camera’s field of view. In contrast, lumbar-mounted sensors, which are commonly used in wearable gait studies, demonstrated significantly lower accuracy and consistency, particularly for fine-grained gait cycle events. Many studies use lower-back sensors because they are easy to mount. However, data from this study shows that they often fail to capture the details clinicians care most about – especially timing-based markers that can reveal early signs of neurological problems. “By testing these tools in a realistic clinical environment with all the unpredictable visual noise that comes with it, we’ve made great strides toward validating them for everyday use,” said Ghoraani. “This isn’t just a lab experiment. These technologies are ready to meet real-world demands.” Importantly, the study is the first to benchmark the Azure Kinect against an electronic walkway for micro-temporal gait markers – filling a critical gap in the literature and confirming the device’s potential clinical value. “The implications of this research are far-reaching,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science. “As health care systems increasingly embrace telehealth and remote monitoring, scalable technologies like wearable foot sensors and depth cameras are emerging as powerful tools. They enable clinicians to track mobility, detect early signs of functional decline, and tailor interventions – without the need for costly, space-intensive equipment.” Study co-authors are first author Marjan Nassajpour and Mahmoud Seifallahi, both doctoral students in the FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science; and Amie Rosenfeld, a physical therapist researcher and assistant director of education; Magdalena I. Tolea, Ph.D., research assistant professor of neurology and associate director of research; and James E. Galvin, M.D., professor of neurology, chief, Division of Neurology, and director, Comprehensive Center for Brain Health, all with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

    "headline": "FAU Historian Traces How U.S. Nursing Homes Evolved into Big Business",
    "content": "Postcard showing a typical Americana Nursing Center design, as employed in the facility that opened in Normal, Illinois in 1962 (author’s private collection). Study Snapshot: In a new article, historian Willa Granger, Ph.D., explores how a little-known Illinois company, the Americana Corporation, helped shape the modern nursing home in postwar America. During the 1960s, Americana developed a replicable model of suburban, hospital-adjacent facilities that blended real estate, institutional medicine and franchising – transforming eldercare into a standardized, corporate system tied to federal policy and funding. Granger’s research reveals how architecture was central to this shift, not just housing older adults but creating an entire system of care. By examining the physical and institutional design of Americana’s homes, she uncovers how midcentury ideals around aging, medicine and profit became embedded in the built environment – a legacy that continues to define long-term care today. In postwar America, as suburbs spread and federal social welfare programs expanded, one underexamined building type quietly became a fixture of the American health care landscape: the nursing home. In a new article published in the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, historian Willa Granger, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the School of Architecture within Florida Atlantic University’s Dorothy F. Schmidt College of Arts and Letters, examines how a little-known company from midcentury Illinois helped lay the groundwork for the modern nursing home industry in the United States. Granger’s research centers on the Americana Corporation, a for-profit eldercare chain that pioneered a replicable model of suburban, hospital-adjacent nursing homes during the 1960s – ultimately reshaping not only how older adults are cared for, but where and by whom. Through meticulous archival research, Granger draws from internal business records, marketing materials, and federal policy documents to show how nursing homes evolved from small, local operations – often run out of converted houses – into standardized, medically regulated institutions tied to federal funding and corporate expansion. Granger’s article is one of the first comprehensive architectural histories of the nursing home in the U.S. By placing this overlooked building type at the center of debates about health care, policy and design, she opens new questions about how architecture has participated in shaping social institutions – not only reflecting cultural attitudes toward aging but actively producing them. “This is not just a story about nursing homes. It is a story about how buildings mediate care, how federal policy influences physical space, and how the structure of eldercare became a mirror of midcentury American life – its promises, its anxieties and its enduring contradictions,” said Granger. Americana wasn’t just building nursing homes. It was building a system – one that merged health care with real estate, design and franchising. In doing so, it helped redefine what eldercare looked like, both physically and institutionally. Founded in 1960, Americana was conceived to bridge the growing gap “between hospital and the private home,” according to its early marketing materials. Americana’s facilities were strategically sited near regional hospitals in growing suburban and rural markets. Its facilities were purpose-built, single-story structures styled in familiar neocolonial architecture – with brick facades, white porticos and decorative shutters – but internally organized according to clinical, hospital-style layouts. Americana’s leaders borrowed tactics from the booming motel industry, blending real estate development, standardization and institutional medicine to build nursing homes across the Midwest that felt like home but functioned like hospitals. By 1969, the company had developed more than 30 locations across nine states. Its success was driven not only by design and branding, but by a unique moment in U.S. policy. Granger’s article demonstrates how federal programs like the Hill-Burton Act, Social Security, and especially Medicare, helped incentivize and normalize this new model of care. The very programs meant to support aging Americans also helped consolidate eldercare into a professionalized, increasingly privatized industry. “Americana shows how architecture was used not just to house people, but to create an entire system of care – one shaped by regulation, profit and a vision of aging that was both medicalized and marketable,” said Granger. Granger’s study raises urgent questions about the legacy of this shift and its continued relevance today. “As the U.S. faces a rapidly aging population and mounting pressures on long-term care, the origins of the modern nursing home reveal how deeply our built environments reflect the values – and blind spots – of their time,” said Granger. “History reminds us that decisions about architecture, policy and profit are never neutral; they shape the everyday lives of vulnerable people. Understanding where these systems came from is essential if we hope to imagine and build something better.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",

    "headline": "Where a Child Lives - Not Just Diet - Raises Type 2 Diabetes Risk",
    "content": "Findings reveal strong links between type 2 diabetes risk and environmental factors like walkability, litter, and access to processed foods. Children in food-insecure homes or areas with limited green space showed higher risk indicators. Study Snapshot: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rising sharply among children, now accounting for up to 45% of youth diabetes cases – compared to just 1% to 2% before the mid-1990s. While obesity remains the strongest risk factor, a new study highlights how early-life environments also shape T2D risk. Researchers analyzed data from 174,000 children nationwide, including nearly 50,000 under age 5, and found that neighborhood conditions, caregiver health, food insecurity, and use of assistance programs significantly influenced diabetes outcomes. Although T2D remains rare in very young children, the study found strong links between risk and environmental factors like neighborhood walkability, litter, and access to processed foods through assistance programs. For example, children in food-insecure homes or urban areas with fewer green spaces had higher risk indicators. The findings suggest that effective prevention must go beyond individual habits, focusing instead on improving nutrition quality, reducing sugary drink intake, and creating healthier, more active environments for young children. Type 2 diabetes (T2D), once considered an adult-onset disease, is increasing at alarming rates in children and adolescents. Before the mid-1990s, just 1% to 2% of youth with diabetes had T2D. Today, that number has skyrocketed to between 24% and 45%, with the average age of diagnosis hovering around 13 years old. This troubling trend closely tracks with the ongoing rise in childhood obesity. While genetics, diet and physical activity all play roles in T2D risk, new research from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine highlights another key factor in T2D risk: where a child lives. Researchers conducted a large-scale study to explore how T2D is emerging in the youngest children. Using data from the National Survey of Children’s Health spanning 2016 to 2020, the team focused on a subgroup of children from birth to age 5 – a rarely studied demographic in T2D research. The study analyzed responses from caregivers of more than 174,000 children nationwide, including nearly 50,000 in the early childhood group. Researchers examined not only diet and physical activity but also broader influences like neighborhood conditions, caregiver health, food security, and participation in government assistance programs. Their goal: to better understand how early life experiences and environments might shape the risk of developing T2D. The results, published in the journal Pediatric Research, found that while the overall prevalence of T2D in children under age 5 remained low and relatively stable over the five-year period, the disease’s development appears to be tied more to social and environmental factors than to individual behaviors alone. Certain neighborhood and household characteristics stood out. For example, in both 2016 and 2020, having a library nearby was significantly associated with childhood T2D diagnoses. This association is thought to reflect broader neighborhood and behavioral patterns that encourage sedentary, indoor activities rather than outdoor physical engagement. Libraries tend to reflect more urban environments compared to areas with high neighborhood walkability and green space. “Research has shown that neighborhood environments – such as the presence of sidewalks, parks or other green spaces – can directly influence a child’s ability to engage in physical activity, and in turn, affect their risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes,” said Lea Sacca, Ph.D., senior author and an assistant professor of population health in the Schmidt College of Medicine. Caregivers also increasingly reported neighborhood issues like litter and vandalism. These environmental concerns grew steadily between 2016 and 2020 and were evident across both the overall sample and the youngest age group. Other notable associations emerged in early childhood include receiving help from neighbors in 2016 and neighborhood walkability in 2019. Study findings also showed that in 2017, access to free or reduced-cost meals showed a similar link to neighborhood and household characteristics. From 2019 to 2020, there was a marked increase in the use of government assistance programs such as food stamps, free meal plans and cash support. While these programs may help address food insecurity, their impact on nutrition quality is more complicated. Participation in programs like SNAP and school meals has been linked to increased intake of processed, energy-dense foods high in sugar and fat, which may contribute to the risk of T2D. “While this finding could suggest improved access to food, previous research shows that relying on food assistance doesn’t always equate to better nutrition,” said Sacca. “For instance, children in food-insecure households tend to have poorer blood sugar control and higher hospitalization rates. Some research even suggests that participants in programs like SNAP may have worse diet quality than non-participants from similarly low-income households.” The researchers say effective T2D prevention and early detection efforts must consider both environmental factors and food quality – particularly neighborhood design and access to nutritious options – for lasting and widespread impact. Nonetheless, obesity remains the strongest and most common risk factor for TD2 in children. Children who are significantly overweight are four times more likely to develop the disease by age 25 than those with a healthy weight. “With obesity rates continuing to rise, especially among young children, prevention efforts are critical,” said Sacca. One particularly urgent target is reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, which are closely linked to both obesity and diabetes risk. Notably, nearly 70% of children aged 2 to 5 consume sugar-sweetened beverages daily. While some school-based policies like vending machine restrictions and small beverage taxes have led to slight decreases in consumption on school grounds, overall intake remains high. The researchers suggest that more assertive policies, including full bans in schools and larger taxes, may be needed. At the same time, evidence from successful school-based programs shows that improving dietary habits and increasing physical activity among children is achievable with the right support. “The rise in early-onset type 2 diabetes is a growing public health concern,” said Sacca. “Addressing it requires a comprehensive strategy. That includes improving access to nutritious foods, creating healthier neighborhood environments, and investing in policies that promote long-term wellness from the very start of life.” Study co-authors are FAU medical students Ayden Dunn, Paige Brinzo, Sahar Kaleem, Austin Lent, Madison Etzel, Jennifer Mendonca, Vama Jhumkhawala and Milad Khoury, M.D., a clinical affiliate assistant professor of endocrinology in FAU’s Department of Medicine.

    "content": "Megan Davis, Ph.D., (left) and Becky Holt, assistant director of the Queen Conch Lab, receiving the award during the Responsible Seafood Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia. Award Snapshot: FAU Harbor Branch researchers have received the prestigious 2025 Responsible Seafood Innovation Award in Aquaculture from the Global Seafood Alliance for its Queen Conch Lab’s pioneering work in sustainable aquaculture. Led by Megan Davis, Ph.D., the research team has developed mobile lab hatcheries – trailer-based systems that support queen conch restoration in Caribbean communities lacking traditional infrastructure. These mobile hatcheries help rebuild wild conch populations while creating local opportunities in education, employment, and food security. FAU was recognized for its innovative, community-focused approach, which blends science, sustainability, and cultural preservation to address the urgent decline of a species vital to the region’s ecosystems and economies. The Florida Atlantic University Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute’s Queen Conch Lab, led by research professor Megan Davis, Ph.D., has been named the recipient of the 2025 Responsible Seafood Innovation Award in Aquaculture from the Global Seafood Alliance (GSA). The award honors the Queen Conch Lab’s development of mobile lab hatcheries designed to help restore the threatened Caribbean queen conch. These self-contained, trailer-based hatcheries bring advanced aquaculture capabilities to coastal communities across the Caribbean, many of which lack traditional infrastructure. This innovation is not only helping to rebuild wild conch populations but is also generating opportunities in education, employment and food security throughout the region. GSA is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing responsible seafood practices through education, advocacy and third-party certification. GSA works across the seafood supply chain – from aquaculture to wild fisheries – to promote environmental responsibility, social accountability, food safety and animal welfare. Through its standards, events and media platforms, the organization helps ensure that seafood is produced in ways that are sustainable and ethically managed. This prestigious award was recently presented to Davis and Becky Holt, assistant director of the Queen Conch Lab, during the Responsible Seafood Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia, and recognizes transformative efforts in sustainable aquaculture that contribute to the future of responsible seafood production globally. The queen conch is a culturally and economically vital species that has long sustained Caribbean communities through its role in nutrition, trade and tradition. However, due to decades of overfishing and habitat loss, the species has seen significant declines. In 2024, NOAA listed the queen conch as ‘threatened’ under the Endangered Species Act. Current data suggests that commercial fishing in The Bahamas could become unsustainable within the next 10 to 15 years. Recognizing the urgency of this crisis, FAU’s Queen Conch Lab set out to pioneer a scalable, science-based solution that integrates restoration, education and community engagement. At the heart of this solution is the mobile lab hatchery – a laboratory built inside a custom trailer, similar in size to a food truck, outfitted with advanced aquaculture systems including solar power, aeration, flow-through and recirculating saltwater systems, and algae and conch cultivation setups. These units are designed to be transported to remote areas and connected directly to local seawater sources, making them fully operational hatcheries that require no permanent facilities. Since the first trailer was deployed to Great Exuma, The Bahamas in 2022, eight additional hatcheries have been launched in Puerto Rico, Jamaica, The Bahamas and Florida, with more in development for deployment to other nations including Turks and Caicos and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. These mobile hatcheries are capable of producing up to 2,000 juvenile queen conch annually, supporting both ecosystem restoration and sustainable seafood initiatives. However, their impact goes far beyond biological output. Each hatchery becomes a local hub for science education, job training and community empowerment. Through close partnerships with local organizations such as Blue Action Lab in Grand Bahama, Conservación ConCiencia and Villa Pesquera de Naguabo in Puerto Rico, University of West Indies in Jamaica, and other grassroots conservation and fishing groups – the Queen Conch Lab model ensures that local expertise and cultural knowledge are integrated into every stage of the process. “This recognition from the Global Seafood Alliance is an incredible milestone for our team and our many community partners,” said Davis. “It reflects the idea that science can be mobile, accessible and rooted in local collaboration. What started as a simple concept – putting a hatchery in a trailer – has become a powerful tool for helping to restore queen conch and supporting the culture, food security, seagrass ecosystems and identity of Caribbean communities.” The GSA’s Responsible Seafood Innovation Award highlights innovations that not only address pressing environmental challenges but also serve as catalysts for broader change in how seafood is produced, consumed and valued. “The work coming out of our Queen Conch Lab is extraordinary – not just in its scientific merit, but in its human impact,” said James Sullivan, Ph.D., executive director of FAU Harbor Branch. “The mobile hatcheries represent a new paradigm in aquaculture – bringing the lab to the people, training the next generation of marine scientists, and building resilience in ecosystems and economies alike. This is exactly the kind of bold, collaborative and community-driven work that sustainable seafood needs right now. It’s setting a global standard for what responsible aquaculture can and should look like.” Looking ahead, the Queen Conch Lab continues to pursue its long-term goal of establishing a community-based queen conch farm in every Caribbean country. The lab is also expanding its training programs, educational outreach, and scientific research in collaboration with a growing network of local and international partners. “As Caribbean nations confront the dual challenges of environmental degradation and economic vulnerability, our Queen Conch Lab offers a hopeful, actionable model for restoration and resilience,” said Davis.

    "headline": "After Cancer: Study Explores Caring-Healing Modalities for Survivors",
    "content": "Healing doesn’t end with treatment. As cancer survivorship grows, many continue to struggle with anxiety and depression – often in silence. Study Snapshot: Healing doesn’t end with treatment. As cancer survivorship rates continue to rise, about 30% of people living with or beyond cancer experience lasting emotional challenges such as anxiety and depression. New research underscores the importance of supporting the emotional and psychological well-being of cancer survivors – not just their physical health. Researchers from the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing conducted the first-ever scoping review focused on caring-healing modalities (CHMs), including mindfulness, peer support, and expressive therapies, which help reduce emotional distress and strengthen resilience. The review examined 16 global studies and found that CHMs – delivered in settings from hospitals to homes – created healing environments that nurtured emotional expression, empathy, and human connection. Group-based interventions, in particular, were powerful in helping survivors process fear, rebuild inner strength, and reduce feelings of isolation. While most studies focused on breast cancer, researchers emphasize the need to expand this work across other cancer types. Ultimately, the findings call for a more holistic approach to survivorship care – one that treats patients as whole people and integrates science with compassion. As cancer survivorship rises, many people living with or beyond cancer face lasting physical and emotional challenges – particularly anxiety and depression, which affect about 30% of this population. Emotional distress is often unspoken, leading to fear, despair, and diminished quality of life. Growing research highlights resilience – the ability to recover from adversity – is a key factor in helping individuals manage distress and improve well-being. This underscores the urgent need for health care providers to adopt a whole-person approach that supports not just the body, but also the emotional and psychological needs of people with cancer. As Breast Cancer Awareness Month highlights the importance of survivorship, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing have completed the first scoping review focused on caring-healing modalities (CHMs) designed to boost resilience and reduce emotional distress such as depression and anxiety in people with cancer. Results, published in the journal Nursing Reports, help to shift attention from treatment to healing by exploring how CHMs such as mindfulness, peer support and expressive therapies can reduce emotional distress and build resilience in people with cancer. Notably, the majority of the included studies in this review focused on breast cancer survivors, highlighting the pressing need to address their emotional and spiritual well-being long after treatment ends. “Our findings highlight something too often overlooked in survivorship care: healing doesn’t end when treatment does,” said Judyta Kociolek, corresponding author and director of the FAU Clinical Research Unit, and an oncology nurse prior to starting a career in research. “What patients often need most is to be seen, heard and treated as whole human beings, so they can feel empowered in their recovery and cancer journey. These caring-based practices help them reclaim that sense of self.” Driven by Watson’s Theory of Human Caring, the review analyzed 16 global studies – including randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews – on CHMs delivered in hospitals, outpatient clinics and at home. The interventions varied widely, from mindfulness-based programs and therapeutic group discussions to expressive writing and psychoeducation. What these diverse approaches had in common were deeply human elements: shared emotional expression, empathetic listening, and a healing environment. CHMs created safe, quiet spaces where individuals could process fear, grief, hope and transformation – together or on their own. “This kind of healing environment isn’t just about peace and quiet – it’s a form of caring in action,” said Rita Gengo, Ph.D., co-author and an assistant professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “When you reduce noise, create privacy and invite calm, you allow people to breathe, reflect and begin to mend emotionally. The setting itself becomes part of the therapy.” The review found that group-based interventions were especially powerful. Whether in person or online, these sessions created supportive spaces where survivors could share their stories, reduce feelings of isolation, and discover inner strength. Many CHMs reflected principles similar to those in Watson’s Caritas Processes – such as authentic presence, building trust, and fostering care-centered teaching – a connection noted by the researchers. Watson’s Caritas Processes are a set of guiding principles in nursing that emphasize caring for the whole person – mind, body and spirit. They focus on compassion, deep human connection, and treating patients with dignity, empathy and respect. These processes encourage nurses to be fully present, build trusting relationships, and support healing beyond just physical care. “Caring-healing modalities grounded in human connection offer something profoundly transformative,” said Lenny Chiang-Hanisko, Ph.D., co-author and an associate professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “Through caring partnerships, people can access a deeper sense of self, expand their emotional capacity, and awaken their innate ability to heal.” Several studies in the review incorporated mindfulness-based techniques such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Mindful Self-Compassion, and Attention and Interpretation Therapy, which encouraged individuals to be present, breathe, and acknowledge both positive and negative emotions without judgment. These programs helped participants cultivate resilience and self-compassion, while also reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Importantly, CHMs were delivered in a variety of formats – face-to-face, online or through a hybrid approach – making them accessible and adaptable across different care settings. Some were brief, lasting 20 to 30 minutes, while others extended over months, allowing for deeper transformation. The review found that both short and long-term CHMs had clinical value, with longer programs more closely aligned with Watson’s emphasis on sustained caring-healing relationships. While the review focused primarily on resilience and emotional distress, many studies also reported improvements in quality of life, self-compassion, physical symptoms like fatigue, insomnia and pain, and even biomarkers related to stress. By integrating subjective experiences with objective data, CHMs pave the way toward precision nursing that honors both science and soul. “By bringing together personal experience and biological insight, we’re creating a future where care is deeply individualized,” said Kociolek. “It’s a vision of nursing that’s both scientifically rigorous and profoundly human.” This review also identifies important gaps and opportunities. Research on CHMs is still limited for other cancers, such as prostate or colorectal cancer, and funding for complementary therapies remains a barrier. The researchers call for expanded testing, greater reimbursement, and the inclusion of CHMs in standard survivorship care.

    "headline": "FAU Researchers 'Zoom' in for an Ultra-Magnified Peek at Shark Skin",
    "content": "A bonnethead shark – the pint-sized cousin of hammerhead sharks. STUDY SNAPSHOT: What gives shark skin its unique toughness and smooth, hydrodynamic edge? The secret lies in dermal denticles – tiny, tooth-like scales made of the same material as our teeth. These microscopic armor plates don’t just make sharks sleek swimmers; they also shield their bodies from damage. But how do these denticles change as sharks grow – and do male and female sharks have different designs? Researchers dove deep into these questions by studying bonnethead sharks, close relatives of hammerheads. Using electron microscopy, they captured incredibly detailed images of the sharks’ skin, analyzing how denticle shape, size, and texture evolve across different life stages. Their findings revealed that as sharks mature, their denticles develop more ridges and change in orientation – enhancements that likely improve swimming efficiency and protection. Interestingly, while researchers expected major differences between the sexes, they found only one: males had slightly steeper ridge angles. This research not only sheds light on how sharks are built for survival and reproduction but could also inspire future innovations in swimwear and biomimetic design. Have you ever wondered what makes shark skin so tough and sleek? It’s dermal denticles – tiny, tooth-like structures that cover a shark’s skin. Made of the same material as teeth and shaped like small scales with grooves, these microscopic armor plates aren’t just for show. Dermal denticles serve important roles in helping sharks glide effortlessly, and protect their skin, especially during mating. Although much is known, researchers still lack a full understanding of how dermal denticle shape changes across different parts of the shark’s body as it grows and if there are differences between males and females. To solve this mystery, researchers from Florida Atlantic University turned to high-resolution imaging to examine bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) – the pint-sized cousins of hammerhead sharks. Using advanced scanning electron microscopy, they were able to capture detailed images of the sharks’ skin, focusing on minute features like denticle shape, size and ridge patterns – details far too small to be seen with standard microscopes. The team studied skin samples from 24 bonnethead sharks across various life stages. These sharks were an ideal subject, as their skin denticles undergo noticeable changes as they grow and show distinct features between males and females, especially in areas linked to mating. Findings, published in the journal Integrative and Comparative Biology, provide an ultra-magnified peek into the hidden world of shark skin, revealing how evolution fine-tunes this natural armor for survival and reproduction. Results of the study showed that denticle morphology changes significantly as bonnethead sharks mature, supporting the idea that these changes improve swimming efficiency and skin protection. Younger sharks had fewer ridges on the denticles, less overlap between them, and smaller ridge angles compared to older sharks. However, the overall length of the denticles stayed about the same at all stages. These changes likely help sharks swim better and protect their skin as they mature. “Shark skin is far more dynamic than people realize,” said Marianne E. Porter, Ph.D., senior author and an associate professor of biological sciences in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Our study shows that as bonnethead sharks grow, their skin doesn’t just get bigger – it transforms in ways that improve swimming performance and provide greater protection. These changes help reduce drag in the water and strengthen the skin against physical challenges like predators or mating-related injuries. It’s a remarkable example of how nature fine-tunes biological structures to meet the changing demands of an animal’s life.” Although previous studies found that female sharks often have thicker, tougher skin with higher denticle density – possibly to protect against male bites during mating – this study found minimal differences between the sexes. The only denticle trait that showed sexual dimorphism was ridge angle, which was slightly larger in males. There were also no significant differences in denticle features across the dorsal, medial and ventral parts of the abdominal region studied. “This research is relevant because gaining an understanding of the developmental aspects of a shark’s dermal denticles can provide extraordinary insights into their evolutionary role in facilitating survival locomotion and reproductive materials,” said Hannah Epstein, corresponding author, a recent graduate of FAU High School and a current student in FAU’s Harriet L. Wilkes Honors College. “We can also apply these quantifications of shark skin to other fields, such as bioengineering, to specifically design materials that can help someone swim faster, just as denticles help a shark swim faster.” The patterns observed in this study mirrors findings in other species, such as Portuguese dogfish sharks, which have 11 different denticle shapes that appear at different developmental stages. Past research has also shown that juveniles tend to have smaller denticles than adults, a trend that held true for bonnethead sharks in this study. “The advanced imaging and analysis tools we have at the Marcus Research and Innovation Center were essential for this research,” said Tricia Meredith, Ph.D., co-author, director of research for Florida Atlantic Laboratory Schools, and an assistant research professor in FAU’s College of Education. “Using scanning electron microscopy and precise morphometric software allowed us to see and measure the tiny details of shark denticles like never before. This technology opens up new possibilities to understand how these structures function and evolve, giving us a clearer picture of shark biology and biomechanics.” The Berlin Family Bioimaging Lab is a one-of-a-kind research laboratory that provides students access to high-tech equipment to work on complex research projects, including cancer treatment research, vaccine development, and prosthetic creation, among others. Students like Epstein can research some of the world’s most challenging problems at an early age and can share that research and publish it in peer-reviewed journals. The lab includes a micro computed tomography scanner; scanning electron microscope; histology suite; inverted compound microscope; and stereoscope and is available to researchers of all levels at FAU. Study co-author is Madeleine E. Hagood, a Ph.D. student of integrative biology at FAU. The research was supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER Award grant, awarded to Porter, and an FAU Office of Undergraduate Research and Inquiry grant awarded to Epstein.
