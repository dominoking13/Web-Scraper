    "content": "A new study of 2,000 U.S. adults shows dark web users report much higher rates of depression, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, self-injury and digital self-harm than surface web users. Study Snapshot: A new Florida Atlantic University study reveals that dark web users show significantly higher levels of depression, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, self-injury, and digital self-harm compared to surface web users. Using survey data from 2,000 U.S. adults, researchers found that people with suicidal thoughts were nearly three times more likely to use the dark web, while those engaging in self-injury or digital self-harm were up to five and 19 times more likely, respectively. The findings suggest that dark web use may be driven in part by mental health struggles rather than just privacy concerns. Researchers encourage mental health professionals and policymakers to recognize these hidden online spaces as important areas for outreach, as many vulnerable individuals may turn to the dark web seeking anonymity, information and a sense of community. The dark web – a hidden corner of the internet accessed through privacy-preserving tools like the Tor browser – operates beyond the reach of traditional search engines and public platforms. Unlike the surface web, its architecture is deliberately designed to shield identities and activities from view, prioritizing anonymity over transparency. Although the dark web has existed for more than 20 years, research assessing mental health differences between its users and those who stay on the surface web remains limited. Its pseudo-anonymous nature and emphasis on privacy may attract individuals with mental health vulnerabilities, potentially drawing them into these hidden spaces. A small but growing body of research points to a possible connection between mental health challenges and dark web use. However, direct empirical comparisons between dark web users and surface web users – especially in the context of mental health – are scarce. While such links have been theorized, they have yet to be thoroughly investigated through systematic research, until now. A new Florida Atlantic University study reveals significant mental health differences between dark web users and those who use only the surface web, and sheds light on a group whose involvement in this secretive online space has largely kept them outside the scope of traditional research. Leveraging survey data collected from 2,000 adults in the United States, Ryan C. Meldrum, Ph.D., lead author and director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice within FAU’s College of Social Work and Criminal Justice, and collaborators, explored whether those who report dark web use differ from surface web users across five mental health indicators. Published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking, the study finds that dark web users reported substantially higher levels of depressive symptoms and paranoid thoughts as compared to surface web users. In addition, there were substantial differences between dark web users and surface web users pertaining to suicidal thoughts, non-suicidal self-injury and digital self-harm. Adults who reported suicidal thoughts had nearly three times greater odds of reporting dark web use. Likewise, those who reported non-suicidal self-injury (e.g. cutting or burning oneself) were nearly five times more likely to report use of the dark web, and individuals who had engaged in digital self-harm (anonymously posting hurtful or negative comments about themselves online) had more than 19 times greater odds of reported dark web use. “Our findings suggest that many individuals who turn to the dark web may be doing so not just for privacy concerns, but as a reflection of deeper mental health struggles and the possible desire to socialize and engage in information-seeking in a context free of scrutiny that might otherwise be experienced on the surface web or offline,” said Meldrum. “This underscores the need for mental health professionals to recognize and understand the hidden digital spaces some individuals may be engaging with. The dark web isn’t just a technological frontier – it’s a human one, where vulnerability and pain often go unseen.” The discovery that dark web users consistently report greater mental health vulnerabilities carries significant real-world implications. Equipping social workers and mental health practitioners to safely and ethically engage with individuals on the dark web could open new pathways to support those who may otherwise go unnoticed. Similarly, raising awareness among parents, educators and policymakers about the link between mental health and dark web use – just as has been done with problematic social media use – could be a valuable step forward. “The dark web may seem like a world apart, but the psychological challenges many people bring into this space are very real,” said Meldrum. “We cannot afford to overlook these digital environments simply because they are used by a subset of internet users. If we are committed to reaching the most vulnerable, we must be willing to engage with them – even in the more hidden corners of the internet.” Study co-authors are Raymond D.

    "headline": "Hurricane Season Ends, But Weather Woes Push Floridians to Move",
    "content": "Survey Snapshot: A new Florida Atlantic University survey finds that 36% of Floridians have moved or are considering moving due to hazards such as hurricanes, flooding and extreme heat. Nearly a quarter of North Floridians say weather hazards have influenced their past moves and about 20% of respondents in the rest of the peninsula south say they are considering a move at least in part due to weather hazards. The survey also shows significant climate concerns: more than 60% are concerned about stronger storms and flooding, and nearly half are concerned about homeowner’s insurance costs. While 85% believe climate change is happening, just more than half say human activity is responsible, with views varying by political affiliation. Most respondents want more government action on climate risks. Although the Atlantic hurricane season has officially ended, Floridians’ woes over severe weather and soaring homeowners’ insurance costs still linger. A new Florida Atlantic University survey finds hurricanes and other climate-related threats are causing many Floridians to consider moving. The Florida Climate Survey found that 36% of respondents statewide had moved or were considering moving in part or fully due to weather hazards. Broken down by region, the results show that threats such as hurricanes, flooding and extreme heat have already influenced some Floridians to relocate. Nearly a quarter of North Floridians (24%) reported that these factors contributed to a previous decision to move within the state. Across much of the peninsula, from Tampa to Cape Canaveral south, about 20% of respondents report that weather hazards play a role in them exploring a move. “About 1 in 5 Floridians from about the I-4 corridor to Key West are considering a move due to weather hazards,” said Colin Polsky, Ph.D., associate vice president of Broward campuses for FAU and a professor of geosciences in the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science. “Some of these people may wish to move but cannot afford the expenses. This shows a possibly large number of residents struggling with weather hazards.” The survey is the 13th conducted by the FAU Center for Environmental Studies on Floridians’ opinions about climate resilience issues since October 2019. The latest survey was conducted in late September — about one year after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida, a storm that was followed about two weeks later by Hurricane Milton and a related tornado outbreak. Underpinning the interest in moving are concerns about weather hazards. More than 60% of Floridians are moderately or extremely concerned about hurricanes becoming stronger and/or more frequent (63%), and about rainfall becoming heavier in the state and higher flooding from storm surge near the coast (61% in both cases). “Despite a major shift in the national weather and climate conversation in 2025, people’s lived experiences in Florida appear to have kept these hazards top of mind, influencing where people think it is safe to live,” Polsky said. While the survey found that an overwhelming majority of Floridians believe climate change is happening (85%), the level was the lowest in the survey’s six-year history. Just more than half of Floridians believe climate change is caused by human activity (52%), the latest results found. Breaking down that finding by political party, 71% of Democrats, 50% of Independents and 39% of Republicans said they believe human actions are causing climate change. Nearly half of Floridians (49%) report concern about the affordability of homeowner’s insurance due to climate change. The survey also found that more than 60% of Floridians want the federal or state government to do more to address the impacts of climate change, but the finding was the lowest level since questions about climate action were added in March 2023. “While public support for climate action may swing wildly from one presidential election to another, a substantial share of Floridians face an abiding weather risk,” Polsky said. The survey was conducted in English and Spanish from Sept. 24 to 30. The sample consisted of 1,400 Floridians aged 18 and older, with a survey margin of error of +/- 2.53%. The data were collected using an online panel provided by GreatBlue Research. Responses were weighted to adjust for age, income, education, gender and region, according to the 2023 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. It is important to remember that subsets carry higher margins of error.

    "headline": "FAU Innovation for Next-Generation AI Factories Featured by NVIDIA",
    "content": "Arslan Munir, Ph.D., co-author and associate professor in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. (Photo credit: New York University, Abu Dhabi) Research Snapshot: As artificial intelligence data centers expand in size and power demand, traditional air-cooling systems are struggling to keep high-density GPU clusters cool and efficient. Rising temperatures limit performance, increase energy use, and increase operating costs – creating a major barrier to scaling the next generation of AI infrastructure. Research from the College of Engineering and Computer Science, highlighted by NVIDIA, shows that direct-to-chip liquid cooling solves these bottlenecks by keeping GPUs significantly cooler while using less power. The result is up to 17% higher performance, lower energy consumption, and millions in potential annual savings – offering a practical, sustainable path for building more efficient AI factories. The research, now featured on NVIDIA’s website, demonstrates that direct-to-chip liquid-cooled GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) systems deliver up to 17% higher computational throughput while reducing node-level power consumption by 16% compared to traditional air-cooled systems. These results translate to potential annual facility-scale savings of $2.25 million to $11.8 million for AI data centers operating between 2,000 to 5,000 GPU nodes. The study titled, “Comparison of Air-Cooled Versus Liquid-Cooled NVIDIA GPU Systems,” was co-authored by Arslan Munir, Ph.D., associate professor in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, alongside collaborators from Johnson Controls and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and was conducted using NVIDIA HGX™ H100 GPU systems. “Our research shows that liquid cooling fundamentally unlocks higher sustained performance, superior energy efficiency, and the thermal headroom needed to push AI workloads to their full potential,” said Munir. “These results provide the technical foundation for designing AI factories capable of handling extreme rack densities while maintaining optimal performance, sustainability and cost efficiency.” The findings from this research arrive at a pivotal time. According to recent federal and industry reports, U.S. investment in AI and data-center infrastructure is expected to exceed $400 billion over the next several years, as the government and private sector build out new AI-training campuses and cloud facilities nationwide. These AI factories are the backbone of modern innovation, powering breakthroughs in health care, national security, transportation and climate research. However, they also consume vast amounts of energy. “By directly confronting the thermal and power-efficiency bottlenecks that define today’s large-scale GPU clusters, this research is charting a clear path toward truly sustainable, high-performance computing,” said Stella Batalma, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “This work demonstrates how innovative cooling technologies can lower operational costs, reduce environmental impact, and significantly increase compute density within existing data-center footprints – advancing both the science and the scalability of AI.” Key findings from the FAU-led study reveal: The work underscores FAU’s growing leadership in intelligent systems, data-center innovation, and quantum- and AI-driven computing. Munir’s Intelligent Systems, Computer Architecture, Analytics and Security Laboratory in the College of Engineering and Computer Science is pioneering research that intersects AI hardware acceleration, hybrid quantum-classical computing, and sustainable HPC system design. “Energy-efficient AI infrastructure isn’t just an engineering optimization – it’s a national imperative,” said Munir. “By rethinking how we cool and power AI factories, we can dramatically increase performance while aligning with global sustainability and cost-reduction goals.” Collaborators on the white paper include Imran Latif, vice president of global technology and innovation for data centers at Johnson Controls; Alex Newkirk, energy technology researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; FAU doctoral researcher Hayat Ullah; and Kansas State University doctoral researcher Ali Shafique, both supervised by Munir.

    "headline": "Muscle Protein Linked to Exercise Opens New Way to Treat Alzheimer's",
    "content": "Findings of the study reveal that the key to fighting Alzheimer's disease may lie not just in the brain – but also in our muscles. Study Snapshot: A pioneering study reveals a promising new approach to combating Alzheimer’s disease (AD): targeting muscle health. While AD is typically associated with the brain, this research shows that skeletal muscle plays a critical role in protecting cognitive function. Central to the discovery is Cathepsin B (Ctsb), a protein released by muscles during exercise. Researchers found that expressing Ctsb in the muscles of AD-model mice improved memory and motor function, even though classic signs of the disease such as brain plaques remained. Muscle Ctsb treatment rescues hippocampal brain cell growth and restores important protein balances. This suggests that targeting muscle health – through exercise, gene therapy or drugs – could be a new way to fight cognitive decline. While more research is needed, especially in humans, the study highlights the potentially powerful connection between muscle and brain in neurodegenerative diseases. Growing evidence links skeletal muscle function to cognitive health. Pioneering research from Florida Atlantic University and its collaborators at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research takes this evidence to the next level, revealing that the key to fighting AD may lie not just in the brain – but also in our muscles. At the center of this discovery is Cathepsin B (Ctsb), a protein long studied in cancer and brain injury, but that also functions as a myokine – a molecule released by muscles during exercise, which can influence memory function. The new study, published in the journal Aging Cell, investigated whether a gene therapy approach to specifically express Ctsb in muscle could protect brain function in an AD mouse model. In this approach, the mice were given a viral vector – a harmless, engineered virus containing the Ctsb gene that enters the muscle cell, where it expresses Ctsb in the tissue. These mice carry human genetic mutations that mimic the key symptoms of the condition, including memory loss and amyloid pathology. The findings were striking. Mice treated with Ctsb in their muscles did not develop the typical memory deficits associated with AD. Moreover, the new neuron growth in the hippocampus, a brain region essential for learning and memory, was preserved. In fact, their brain, muscle and blood protein profiles more closely resembled those of healthy mice. This suggests that increasing Ctsb in muscle tissue may offer protection against the effects of AD. “Our study is the first to show that expressing Cathepsin B specifically in muscle can prevent memory loss and maintain brain function in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Henriette van Praag, Ph.D., corresponding author and an associate professor of biomedical science in the FAU Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute (SNBI). “Our findings suggest that modulating muscle Ctsb through gene therapy, and perhaps even drugs or exercise – could slow down or reverse memory decline by promoting brain cell growth, restoring protein balance and rebalancing brain activity.” Interestingly, the treatment did not reduce the hallmark AD features, such as inflammation or plaques, which are generally considered the main therapeutic targets. Despite these persistent signs of disease, brain function improved, indicating that Ctsb may support memory and cognition through as of yet sparsely explored pathways – possibly by restoring the brain’s ability to produce proteins essential for adult neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. “We’ve long known that physical activity benefits the brain, but this study brings us closer to understanding how that happens at a molecular level,” said Atul S. Deshmukh, Ph.D., co-corresponding author and an associate professor at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen. “Muscle isn’t just a mechanical tissue – it’s a powerful communicator with the brain. This opens exciting possibilities for new treatments that harness the body’s own biology to fight neurodegeneration.” The effects, however, were not the same in healthy mice. When Ctsb was given to mice without AD it appeared to harm their memory, potentially due to differential processing of the gene therapy vector in healthy versus AD mouse muscle. Although more research is needed, especially in humans, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that the muscles and brain are deeply connected – and that improving muscle health could offer new ways to treat or even prevent neurodegenerative diseases. “While there’s still much to learn, our work reinforces a powerful idea: the path to protecting the brain may start in the body,” said van Praag. “Targeting muscle may have the potential to become a novel, low cost, non-invasive therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative disease that would be accessible to many patients.” Study co-authors include first authors Alejando Pinto, SNBI; Hazal Haytural, Ph.D., University of Copenhagen; and Cassio Morais Loss, Ph.D., SNBI. Other co-authors represent the Schmidt College of Medicine; Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, SNBI, University of Copenhagen, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Université Côte d’Azur & Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique, Valbonne, France. “These studies represent a significant step in understanding mechanisms by which exercise, and specifically muscle-derived molecules, can support brain health,” said Randy Blakely, Ph.D., executive director of the SNBI, the David J.S. Nicholson Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience, and a professor of biomedical science in the Schmidt College of Medicine. “By showing that signals from our muscles can profoundly influence memory and cognition, the work adds significantly to our appreciation of the complex links between body and brain. The work is striking not only in its relevance for new medications to treat Alzheimer’s disease, but also as a cogent example of how biological factors derived from healthy lifestyle opportunities can be identified and may support resilience to the challenges of aging.” The work was supported by grants from the Novo Nordisk Foundation to Deshmukh, the National Institutes of Health awarded to co-author Tal Kafri, M.D., Ph.D., University of North Carolina School of Medicine; and by the Ed and Ethel Moore Alzheimer’s Disease Research Program of the Florida Department of Health awarded to van Praag.

    "headline": "FAU Engineering Lands NIH Grant to Study How the Brain Learns to 'See'",
    "content": "Luke Rosedahl, Ph.D., principal investigator, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and a Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) fellow. Grant Snapshot: Vision is one of our most fundamental senses, shaping how we perceive and interact with the world. For more than 12 million Americans with visual impairments, even small deficits can limit independence and quality of life. Visual perceptual learning (VPL) – the brain’s ability to improve detection of subtle visual differences – has shown promise in enhancing vision, but its effects are typically confined to the specific area of the visual field that is trained, limiting broader clinical and practical use. A new three-year, $746,998 National Eye Institute grant will support research into how attention mechanisms can help VPL generalize across the visual field. By combining computational modeling, brain imaging and neurochemical analysis, the project will study how visual skills learned in one area can transfer to others. The findings could transform vision rehabilitation, improve training in visually demanding professions, and inspire AI systems that learn and adapt like the human brain. Vision is one of the most fundamental senses, shaping how we perceive, navigate and interact with the world around us. Yet for more than 12 million Americans living with visual impairments, even small deficits can profoundly impact daily life, limiting independence and overall quality of life. Researchers have long recognized the potential of visual perceptual learning (VPL) – a process by which the brain improves its ability to detect subtle differences in visual stimuli, such as fine patterns or orientations – to enhance vision. VPL is already being explored in professional contexts such as radiology, where precise detection of faint anomalies in medical images can save lives. However, a significant challenge remains: improvements in visual perception through VPL are typically confined to the exact part of the visual field that is trained, greatly restricting its broader clinical and practical applications. To address this challenge, Luke Rosedahl, Ph.D., principal investigator, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering within the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, and a Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) fellow, has received a $746,998, three-year grant from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The grant will support his research aimed at uncovering the neural mechanisms that allow VPL to generalize beyond the specific conditions under which it is acquired. Rosedahl’s work focuses on how different forms of attention – such as feature-based attention, which focuses on specific characteristics of visual stimuli, and spatial attention, which directs focus to particular locations in the visual field – interact to enable the transfer of visual learning to untrained areas. “This grant represents an incredible opportunity to advance our understanding of how the brain learns to see and how that learning can be made more adaptable,” said Rosedahl, a member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute. “Our ultimate goal is to understand the mechanisms that allow visual perceptual learning to transfer across the visual field. By identifying how attention contributes to this process, we can develop more effective training paradigms for vision rehabilitation and potentially create artificial intelligence systems that mimic the human brain’s remarkable ability to adapt and learn from visual experience.” Rosedahl’s project will employ a combination of computational modeling, brain imaging, and neurochemical analysis to study how visual information is reorganized during learning. The research will specifically investigate a technique known as “double-training,” in which training on a secondary, seemingly unrelated task at a new visual field location prompts the transfer of previously acquired visual skills to that location. By integrating data from behavioral performance measures, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and changes in neurotransmitter concentrations measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the project aims to develop a unified model of visual processing, VPL and attention. “We expect this model to not only advance fundamental neuroscience but also serve as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community studying visual learning in real-world scenarios,” said Rosedahl. The implications of this research are far-reaching. For individuals with visual impairments, the ability to generalize visual learning across the visual field could dramatically improve the efficiency and effectiveness of rehabilitation programs. For professionals in fields such as radiology, surveillance or any domain that relies on nuanced visual discrimination, these insights could inform advanced training methods that enhance accuracy and performance. Furthermore, the principles uncovered in this research could inspire the design of AI systems that learn and adapt in ways more analogous to the human brain, particularly in tasks requiring sophisticated visual judgment. Rosedahl’s long-term research goal is to understand the interactions between multiple visual processes including category learning, visual perceptual learning, and attention, to optimize both training paradigms and rehabilitation strategies. His work builds on prior findings that VPL is typically highly location-specific, aiming to uncover how combinations of attention mechanisms can overcome this limitation. Over the next three years, Rosedahl and his team will work to decode the neural processes underlying flexible visual learning, paving the way for more effective interventions for individuals with visual impairments and novel approaches to training in professional fields that demand high-level visual expertise. “Professor Rosedahl’s work addresses a fundamental challenge in vision science with enormous real-world impact,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “By uncovering how the brain can generalize visual learning, this research could transform vision rehabilitation and professional training, redefining what is possible for individuals with visual impairments and advancing our understanding of human perception. It also has the potential to inspire innovative approaches to learning and adaptation in both humans and machines.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",

    "headline": "FAU Study: Small Group Counseling Helps Children Thrive at School",
    "content": "FAU College of Education researchers found small group counseling improves sixth graders’ emotional skills, school connectedness, and engagement, supporting social and academic growth. Study Snapshot: Many students experience anxiety, stress or disconnection at school, which can hinder both their academic and social-emotional growth. While school counselors provide support, traditional programs often lack structured, evidence-based approaches to help students manage emotions, build peer relationships, and develop essential skills. FAU College of Education researchers explored the impact of the Student Success Skills small group counseling intervention for sixth graders. Over six sessions, students developed anger management, goal setting, and social problem-solving skills while building trust and community. Results of the study showed greater connectedness, improved perceptions of school climate, and increased engagement, highlighting the effectiveness of Advocating Student-Within-Environment or ASE-based small group counseling in supporting students’ emotional and academic growth. Across the United States, children spend more than 1,100 hours in school each year – time that shapes not only their academic success but also their emotional and social growth. Yet, for many students, the school environment can also be a source of anxiety and apprehension. School counselors play a pivotal role in addressing these challenges through evidence-based, comprehensive guidance programs. Addressing this critical need, researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Department of Counselor Education within the College of Education conducted a qualitative study to explore how participation in the Student Success Skills (SSS) small group counseling intervention influences middle school students’ sense of connectedness to their school environment, guided by the Advocating Student-Within-Environment (ASE) theory. Working with sixth graders in the Southeastern U.S., the research team collected data through pre- and post-intervention interviews, field notes, session transcripts, student-generated drawings and counseling activities. They used thematic analysis to identify key patterns and themes of how the intervention helped students develop anger management, academic and life skills – abilities that, in turn, would strengthen their engagement and perception of school climate. The results of the study, published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Counseling, identified four key outcomes: improved anger management and conflict resolution, the development of academic and life skills, increased feelings of connectedness and safety, and more positive perceptions of the overall school environment. Students learned practical emotional regulation strategies, such as positive self-talk and seeking peer support, and engaged in role-playing exercises to practice conflict resolution and goal setting. As the sessions progressed, students’ drawings and interview responses reflected a noticeable shift – from neutral or negative portrayals of school to images and statements highlighting friendship, belonging and motivation to learn. “As the students became more connected to one another, so did their sense of contribution and compassion, which extended far beyond the school environment,” said Elizabeth Villares Sacks, Ph.D., co-author and chair and professor, FAU Department of Counselor Education. “Small group counseling provided students with far more than strategies for managing emotions and relationships – it offered them a space to feel seen, heard and valued. Through these shared experiences, students began to recognize their own strengths and see themselves not just as learners, but as capable, compassionate contributors within their school communities and beyond.” Findings revealed notable growth in trust and community among group members. Students collaboratively developed confidentiality agreements and group norms, creating a safe space for authentic sharing and peer support. By cultivating social-emotional and academic skills, this approach enhances engagement, connectedness and perceptions of school climate. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness of ASE-based small group counseling in promoting students’ emotional and academic development and suggest the need for further research on its broader systemic impact in schools. “Interventions grounded in ASE not only support students’ emotional growth but transform how they experience their school environments,” Villares Sacks said. “When students feel connected and understood, they become more engaged learners and more compassionate peers.” The study was conducted during the 2023-24 school year and involved five sixth-grade students who were identified as being at academic or behavioral risk. Over six weekly sessions, a trained school counselor led the students through the SSS small group intervention, focusing on anger management, goal setting, social problem-solving and self-management. Study co-authors are Kadeem Campbell, Ph.D., senior author who received his Ph.D. from FAU in 2023; Hannah Bowers, Ph.D., associate professor of school counseling; and Greg Brigman, Ph.D., all within the FAU Department of Counselor Education. Integrating small group counseling into evidence-based school counseling programs enables counselors to help students build supportive peer relationships, develop essential skills, and strengthen their sense of belonging. The authors recommend further research on the long-term and systemic effects of ASE-aligned curricula, along with expanded training for counselors in evidence-based group facilitation. Their findings affirm that school investments in counselor-led interventions grounded in empathy, connection and collaboration foster stronger, more resilient learning communities.

    "headline": "FAU Study: Drones Map Loggerhead Sea Turtle Nesting Site Hotspots",
    "content": "Graduate student and lead author, Summer Manestar, holding the UX11 unmanned aerial vehicle that was used in the study. Study Snapshot: Researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science used drones and field surveys to study how environmental and human factors affect loggerhead sea turtle nest site selection on a high-density beach in Boca Raton. The team looked at beach slope, sand texture, and proximity to structures like dune stairs – wooden stairways that let people safely cross sand dunes without damaging them. Understanding these factors is important because where turtles nest directly affects hatchling survival and sex ratios. The study found that successful nests were more likely on steeper parts of the beach and farther from dune stairs, while false crawls – when sea turtles come ashore but do not lay eggs – were more common in flatter areas or near stairs. These findings give researchers new tools for monitoring nesting activity and help guide efforts to protect Florida’s critical sea turtle habitats. Florida’s beaches – particularly those in Palm Beach County – are among the world’s most vital nesting grounds for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), accounting for 90% of all loggerhead nests in the Southeastern United States. Where a sea turtle chooses to nest is a delicate balance between the energy spent searching for the right spot and the benefits that location provides for successful egg incubation. Because nest placement directly influences hatchling survival, emergence success, and even sex ratios, understanding the factors that guide these decisions is critical. Changing coastal and environmental conditions, sea level rise, and other impacts threaten these fragile habitats, altering the limited environmental conditions that turtles depend on for nesting. By identifying areas with higher or lower nesting activity, researchers can better understand what makes certain habitats more suitable and work to protect them for future generations. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Science have taken an important step in uncovering these patterns. Using drones and surveys, they investigated the environmental and human-related factors that influence loggerhead sea turtle nest site selection. They also looked at how these factors vary between successful nesting attempts and false crawls – when a turtle emerges from the ocean but returns without laying eggs. The research led by Summer L. Manestar, who completed her M.S. in marine science and oceanography in FAU’s Department of Geosciences, was conducted on a high-density nesting beach in Boca Raton, one of the most active loggerhead nesting regions in the world. Published in the journal Shore & Beach, the study combined drone-based photogrammetry – a technique that uses images captured by drones to create accurate, detailed maps and 3D models of the landscape – Real Time Kinematic GPS surveys, and sediment granulometry to measure beach slope, sand texture, and nest proximity to artificial structures such as dune crossover stairs. Statistical analyses, including generalized linear models and t-tests, were used to assess which environmental and anthropogenic variables most strongly influenced whether a nesting attempt was successful. The results showed that the steepness of the beach and how close dune crossover stairs were to nesting areas were the most important factors influencing turtle nesting. Loggerheads were less likely to attempt nesting on beaches with steeper slopes or when the stairs were farther away. Beach width and sand type did not seem to make much difference. Overall, the distance to dune crossover stairs was consistently important, suggesting that even small changes in the placement of human structures can affect whether turtles successfully nest. Analysis of nesting patterns showed that turtles tended to nest more in the northern and central parts of the beach, while the southern end had fewer nests but more failed attempts. Early in the season, there were many more false crawls than successful nests. Later in the season, the same northern and central areas remained popular for nesting, but false crawls were spread more evenly. Nest locations also shifted over time, with more early-season nests in the mid-beach area and more late-season nests near the backbeach, suggesting that changing conditions influence where turtles lay eggs. “This research really demonstrates how new technology can deepen our understanding of natural processes,” said Tiffany Roberts Briggs, Ph.D., co-author and chair of FAU’s Department of Geosciences. “By combining drone-based mapping with on-the-ground data collection, our team has revealed how even small variations in beach shape or the presence of human structures can influence whether a sea turtle successfully nests. These findings are not just important for science – they directly inform how we manage and protect Florida’s beaches for generations to come.” Compared to satellites or LiDAR, drones provide high-resolution, affordable data that help researchers see small features of the beach that affect where turtles choose to nest. The research team emphasizes that understanding how both natural features and human-made structures influence sea turtle nesting can guide coastal development and conservation policy in meaningful ways. The framework established through this work could also be applied to other species of sea turtles, including green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea), to gain a more comprehensive understanding of nesting ecology along Florida’s dynamic coastline. “Projects like this highlight how innovation and conservation go hand in hand,” said Roberts Briggs. “When we can pinpoint what makes a beach successful for nesting, we can take concrete steps to ensure that Florida remains a haven for these incredible animals.” Study co-author is James Gammack-Clark, a senior instructor in the FAU Department of Geosciences.

    "headline": "FAU Engineering Study Takes a 'Quantum Leap' to Detect Kidney Disease",
    "content": "Researchers explored how machine learning and quantum computing can be used to improve early detection of chronic kidney disease, aiming to develop faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for clinicians. Study Snapshot: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) gradually damages the kidneys and often shows few symptoms until it is advanced, making early detection difficult. Millions of people worldwide are affected, and timely diagnosis is critical to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Traditional detection methods can be slow and may miss subtle signs of the disease, highlighting the need for faster, more accurate tools. Researchers are exploring how machine learning and quantum computing can help. In a new study, they compared a classical machine learning system with a quantum-based approach to detect CKD. While the classical system proved more accurate and faster under current conditions, the quantum system still showed promising results, suggesting that hybrid quantum-classical tools could play an important role in the future. This work points toward smarter, faster and more precise diagnostic systems that could ultimately help clinicians detect CKD earlier and improve patient care. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one such condition – a progressive illness that damages the kidneys over time, eventually leading to kidney failure if left untreated. Because CKD develops gradually and often shows few symptoms in its early stages, timely diagnosis is a major clinical challenge. Globally, an estimated 850 million people are living with some form of kidney disease. Among them, as many as 10 million require dialysis or kidney transplantation to survive. Despite the scale of this problem, CKD frequently goes undetected until it reaches an advanced stage. Early diagnosis is essential not only to slow disease progression but also to improve quality of life and survival rates. To help address this widespread issue, researchers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) to build automated tools that can detect CKD more efficiently and accurately. ML algorithms can recognize subtle patterns in complex medical data – patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed by clinicians. Research from the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University is taking this concept further by exploring how quantum computing could enhance the accuracy and performance of ML-driven CKD diagnosis systems. Arslan Munir, Ph.D., senior author and an associate professor in the FAU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and his colleagues from Bangladesh, developed and compared two automated systems for CKD diagnosis: the Classical Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM). The goal of their study was to evaluate the efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of both approaches, and to better understand how emerging quantum machine learning techniques could eventually revolutionize real-world medical diagnostics. The team began by preparing and refining a CKD dataset, applying comprehensive data preprocessing to ensure the reliability of results. They then used two advanced data optimization methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce noise and improve computational efficiency. Each optimized dataset was subsequently analyzed using both CSVM and QSVM algorithms, allowing for a detailed comparison of the two methods’ predictive capabilities. The results of the study, published in the journal Informatics and Health, revealed clear differences. When paired with PCA, CSVM achieved a remarkable 98.75% accuracy, while QSVM reached 87.5%. Using SVD, the CSVM achieved 96.25%, compared to 60% for the QSVM. The classical SVM also proved far faster: up to 42 times quicker than the QSVM in certain experimental settings. The outcome indicates that, under current hardware conditions, the classical approach remains superior in both accuracy and time efficiency. However, Munir and his colleagues emphasized that QSVM’s underperformance is primarily a reflection of today’s computational limitations rather than the potential of quantum algorithms themselves. Even within the constraints of classical hardware, the QSVM still achieved competitive performance – its 87.5% accuracy using PCA surpasses that of several existing classical SVM methods reported in prior studies. This suggests that hybrid quantum-classical systems could play an increasingly important role in the near term, combining the strengths of both paradigms to improve diagnostic precision while managing current technological challenges. “What makes our work unique is that we didn’t just apply classical machine learning to detect chronic kidney disease – we also tested a quantum version under the same conditions,” said Munir. “By directly comparing classical and quantum models, and using two different optimization methods, we gained valuable insight into where the technology stands today and how quantum computing could help shape the future of health care analytics.” Looking ahead, the research team plans to extend their work by exploring additional quantum ML algorithms beyond QSVM and testing their methods on larger, more diverse medical datasets. They also intend to focus on optimizing feature selection techniques to ensure scalability and adaptability across a wide range of diagnostic applications. Ultimately, the goal is to create more reliable, efficient and accessible AI-driven diagnostic tools that can assist clinicians in making faster, more accurate medical decisions. “This research is an important leap toward bringing quantum computing into health care – an emerging field with the power to transform how we detect and treat complex diseases,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “By combining machine learning with next-generation quantum technologies, this work offers real hope for earlier, faster and more accurate diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, ultimately improving outcomes and saving lives.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",
