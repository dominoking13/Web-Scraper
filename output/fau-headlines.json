    "headline": "FAU Engineers Create Smarter AI to Redefine Control in Complex Systems",
    "content": "A new AI framework improves management of complex systems with unequal decision-makers, like smart grids, traffic networks, and autonomous vehicles. A new artificial intelligence breakthrough developed by researchers in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University offers a smarter, more efficient way to manage complex systems that rely on multiple decision-makers operating at different levels of authority. This novel framework, recently published in IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems, could significantly impact the future of smart energy grids, traffic networks and autonomous vehicle systems – technologies that are becoming increasingly central to daily life. In many real-world systems, decisions don’t happen simultaneously or equally. A utility company might decide when to cut power during peak hours, and households must adjust their energy use in response. In traffic systems, central controllers dictate signals while vehicles adapt accordingly. “These types of systems operate under a power hierarchy, where one player makes the first move and others must follow, and they’re more complicated than typical AI models assume,” said Zhen Ni, Ph.D., senior author, IEEE senior member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Traditional AI methods often treat every decision-maker as equal, operating at the same time with the same level of influence. While this makes for clean simulations, it doesn’t reflect how decisions are actually made in real-world scenarios – especially in environments full of uncertainty, limited bandwidth and uneven access to information.” To address this, Ni and Xiangnan Zhong, Ph.D., first author, IEEE member and an associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, designed a new AI framework based on reinforcement learning, a technique that allows intelligent agents to learn from interacting with their environment over time. Their approach adds two key innovations. First, it structures the decision-making process using a game theory model called the Stackelberg-Nash game, where a “leader” agent acts first and “follower” agents respond in an optimal way. This hierarchy better mirrors systems like energy management, connected transportation and autonomous driving. Second, the researchers introduced an event-triggered mechanism that reduces the computational burden. “Instead of constantly updating decisions at every time step, which is typical of many AI systems, our method updates decisions only when necessary, saving energy and processing power while maintaining performance and stability,” said Zhong. The result is a system that not only handles the power asymmetry between decision-makers but also deals with mismatched uncertainties – cases where different players operate with varying levels of information and predictability. This is especially critical in environments like smart grids or traffic control systems, where conditions change rapidly and resources are often limited. The framework allows for a more robust, adaptive and scalable form of AI control that can make better use of limited bandwidth and computing resources. “This work fills a crucial gap in the current AI landscape. By developing a method that reflects real-world decision hierarchies and adapts to imperfect information, Professors Zhong and Ni are helping us move closer to practical, intelligent systems that can handle the complexity of our modern infrastructure,” said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. “The implications of this research are far-reaching. Whether it’s optimizing power consumption across cities or making autonomous systems more reliable, this kind of innovation is foundational to the future of intelligent technology. It represents a step forward not just for AI research, but for the everyday systems we depend on.” Backed by rigorous theoretical analysis and validated through simulation studies, Zhong and Ni demonstrated that their event-triggered reinforcement learning method maintains system stability, ensures optimal strategy outcomes and effectively reduces unnecessary computation. The approach combines deep control theory with practical machine learning, offering a compelling path forward for intelligent control in asymmetric, uncertain environments. Two related journal articles have recently been published on IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence as well. The research work is mainly supported by the National Science Foundation and the United States Department of Transportation. The research team is now working on expanding their model for larger-scale testing in real-world scenarios. Their long-term vision is to integrate this AI framework into operational systems that power cities, manage traffic and coordinate fleets of autonomous machines – bringing the promise of smarter infrastructure one step closer to reality.

    "headline": "Logistics Industry Mixed as Smaller Firms Face Rising Costs",
    "content": "The logistics industry demonstrated mixed signals across its key indicators, as smaller firms try to hedge increasing costs, according to researchers from Florida Atlantic University and four other schools. The logistics industry demonstrated mixed signals across its key indicators, as smaller firms try to hedge increasing costs, according to researchers from Florida Atlantic University and four other schools. August’s reading came in at 59.3, a slight uptick from July’s 59.2, but far below the historical average of 61.5, according to the Logistics Managers Index. Any score above 50 indicates the industry is expanding; a score below 50 suggests contraction. Inventory levels (58.2) and Inventory costs (79.2) rose 2.7 and 7.3 points, respectively, as companies started stocking more goods and inventory became more expensive to hold, contributing to August’s slight increase. Drops in transportation levels and transportation prices contributed downward pressure to this month’s reading. “Given the fluctuating regulatory environment associated with tariff rates and import duties, it appears that firms are consuming more warehouse capacity, as this metric is approaching contraction, and the prices associated with warehousing are up,” said Steven Carnovale, Ph.D., associate professor of supply chain management in FAU’s College of Business. The LMI, a survey of director-level and above supply chain executives, measures the expansion or contraction of the logistics industry using eight unique components: inventory levels, inventory costs, warehousing capacity, warehousing utilization, warehousing prices, transportation capacity, transportation utilization and transportation prices. Along with FAU, researchers at Arizona State University, Colorado State University, Rutgers University, and the University of Nevada at Reno calculated the LMI using a diffusion index. Continuing the trend observed over the last four months, logistics expansion was being disproportionately driven by smaller firms (firms with less than 1,000 employees). Small firms reported an overall index of 62.7, higher than the 58.2 reading reported by larger firms (firms with more than 1,000 employees). “Typically, larger firms have higher buying power and can act more quickly and in larger volumes, such as bulk importing of goods ahead of any published tariff rate increases. We saw this activity in previous reports,” Carnovale said. “This month’s data show that smaller firms are responding to try to hedge cost increases, and this is reflected in their higher overall logistics activity.” The previous gap between upstream firms, or manufacturers and suppliers, and downstream firms, or retailers, disappeared in August, a trend researchers believe indicates better flow through the supply chain. Higher upstream activity with manufacturers and suppliers suggests that the rest of the supply chain will have more logistics activity as products are pushed downstream to retailers. “The shift to higher activity in the downstream suggests that supply chains might be showing stability, but the higher price indexes may result in increased prices to consumers in the coming months,” Carnovale said. “This, coupled with reports of decreased consumer sentiment and spending, needs to be monitored as we enter the forthcoming holiday season.” If you are experiencing difficulty accessing information on the Florida Atlantic University website due to a disability, visit the website accessibility page.",

    "headline": "Decoding a Decade of Grouper Grunts Unlocks Spawning Secrets, Shifts",
    "content": "A red hind grouper, which produces sounds associated with courtship, territoriality or mating. More than a decade of acoustic recordings of grouper grunts are providing new insight into how sound can be used to monitor and manage vulnerable fish populations. The research by Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute focused on the red hind (Epinephelus guttatus), a commercially important Caribbean grouper species. Red hind are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as females and later becoming males. Each winter, they travel more than 30 kilometers to offshore sites to spawn under the full moon in large gatherings. Males use rhythmic, low-frequency sounds to attract mates and to defend territory. This predictable behavior makes them especially vulnerable to overfishing during spawning season. Rather than traditional survey methods, FAU Harbor Branch and FAU College of Engineering and Computer Science researchers, in collaboration with HJR Reefscaping, the University of the Virgin Islands, and the University of Puerto Rico, turned to passive acoustic monitoring. This technique enables continuous, long-term monitoring of reproductive behavior, even in remote or hard-to-access areas, without disrupting the animals or their habitat. To examine how red hind reproductive behavior has changed over time, researchers analyzed more than 2,000 hours of underwater recordings from a single spawning site off Puerto Rico’s west coast, continuously monitored since 2007. Unlike most acoustic studies that track general sound levels, this research focused on specific mating calls tied to distinct behaviors. Red hind produce two primary sound types – one for courtship and another for territorial defense. Tracking these sounds over time allowed researchers to detect subtle shifts in spawning behavior and population dynamics. The result, published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, is one of the most extensive and uninterrupted acoustic datasets ever assembled for a reef fish species. The analysis confirmed a consistent seasonal pattern in red hind spawning activity, closely aligned with lunar cycles. However, one of the most striking findings was a notable shift in the balance of call types over the 12-year period. Between 2011 and 2017, calls linked to courtship were more common. But starting in 2018, calls linked to competition and territorial behavior became dominant – nearly tripling over the study period. “This shift could indicate changes in the population, such as an increase in the number of older or more dominant males, changes in sex ratios, or even a shift in the core spawning area,” said Laurent Chérubin, Ph.D., lead author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch. Researchers also observed more frequent and multiple peaks in sound production in recent years, suggesting that spawning may now be spread over more days in each lunar cycle than in the past. These changes could be responses to environmental or population shifts. Importantly, the study shows that passive acoustic monitoring can be a powerful tool for tracking reproductive behavior over time and detecting early signs of population or behavioral change – information that is critical for managing and conserving red hind and similar reef fish species. “What’s remarkable is that even a single underwater microphone can reveal so much about fish populations,” said Chérubin. “With consistent long-term monitoring, we can pick up early warning signs – like shifts in spawning behavior or population stress – and give resource managers the information they need to adapt conservation strategies before it’s too late.” At the center of the analysis was an advanced machine-learning tool called FADAR (fish acoustic detection algorithm research). This custom-built acoustic classifier allowed the team to detect and distinguish between different types of mating calls with extraordinary speed and accuracy. “This study shows how much we can learn simply by listening,” said Chérubin. “Thanks to FADAR, we processed 12 years of acoustic data in weeks – uncovering patterns that would have taken years to find. It’s a game changer for monitoring and managing reef fish like red hind.” “As passive acoustics advances, it’s transforming our understanding of the ocean,” said Chérubin. “By tuning in to underwater soundscapes, we’re discovering not just when and where fish spawn, but how those patterns change over time – offering vital insights into the health of marine ecosystems.” Study co-authors are Caroline Woodward, United States Geological Survey; Michelle Schärer-Umpierre, Ph.D., associate researcher, HJR Reefscaping and the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez; Richard S. Nemeth, Ph.D., research professor, Center for Marine and Environmental Studies, University of the Virgin Islands; Richard Appeldoorn, Ph.D., a faculty member; and Evan Tuhoy, a Ph.D. candidate, both within the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Puerto Rico; and Ali K.

    "headline": "FAU Publishes Initial Annual Report: Florida Office of Ocean Economy",
    "content": "Housed at FAU, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries. Few places in the world are as closely tied to the ocean as Florida. From our working waterfronts and bustling ports to fishing, tourism and recreation, the ocean is not just a natural asset; it is a cornerstone of our state’s economy and identity. As such, in 2024 the Florida legislature selected Florida Atlantic University to house its Florida Office of Ocean Economy, a state effort to better understand, support and grow the ocean and coastal-based industries that drive jobs, investment and innovation across the state. FAU has published its initial annual report for the Florida Office of Ocean Economy. Established by the Florida legislature in 2024 under the visionary leadership of the Florida legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida Office of Ocean Economy was created to position the state as a global leader in ocean-linked industries. Serving as a central hub for collaboration across business, research, capital and policy, the office is building the foundation for a thriving ocean economy. “Florida Atlantic is proud to be the home of the state’s Office of Ocean Economy, a vital initiative advancing economic growth through the sustainable use of our ocean and coastal resources,” said FAU President Adam Hasner. “As a nationally recognized leader in marine science, ocean engineering and environmental research, Florida Atlantic is deeply committed to driving innovation, protecting ecosystems and preparing the next generation of talent. We look forward to working alongside our partners to cultivate an ocean economy that delivers opportunity, security and prosperity for every Floridian.” Florida’s ocean economy is a vital and complex system that fuels prosperity across the state and serves as a cornerstone of its identity. With thousands of miles of coastline and a vibrant marine and coastal landscape, Florida supports a diverse set of industries that rely on healthy ocean resources, from ports and seafood to tourism and recreation. In 2023 alone, ocean-related activity sustained approximately 909,000 jobs, generated $59 billion in labor income and contributed $96 billion in Gross State Product. This represents more than 6% of the state’s total economic output, making Florida not only the largest ocean economy by employment in the United States, but also one of the most ocean-dependent economies in the world. Florida’s ocean economy is guided by a robust framework of state initiatives and programs that sustain the economic productivity of coastal regions while protecting vital marine resources. From strategic port investments and aquaculture development to coastal resilience and beach renourishment, the state’s policy architecture enables Florida to lead the nation in ocean-related employment and economic activity. The Florida Office of Ocean Economy will continue to collaborate closely with a diverse network of partners across sectors and disciplines. Key partners include state agencies and academic institutions such as the Florida Institute of Oceanography and other universities; federally funded research centers; industry leaders in marine transportation, tourism, aquaculture and renewable energy; nonprofit organizations focused on ocean conservation; federal agencies including NOAA and the U.S. Department of Energy; and private sector innovators driving marine technology and infrastructure development. This broad coalition strengthens Florida’s ocean economy by aligning resources, expertise and strategic vision toward sustainable growth and resilience.
