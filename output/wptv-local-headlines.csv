Deputies were called out for a domestic disturbance in the 7400 block of 43rd Terrace North Tuesday evening. Man with machete shot by deputies in unincorporated Palm Beach County As deputies were trying to locate the caller, victim and suspect, they say the situation quickly fell apart after deputies say a young man walked out and retrieved a “foot and a half long machete.”“It was strategically placed in the hedges where he knew where to go retrieve it,” said Chief Deputy Robert Allen. “He immediately raised it above his head and began approaching the deputies in a fairly aggressive manner.” PBSO Chief Deputy Allen says deputies tried repeatedly to get the man to put it down, but they say he wouldn’t.“[Deputies] finally had no other recourse but to stop his aggressive actions by firing on him,” said Chief Deputy Allen. “That stopped his actions.”Investigators say the young man has been taken to a hospital to undergo surgery. They say he is listed in critical condition.“Thank God, none of our deputies were injured,” said Chief Deputy Allen.They say they believe only one deputy fired their service weapon, but further investigation is needed to be sure. They say the deputy or deputies found to have fired their weapons will be placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, as per agency protocol.PBSO also say the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, and PBSO’s Violent Crimes Division are actively investigating the incident.This is a developing story, we will keep you updated as we work to learn more.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/shooting-investigation-near-palm-lakes-estate"
"Stay or go? New ordinances could impact this city's homeless populations","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyLake Worth Beach Stay or go? New ordinances could impact Lake Worth Beach's homeless populations WPTV's Joel Lopez is listening to concerns from people in Lake Worth Beach about the growing population of people experiencing homelessness and the safety issues it is bringing. WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated LAKE WORTH BEACH, Fla. — WPTV is listening to concerns from people in Lake Worth Beach about the growing population of people experiencing homelessness and the safety issues it is bringing.WATCH BELOW: 'We need to just honor each other as humans and listen,' Amy Hamel tells WPTV New ordinances could impact Lake Worth Beach's homeless populations That statement captures a growing unease as neighbors said they want answers.Residents told WPTV they're seeing more people experiencing homelessness and they’re using drugs, showering, even going to the bathroom in public areas.For many who walk downtown every day, the change is visible and personal.""It's a bigger problem than what Lake Worth or any community should have to deal with,"" said Lake Worth Beach resident Greg Rice.He and his wife walk through the core of the city regularly and said the encounters are frequent. ""It makes me worry about my wife, it doesn't take but one incident to change everybody's life overnight,"" Rice said. West Palm Beach Warnings, fines to be issued for feeding large groups without permit Joel Lopez During the interview with WPTV, a person that was seemingly experiencing homelessness shouted at storefronts down the road — a scene Rice said is not rare.""I've seen them walk around this side and that side of the building, just pull their pants down and squat and that is really embarrassing to see. Change has to happen,"" he said.Public spaces like the Cultural Plaza and Bryant Park have become gathering places to those unhoused both during the day and at night.For some neighbors, compassion and fear sit side-by-side. ""I like very much being able to walk safely up and down the street but we need to just honor each other as humans and listen,"" said Amy Hamel.WATCH BELOW: Organization faces fine for feeding homeless without permit Organization faces fine for feeding homeless without permit She lives near Bryant Park and said those without shelter need help now more than ever.""I wish I could feed all of them, I wish I could keep them warm,"" she said.City leaders acknowledge the challenge, confirming it's an issue and it’s working on ordinances to address people’s concerns.WPTV turned to Commissioner Mimi May, who has been advocating for changes to local rules ordinances.""My biggest concern right now is finding a balance and finding a balance with respect to the dignity of the people who are homeless and allowing them to share our city. But also we have law and order where there’s no drinking, there’s no using drugs, there’s no public defecation, you know? And for those things we need to make sure that we are protecting the city and enacting our ordinances,"" May said, noting her aim is to protect public safety, while respecting the rights of those without shelter. Palm Beach County How much will it cost? Palm Beach Co. prepares to enforce new homeless law Joel Lopez One contentious topic: Unregulated public feedings at the parks.While volunteers and neighbors want to help, May warned of unintended consequences. ""If you're getting fed in the same place every single day, you're not going anywhere and you're basically living in the parks"" she said, adding that clean-up costs fall to city staff when volunteers leave behind trash.An ordinance is in the works that would require food distributions in city parks to be permitted.It's a system modeled similar to West Palm Beach, that issues fines to large groups feeding without a permit.WATCH BELOW: Palm Beach County to spend $800K to enforce Florida's new homeless law Palm Beach County to spend $800K to enforce Florida's new homeless law May hopes the rule will encourage coordinated efforts with nonprofits that have established regulations and wraparound services at private locations, not city parks.The public feeding ordinance is expected to go into effect in the next couple of months. May said the goal is straightforward.""We would like to make sure that everybody eats, but there are services available and we would like to see them use those services,"" she said.City officials are also revising their trespass language to give staff clearer authority to address people loitering at municipal buildings, like city hall and libraries. Lake Worth Beach Park rangers could soon patrol these parks as city approves $500K safety program Vannia Joseph ""We're doing our part and we need help from the county, we need help from the other municipalities, and we need help from the actual homeless,"" May said, urging a coordinated response.Last year, WPTV reported Palm Beach County's Parks and Recreation Department is spending $800,000 on overnight park rangers to enforce a state rule banning sleeping overnight in public areas.County staff noted that their rangers only patrol county parks mostly in unincorporated Palm Beach County.When asked about enforcement, representatives said their rangers interact with both sheltered and unsheltered park visitors daily, but that park rangers have not been called to any businesses about issues with someone experiencing homelessness.Lake Worth Beach leaders hope to create a similar Park Ranger program, independent from county operations, so city officers can patrol and monitor public areas directly.","https://www.wptv.com/region-c-palm-beach-county/lake-worth-beach/stay-or-go-new-ordinances-could-impact-lake-worth-beachs-homeless-populations"

"Renner urges immediate property tax rollback","MoneyReal Estate News Former House Speaker Paul Renner urges immediate property tax rollback Forrest Saunders Twitter Paul Renner By: Forrest Saunders Posted TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former House Speaker Paul Renner is urging lawmakers to approve a property tax rollback this year, saying Florida families can't wait for a 2026 ballot fight. This comes as the governor and Florida House leaders seem poised for a high-profile clash over how best to deliver relief.Renner, a 2026 GOP candidate for governor, said the Legislature can mandate a rollback on the counties similar to what it did in 2006–07. At the time, lawmakers were concerned that incomes weren't keeping up with rising property tax rates.""They did that in a way that looked at how counties had responded,"" said Renner. ""If they had not raised their taxes for the intervening five years, they got a lower rollback.""In an interview this week, Renner argued it was time for the state to act again because ""people are actually losing their homes.""""Give people the relief they need to stay in their homes and give them some help,"" Renner said. ""Make sure property taxes don't go up again this year. That's paramount, and so that's what I'm calling for.""Renner wasn't opposed to some of the long-term reforms currently under consideration — like protecting longtime residents and first-time homebuyers from high property taxes. His concern was that ballot measures take years to enact.""If you wanted to eliminate all homestead property taxes… all of those have to go to the ballot, get 60%,"" Renner said. ""Well, that's next November, and then you wouldn't see the benefit of that until November of 2027. That's two years from now, and that's too late."" DeSantis Blasts House Plan as ""Milquetoast"" Renner's push comes a few weeks after Gov. Ron DeSantis sharply criticized the Florida House's package of seven constitutional amendments and one bill.At a Tampa news conference in October, the governor blasted the House proposals, which Speaker Danny Perez, R-Miami, had announced in a memo to lawmakers days earlier.""You have to have one amendment,"" DeSantis said. ""It's got to be very clearly written and give people a chance to vote for it. What you don't do is put five on there. … It offends me because they think you're stupid enough for them to tell you, 'Oh no, we're supportive of you. We put it up. We put stuff on the ballot. We tried.' They can't think you're that stupid, right?""DeSantis said none of the House proposals ""would get people excited"" and signaled his own forthcoming plan will aim for the complete elimination of property taxes for homesteaded Florida homeowners.""You have a home, you're homesteaded,"" said DeSantis. ""You should own it. You shouldn’t be taxed — it shouldn't be an ATM for the local government."" House Speaker Perez Fires Back House Speaker Danny Perez unveiled the chamber’s slate of ideas back on October 16. In his memo he called it a chance for voters to decide what to do on property taxes rather than the legislature.""If we have faith in the voters to elect us, we should not be afraid to let them be a part of the conversation about the taxes they pay,"" he wrote.After DeSantis' rebuke, Perez responded forcefully, saying the governor was being either ""small and petty, or he has just revealed something significant today about his mysterious property tax plan.""""The House has proposed eliminating all non-school homestead property taxes,"" Perez wrote in a statement. ""The Governor weirdly called that 'milquetoast.' That can only mean the Governor has just announced that he will be proposing to abolish all property taxes including school taxes.""Perez challenged the governor to explain ""the $21 billion for schools that he plans to cut."" House Democrats Caution Property Tax Rollbacks Democrats warn the plan risks deep cuts to essential services. House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell, D-Tampa, condemned major property tax rollbacks recently, saying drastic cuts will have drastic impacts.""What firehouse would he come and close in Tampa?"" Driskell asked. ""What police station would he close in Orlando?""She and other Democrats in the legislature have offered their own ideas on addressing Florida's high costs. The caucus is seeking further property insurance reforms, calling the issue ""the heart of the affordability crisis.""All 11 Democrats in the Senate have filed or plan to file bills to rein in rising premiums, which now average roughly $3,800 annually statewide. That's among the highest in the nation. Some estimates suggest rates are even higher.""People are struggling to stay in their homes just because of their property insurance alone,"" said Senate Minority Leader Lori Berman of Palm Beach County, who took over the caucus this year.

By: Kayla McDermott Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A small group of protesters gathered at the Florida State Capitol on Tuesday, demanding the abolishment of homeowners associations statewide. The rally comes just one week after a deadly shooting in Port St. Lucie that left three people dead, including the neighborhood's HOA treasurer and the husband of the HOA secretary. WATCH: HOA resident thinks associations can be managed better Local homeowners express frustrations with HOAs The 62-year-old shooter took his own life after killing two neighbors in what authorities say was connected to HOA disputes.For months, residents across Florida have raised concerns about the rising costs and restrictive rules tied to homeowners associations. With thousands of HOAs across the state and hundreds in Palm Beach County alone, some residents are actively pushing for their complete elimination.Dave Hyland, who has lived in an HOA community for 20 years, understands both sides of the debate. He appreciates the amenities his association provides. ""I like the standard of living and the safety it brings,"" Hyland said. ""There's two pools, there's a gym. We have guard gates."" But the steep and rising costs have him questioning the value. ""You question, what am I really getting for the money that I'm contributing,"" Hyland said.

Juan Carlos Porras, R-Miami, is working on new legislation that would allow communities to abolish their HOAs, giving the power directly to residents. ""In my personal opinion, I think HOA is our failed experiment, and there needs to be some sort of guidelines in place on how to get rid of them,"" Porras said.However, Hyland isn't entirely comfortable with that approach, worried about majority rule overriding individual preferences.

"Code enforcement officer found stealing time later became a supervisor","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach A code enforcement officer was found stealing time, then became a supervisor in this city WPTV obtained records showing the employee was accused of stealing more than 100 hours WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A West Palm Beach code enforcement officer was placed on a 17-day suspension after the city suspected the employee stole more than 114 hours, according to documents WPTV obtained.The records show Donald Williams was also given a “last chance notice” after the city’s investigation found he incorrectly clocked into and out of work, took extended lunch breaks and was not in his enforcement zone. WATCH: Officer was given 'last chance notice' after city investigation Code enforcement officer found stealing time later became a supervisor A spokesperson for the city said the employee is now acting as code enforcement supervisor as it goes through the hiring process for a permanent supervisor.“The City of West Palm Beach does not comment on personnel matters,” said city spokesperson Kat Joy. “Code Officer Donald Williams is currently serving as acting Code Enforcement Supervisor as we go through the hiring process for a permanent supervisor. The City is actively recruiting for the supervisor position.” According to the administrative review, Williams clocked in for 124 hours that were unearned. The review said a majority of those hours came from “clocking in” before starting work and leaving work before “clocking out” as a code enforcement officer focusing on rental license compliance and business openings across the city. City investigators found this happened around 115 times from Aug. 1, 2024 to Jan. 31, 2025, which resulted in hours being stolen ranging from .1 to 4.23.Williams didn’t respond to WPTV’s inquiry. West Palm Beach 5 areas in this city lack code enforcement officer Ethan Stein City investigators said they also found Williams spent about five hours conducting non-work-related trips and another six hours at his house taking excessive breaks from his job across the city. Williams' house is a less than five minutes from Hugh Booker’s house, who told WPTV’s he’s struggling to get code enforcement to take action against two plots of land: an abandoned construction site and an overgrown lot. ""It's frustrating because when I came here they were real strict with everything,” he said. “Now you go out there and look at that property and tell me if you'd like to live in a neighborhood like that.”Booker said he’s even gone to city hall to get somebody’s attention, but nobody has done anything about either property. He said reviewing the city’s investigation was frustrating because it feels like code enforcement is ignoring his neighborhood.""I tried so much to get somebody down here to do something that I don't bother anymore because you don't get any response,"" Booker said to WPTV’s Ethan Stein last week. WPTV talked with Booker because we found records online showing multiple areas of West Palm Beach don’t have an assigned code enforcement officer. Those records show five out of 14 areas, about 35%, list the assigned code enforcement agent as vacant. One week later, the city’s website said it assigned three more additional officers to areas.The website said Williams is assigned to the city’s downtown area, from Okeechobee Boulevard to Banyan Boulevard. His assignment came after the city went nine months without a code enforcement officer in the area.

The Martin County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) posted a warning to residents and businesses, saying that they're seeing a recent increase in counterfeit $20 bills. They say local businesses have already been impacted by the fake bills, and that they can be ""extremely difficult to detect at first glance."" They ask business owners to verify bills before a customer leaves, as ""Suspects have taken the cash and quickly exited the store before the clerk tested the bill and determined it was fake."" MCSO told WPTV that some of the businesses affected include Wawa and Culver's off Kanner Highway, a Dunkin' off Town Center Way and Crumbl Cookies off Monterey Road. ""I try to look at my cash before I use it,"" resident Carolyn Davis told WPTV. ""I’ve been in the restaurant business for a long time so I’ve had police officers show me to look for counterfeit. But yeah, it’s a horrible thing because not everyone pays attention to what cash they have in their wallets."" MCSO provided the following tips for spotting counterfeit bills: Check for color-shifting ink. Tilt the bill and look for the number “20” in the lower right corner to shift color. Feel the texture. Genuine currency has raised printing and a distinctive paper feel.Look for the security thread. A real $20 bill has a visible embedded strip that glows green under UV light.Use a counterfeit detection pen when possible, especially in busy retail settings.Compare suspicious bills to a known genuine bill of the same denomination.Trust your instincts. If something feels off about the look, texture, or printing quality, don’t accept the bill.If you think you or your business encountered the counterfeit bills, contact the sheriff's office.","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-martin-county/martin-county-sheriffs-office-warns-about-increase-in-counterfeit-20-bills"

Trump Presidential Library in downtown Miami is escalating.The state's CFO, Blaise Ingoglia, has now filed an amicus brief supporting Miami Dade College in its fight to overturn a temporary injunction blocking the land transfer.In a statement, Ingoglia called the lawsuit ""a blatant political attack … and a weaponization of Florida's court system,"" adding that, ""We will not allow political activists to use the system as an attempt to prevent students, Floridians and international visitors from learning about the historic accomplishments of our great president.""WATCH BELOW: Proposed Trump library in Miami sparks backlash Trump Presidential Library planned for downtown Miami, sparking backlash The state approved the project Sept. 30, when Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet unanimously voted to convey nearly three acres of Miami-Dade College land for what supporters said would be a ""bold landmark"" next to the Freedom Tower.During that meeting, DeSantis said it was ""a unique opportunity for the state,"" while Attorney General James Uthmeier said Trump ""has a great story to tell.""The president's son, Eric Trump, heads the library's foundation and called it one of ""the most beautiful buildings ever built.""However, critics blasted the land transfer as rushed and lacking transparency.State Sen.

The plan includes 781 residential units, 150,000 square feet of retail space, 68,276 square feet of office, 2,729 parking spaces, and a 185-room hotel.WATCH BELOW: Boca Raton residents push back on massive 77-acre development near I-95 Residents push back on massive 77-acre development near I-95 in Boca Raton Some neighbors, including Greg Koslowski, who live adjacent to the site, are raising concerns about traffic, noise and impacts to wildlife.""There's coyotes back here, there's fox, turtles, all kinds of wildlife that I don’t know where they're going to go,"" said Koslowski.Koslowski's main concern is congestion in the neighborhood, as Torah Academy across the street is already expanding.The project will also include restaurants, a grocery store, a transit center and park space.""It's going to be Mizner Park times seven in this little patch of area,"" resident Roxanna Trinka said. ""We don't have the infrastructure to support it.""WPTV reporter Zitlali Solache also heard from some neighbors who support the plan, but others questioned if high-rise buildings near the flight path of airport planes would be impacted.""They come in very low, right over the treetops,"" said Koslowski. ""I can't imagine what kind of buildings or structures they can put in there without impeding on that airspace.”According to the master plan, developers said mixing housing with retail and office space would reduce traffic.

LUCIE, Fla. — A family in Port St. Lucie is dealing with the tragic death of a 5-year-old boy with autism who was found dead in a neighborhood lake Monday after wandering away from home. The child, identified by police as Neymir Luka Valere, was last seen about 4:30 p.m. Monday. However, police told WPTV he wasn't reported missing until 8 p.m. WATCH BELOW: Missing boy's body found in lake Body of missing child with autism found in lake Police then responded to a home in the 5200 block of Northwest Wisk Fern Circle at about 8:08 p.m.Units, including road patrol, K9, drone pilots, the Marine Unit and Air Unit from the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office, canvassed the area for the boy, whose body was found in a lake shortly before 11:30 p.m. Police Chief Leo Niemczyk said there was a misunderstanding about who was watching the boy.""The mother thought the child was with the older sibling in a room upstairs in the house, and later on, she ends up discovering the other child had left,"" Niemczyk said.Police are calling this a tragic accident, and the parents of the 5-year-old will not be facing any charges. This is the second child to be found dead in a lake in the last three months. Port St. Lucie police said this particular case is difficult because the child wasn't reported missing for several hours. Project Livesaver Last month, WPTV reported that the city's Project Lifesaver safety program, which helps track individuals prone to wandering, will continue operating after receiving new funding.Project Lifesaver provides tracking devices to individuals who may be at risk of eloping, like those with autism, Alzheimer's disease or dementia. The devices allow law enforcement to locate missing persons using specialized transmitters.WPTV learned Tuesday that Port St. Lucie police are preparing to roll out a tracking system that allows caregivers and police to monitor a loved one's location using a cellphone app. Police said their message to the community is to notify them if they are caring for someone with dementia or autism so they can provide the proper services and report a missing endangered person immediately.","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/active-search-for-missing-5-year-old-with-autism-in-port-st-lucie"

"Teacher facing charges was rehired despite previous misconduct allegations","NewsEducation Teacher facing charges was rehired despite previous misconduct allegations A new lawsuit claims multiple employees observed Pierce’s excessive attention to female students at Tradewinds Middle School WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — The School District of Palm Beach County hired a man as a substitute teacher even though he resigned from another school for inappropriate behavior with students, according to a new federal lawsuit.Students would later complain about the teacher, Corey Pierce, being seen kissing students from Woodlands Middle School. Pierce is now facing two counts of lewd or lascivious battery by authority figure of a school after his arrest in March. Teacher facing charges was rehired despite previous school misconduct claims The documents WPTV’s Ethan Stein reviewed over the last month related to the case create new questions about why Pierce was allowed to leave his original job at Tradewinds Middle School, then get a job at another school within the school district as a substitute teacher. According to a Title IX investigation report, Pierce was “let go/fired” from teaching at Tradewinds Middle School. However, the detail contradicts his personnel file showing he resigned from his job as an employee within the school office in January 2024. Payroll records WPTV reviewed show before his resignation, Pierce suddenly started having days where he was marked as “without pay,” starting in October 2023. However, emails WPTV received show no district internal investigation was open until Pierce’s arrest.This new lawsuit claims multiple employees observed Pierce’s excessive attention to female students at Tradewinds Middle School and it reached the level where Pierce had to resign from his position at the school. However, the school didn’t investigate the employee nor did employees report those behaviors to school administrators, which in turn allowed the employee to get another position within the same district. Education 2 school district staffers accused of inappropriate relations with students “School Board knew or should have known that Pierce was not fit for service as a school employee and that he never should have been permitted to be around children,” the lawsuit reads. “Pierce has concerning behavior patterns were observable to multiple employees yet school board failed to properly investigate, failed to take corrective action and ultimately made the catastrophic decision to rehire him after his resignation, directly enabling the continuation of his abuse of (VICTIM) and multiple other students.”Pierce would get a new position at Woodlands Middle School as a substitute teacher in February 2024. The teacher, according to a Title IX investigation report, was then accused of trying to lean over and kiss a student in March, then trying to touch the student’s butt along with messaging students on social media and other inappropriate touching in March 2024.The lawsuit also claims district investigators didn’t follow protocol when interviewing their client, who is a minor. Attorneys called it “traumatic and unprofessional” to conduct the interview without a counselor present and in a manner that was insensitive to a victim of sexual abuse. This included the investigator laughing about the teacher having “a type” when discussing other victims, which is supported in the body camera footage reviewed by WPTV.The School District of Palm Beach County said it can’t comment on pending litigation in an email. Pierce’s trial, which was supposed to begin on Monday, was rescheduled after a scheduling conflict. His public defender told WPTV they are unable to provide a comment to the lawsuit at this time because the criminal case is ongoing.","https://www.wptv.com/news/education/teacher-facing-charges-was-rehired-despite-previous-misconduct-allegations"
