"'We're still here': Al’s Family Farms re-opens after tornado destruction","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie County 'We're still here': Al’s Family Farms re-opens after tornado destruction After rebuilding from Hurricane Milton tornado damage, the longtime Fort Pierce business welcomes customers back with a taller barn, fresh remodel and renewed community spirit. WPTV Al's Family Farms in Fort Pierce reopened one year after tornado damage caused by Hurricane Milton. By: Cassandra Garcia Posted FORT PIERCE, Fla. — A year after tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Milton tore through St. Lucie County, Al’s Family Farms has reopened its beloved citrus shop, marking a major milestone for the third-generation business and its loyal customers.The shop’s iconic red barn off Kings Highway was packed on Saturday with community members celebrating the return of a local staple many feared might not come back.WATCH: "" We're still here"" - Al's Family Farms reopens to the public one year after Hurricane Milton Al's Family Farms reopens in Fort Pierce one year after Hurricane Milton “Oh we were glad to see that,” said Fort Pierce resident Sandra Foster, who's been visiting Al's Family Farms for the last 12 years.Fresh paint, a taller barn and a remodeled store greeted visitors as they stepped back into one of the few remaining citrus farms in South Florida.“To see it now as it is I think it's just a relief for the community and everybody’s really just excited that we’re still here because they look at us as like a staple in the community,” said Matthew Schorner of Al’s Family Farms.Just over a year ago, the farm’s signature barn was left in disarray. Splintered wood, twisted metal and widespread structural damage littered the property after multiple tornadoes touched down in Fort Pierce. The destruction left a void in the community.“So this is like the last of the Mohegans as far as citrus goes because we actually have a store where you can come and buy your own citrus, get the citrus ice cream,” Schorner said. “We’re the last one that does all that and even makes fresh juice right here.”Instead of replacing everything lost, the Schorner family salvaged what they could, including pieces of the original barn. They embraced the recovery with the help of the community.“If it hadn’t been for folks like you and the community we wouldn’t have had the wind in our sails and we wouldn’t have had, certainly, the strength to do it,” said owner Jeff Schorner during the ribbon-cutting ceremony.Residents like Foster say the rebuild felt remarkably swift considering the scale of damage. “We just keep going by watching the progress, but they did do it pretty quick,” she said.Previous coverage: Al's Family Farms celebrates comeback from tornado damage Al’s Family Farms celebrates comeback from tornado damage Now restored, the barn stands as a symbol of resilience and the farm’s enduring 48-year legacy in St. Lucie County.“We’ve got a lot of ideas for things we can do to make this place even better because we’re planning on being here for a long time,” Matthew Schorner said.Al’s Family Farms is once again open to the public, welcoming back customers with citrus, fresh juice and traditions rooted deep in the community.Portions of this story were assisted by artificial intelligence tools and reviewed by a WPTV journalists to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to editorial standards.","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/were-still-here-als-family-farms-re-opens-after-tornado-destruction"
"FAU professor placed on leave for Charlie Kirk comments files federal lawsuit","NewsEducation FAU professor placed on leave for comments about Charlie Kirk assassination files federal lawsuit On Wednesday, Dr. Cole’s legal team filed an 18-page federal lawsuit against FAU and 6 top officials Caleb Holder/WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated It’s been eight weeks since three Florida Atlantic University professors were placed on paid administrative leave following social media posts about Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Now, one of those professors is suing the university, alleging violations of his First Amendment rights. WATCH: Lawsuit argues FAU's actions were 'retaliatory' FAU professor placed on leave for Charlie Kirk comments files federal lawsuit We were first to report when conservative-leaning professor Dr. Rebel Cole became the second FAU faculty member placed on leave. Cole, a tenured professor of finance, was removed from the classroom for posts on X related to Kirk’s death. He remains barred from teaching or entering campus until further notice.On Wednesday, Dr. Cole’s legal team filed an 18-page federal lawsuit against Florida Atlantic University and six top officials:University President Adam HasnerInterim Provost Russ IvyAssociate Provost Stephen EngleChair of the Dept. of Finance Anita PennathurDonald NeubaumChee OstinelliThe complaint demands a jury trial and seeks compensation for damages, legal fees, and additional relief.According to the lawsuit, FAU’s actions were “retaliatory,” targeting Cole because he “chose to confront people on social media who celebrated the murder of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.” Education FAU hired GOP-connected firm to investigate professors over Kirk comments Ethan Stein The posts at the center of the controversy show Cole responding to someone using a megaphone in what the lawsuit describes as a “celebration” of Kirk’s murder. Cole replied in part: “This is NOT free speech. It is inciting a riot... someone should shut his mouth."" When another user challenged him, Cole responded: “Be very afraid. We are going to hunt you down. We are going to identify you. Then we are going to make you radioactive to polite society. And we will make you both unemployed and unemployable.” Dr. Cole is one of three FAU professors placed on leave. While Cole’s posts defended Kirk, the other two professors’ posts came from the opposite side of the political spectrum. The lawsuit argues that FAU targeted Cole in part “to give Defendants a safe harbor to claim that they also acted against a professor with conservative views.” Education EXCLUSIVE: FAU professor placed on leave over Kirk posts speaks to WPTV Michael Hoffman Both Dr. Cole and FAU declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.Dr. Karen Leader, the first professor placed on leave, told WPTV that although she disagrees with Cole’s comments, she commends him for fighting for First Amendment rights. Leader previously stated in an exclusive September interview that she is also considering legal action but has not yet decided whether to file.Dr. Cole is represented by Edward H.

"'Needed a miracle': Local nonprofit helps struggling family become homeowners","NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin County Family Promise of Martin County helps family facing eviction become homeowners For one Martin County father, a sudden medical crisis pushed his family to the brink of homelessness — until a local nonprofit stepped in Family Promise of Martin County By: Meghan McRoberts Posted MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — As the cost of living continues to surge across South Florida, many longtime residents are finding it harder than ever to stay afloat. For one Martin County father, a sudden medical crisis pushed his family to the brink of homelessness — until a local nonprofit stepped in. WATCH: Brooker says everything changed when his wife’s health took a turn Family Promise of Martin County helps family facing eviction become homeowners Now, he’s celebrating something he once thought was impossible: owning his first home.New homes are frequently being built across the Treasure Coast, but prices are outpacing what many families can afford.“I was paying $2,200 a month for a 3-bedroom, 2-bath crap duplex wood frame falling apart thing,” said John Brooker, who lives in Martin County with his wife and three children. Brooker says the family had always managed to get by. “We were getting by okay, but you know, my wife had worked 34 years for the same bank,” Brooker said. Everything changed when his wife’s health took a turn, and she ultimately lost her job. Overnight, the family went from two incomes to one. “We were renters and rents were going up. It snowballed and next thing you know we’re upside down $12,000-$15,000 in credit card debt in just like six months,” Brooker said.Then came the eviction notice. “To be a father, and have three kids in your house and you’re trying not to tell them how bad things are knowing you’re going to be evicted any day,” Brooker said.Brooker sought help with food and bills but couldn’t find enough support to catch up.“I needed something. I needed a miracle. That’s what I got,” Brooker said.That “miracle,” he says, came from Family Promise of Martin County.“She was like, 'Yes we can help you'. I almost fainted.,” Brooker said.The nonprofit specializes in keeping families together during housing crises — something Executive Director Madeleine Bozone says sets them apart.“Our promise in family promise is keeping the family together. So in certain shelters they won’t take a parent if they have a child that’s a male age 12 or older... We’ll take the whole family and keep them together.”The organization provided the family with temporary housing at a very low rate, giving them a chance to stabilize and start saving again.In just nine months, Brooker was back on his feet — and for the first time in his life, a homeowner.“Now I have my own home that I only pay $1,400 a month for.”When asked what that moment felt like:“Is this your first time owning a home? asked WPTV. ""Yes. Amazing, amazing. Yea. How does it feel? Liberating,"" Brooker said. He says every day still feels surreal.“I pull in the driveway and I walk up to the house and I smile because this is mine. I did it. This belongs to me.”Bozone says Brooker’s story is one of success, but the demand for help continues to grow as rent prices keep rising faster than local wages.“There are families that really are, they’re just struggling and they can’t figure out why is it that I’m working full time, working another part-time job, or they do have two household incomes with two wage earners and still aren’t able to make it. It’s something we really have to solve in Martin County. It’s a problem for sure,” Bozone said. HOW TO HELPFamily Promise of Martin County relies heavily on community donations. This weekend, the organization is hosting its annual fundraiser — the Martin County Bed Races in downtown Stuart — where teams decorate twin beds and race them down Flagler Avenue. Attendees can cheer on the racers and make donations to support families facing homelessness.The event is Nov. 15 at 600 SE Flagler Avenue in Stuart, near Sailfish Ballpark, beginning at 10 a.m. More information here.","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-martin-county/family-promise-of-martin-county-helps-family-facing-eviction-become-homeowners"

WATCH: Is HOA-related crime on the rise in Florida? Legislator renews calls to abolish HOAs following deadly dispute The dramatic scene unfolded as officers stormed the residence, with authorities revealing the HOA was actively seeking to evict Maraio from the community.""Unfortunately it happens a lot more often than one would think,"" said Eric Perez, an HOA attorney with Perez Mayoral Law in Coral Gables. Perez, whose firm represents thousands of homeowners, says HOA violence isn't rare — it's routine.

The cases involved former employees and individuals seeking medical care or other services at the clinic.""We have hundreds of physicians in Indian River County. Rarely do we have anybody come in and make a complaint against a physician,"" Flowers said during a news conference on Friday. ""For us to have somebody who has eight prior cases and the ninth one that just happened, is very problematic.

"Can drones stop another school shooting in Florida?","NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates Inside the Texas start-up bringing drones to Florida schools to stop school shootings Florida to become first state to fund pilot program Florida is set to become among the first states in the country to test cutting-edge drone technology designed to stop school shooters before they can kill. By: Katie LaGrone Posted FLORIDA — Florida is set to become among the first states in the country to test cutting-edge drone technology designed to stop school shooters before they can kill. The state has approved $557,000 for a pilot program three school districts, marking a significant shift in how schools might respond to active shooter situations.The technology, developed by Campus Guardian Angel, a Texas-based start-up, uses professional drone pilots operating from a command center in Austin, Texas. The drones would be deployed within seconds of a school shooting alert. The system aims to distract, disorient or physically stop a shooter while buying crucial time for first responders. Watch full report from Katie LaGrone Inside the TX start-up bringing drones to Florida schools to stop school shootings ""Most of the death happens in the first two minutes,"" said Justin Marston, a cyber security expert and CEOP Campus Guardian Angel. ""So the challenge was, how do you get something that's instantaneous but elite and still affordable?""Marston said he came up with the idea after observing the effectiveness of small drones against armed individuals in Ukraine, combined with analyzing mass shootings like those at Parkland and Uvalde.“We feel in both of those, we could have engaged the shooter ahead of time,” he told Investigative Reporter Katie LaGrone.LaGrone recently visited the company’s headquarters in Austin. Military-Style command center The operation runs from what looks like a U.S. military command center, complete with multiple screens and a team of 11 specialists. Former Navy SEAL Bill King, who piloted Predator drones for the U.S. military overseas, is the co-founder of the company and is helping to lead drone operations.""We are leaning so far forward that only one pilot can go to the bathroom at a time,"" King said. ""Because if we're going to make a decision in five seconds.""The command center is set up to maintain a constant state of readiness with four pilots positioned on either side of the room and a commander in the center coordinating operations.A threat track will also be in position along with liaisons whose focus will be communication with locals on the ground, according to King. How the technology works Schools would be equipped with dozens of drones stored in strategic locations around campus. When an alert is triggered, encrypted drones designed for low delay are deployed within seconds by professional pilots controlling the devices remotely from Austin.The company’s anticipated timeline for engaging a shooter is precise: within five seconds, the drones are deployed; within 15 seconds, they've engaged the shooter; and within one minute, they've taken the shooter down.""We have some that are dedicated to window breaking. So, we can essentially pick which drone we want to use and go after them,"" said Mason Lively, a 25-year-old professional drone pilot and world champion drone racer recruited for the program.For Lively, joining Campus Guardian Angel was personal. He graduated high school in 2018 and grew up in Melbourne, Florida, with connections to the Parkland community.""I had friends of friends that went to Parkland, so I was very aware of that, and very aware of what happened there and then, when they talked about what they were going to do here, that's a big reason why I came up,"" Lively said.Despite the high-stakes nature of the work, Lively said he is ready and relies on preparation and constant training to manage his nerves about going into action once the program is up and running in schools.“I feel like once we’re in the scenario, we’re going to be ready to go.The nerves will disappear, and it will be just like any other event that we do,” he said. ‘Non-lethal distractors’ The drones are designed to employ various non-lethal distraction methods, from flashing lights and loud sirens to pellet bangs. If necessary, the pilots can physically engage a shooter by flying the drone into the shooter.In a demonstration on site, the pilot knocked down a dummy after it was struck head on.“It’s like a baseball bat, so it will hurt but not be lethal,” explained Lively.Other drones are designed to smash windows to further create a distraction.""If we can get a shooter to do anything besides shoot people, we're winning,"" King said. ""If you're shooting at the drone, great. We love that if you're trying to hit the drone with a broomstick, great.

"Broken meters and rate increases continue to frustrate those visiting downtown","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyDelray Beach Delray Beach parking pilot program draws criticism over meters and rate increases Employees and residents say the new program is taking time to get used to WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Delray Beach’s new paid parking rates and time limits in the downtown core continue to frustrate residents, visitors, and business owners, who say the rollout has been confusing and inconsistent. The changes, part of a pilot program that began Oct. 1, raised prices in garages and surface lots and introduced new limits on how long drivers can stay. WATCH: Frustrations mount over paid parking pilot program Delray Beach parking pilot program draws criticism over meters and rate increases For visitor John Durr, simply paying to park became its own challenge. “It’s confusing, I don’t want to say it could be easier, but it’s not so easy for me right now,” he said after struggling with a meter. Earlier, he tried to use a kiosk that displayed an error message. “The machine here is out of paper over here, I couldn’t get it to work,"" he said. Inside Silverball Retro Arcade, general manager Vincent Messera said his customers have been voicing similar frustrations. Employees who work downtown can pay $10 a month for parking permits, but he says that is not sitting well with staff. “It’s taking some time for employees and guests to get used to—they’re so used to free parking for how many years. I think awareness needs to increase so people know and they don’t get ticketed,” he said. WPTV A sign inside Silverball Retro Arcade in downtown Delray Beach. Longtime Delray Beach resident Rick Reeder criticized the city for what he sees as poor maintenance of the meters and a lack of preparation. “The cost of the parking is reasonable but when they give you a machine that begins the conversation with you by telling you the printer has no paper so you can’t get a receipt—that is miserable management of the parking facility system.” The city’s Public Works Department oversees the meters and upkeep. The issue of increased rates and public frustration was raised at a recent commission meeting, but city leaders agreed to keep the new structure in place until the pilot program ends in April. Delray Beach Parking price hike has local businesses worried about community impact Vannia Joseph In October, Mayor Tom Carney told WPTV reporter Joel Lopez, the city will be evaluating usage data before making any long-term decisions. “The city needs the revenues, the residents need to make sure their assets are being monetized properly,” he said. For those who rely on downtown parking, the hope is that the system becomes easier to navigate in the meantime. As Reeder put it, “If we’re gonna have these laws to collect these parking fees—which are reasonable, I don’t have a problem with that—then manage your system to facilitate it being done in a manner that’s professional and reflects well on the city.”","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/delray-beach/delray-beach-parking-pilot-program-draws-criticism-over-meters-and-rate-increases"
