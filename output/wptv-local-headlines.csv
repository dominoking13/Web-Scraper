"Local mother exonerated after child sex crimes arrest","NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates Boca Raton mother exonerated after child sex crimes arrest in March 2024 Walquiria Cassini was just weeks from trial when Palm Beach County prosecutors dismissed all charges, citing new evidence Danielle Leonard, WPTV Walquiria Cassini becomes emotional during an exclusive interview with WPTV after being cleared of child sex abuse charges. The Boca Raton mother spent two years fighting allegations that prosecutors dismissed citing new evidence just weeks before her trial was set to begin. By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A Boca Raton mother accused of child sex crimes has been cleared of all charges after prosecutors dismissed the case, citing new evidence that emerged just two weeks before her trial was set to begin.Walquiria Cassini, 40, was arrested in March 2024 along with her fiancé, Ryan Londono, and her then-20-year-old son Matthew. WATCH BELOW: Local mother exonerated after child sex crimes arrest Mother exonerated after child sex crimes arrest in 2024 They faced allegations of sexually abusing Cassini's children and livestreaming the abuse for financial gain over five years.The Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office filed a dismissal document Thursday, stating ""new information brought to the state's attention"" led to the decision to drop all charges.""I love my children, I would never, ever hurt them. That did not happen in my home. I am innocent,"" Cassini said in an exclusive one-on-one interview with WPTV. Case began during custody dispute Cassini and her attorneys, Mac Kenzie Sacks and Matthew Goldberger of South Florida Justice, say the sexual abuse allegations stemmed from a bitter custody dispute over Thanksgiving 2023. Cassini said the father of her two children never returned them after the holiday, despite promising to do so.Text messages WPTV obtained show Cassini messaging her ex-husband dozens of times on Nov. 26, asking where her children were and threatening to call the police. Her messages went unanswered until the next day, when she finally called 911.Body camera footage from Nov. 27 showed Marion County deputies responding to her ex's home in Ocala after he reported the allegations. However, hours later, Palm Beach County deputies questioned his claims.""It's possible that the kids are just lying about this because they want to stay with dad, because dad hasn't witnessed any of this,"" a Marion County deputy told Palm Beach County deputies in body camera footage. ""This was reported to him two days ago, but he didn't call us until tonight. He's more concerned with keeping his kids than he is with the actual allegations."" Detective under investigation The arresting Palm Beach County sheriff's detective, in the arrest affidavit, claimed to have found sex toys, suspicious payments and an adult website account tied to Cassini's IP address, with files deleted the day after the investigation began.In court motions, Cassini's attorneys accused the detective of fabricating evidence, saying the website never had accounts linked to Cassini, the sex toys were unrelated, and the FBI found no child exploitation material on any of her 56 devices.""The sensational probable cause affidavit that was authored was authored to generate headlines, not to reflect facts or evidence,"" Sacks said. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office confirmed the detective is now the subject of an internal affairs investigation.Cassini's attorneys also noted that the children and their father refused medical examinations. ""We really feel like they are victims here of manipulation,"" said Goldberger. Moving forward without her children After reviewing digital evidence, depositions and witnesses, prosecutors said the state ""no longer has a good faith basis to proceed.""""Relieved, happy obviously, but I'm also a little sad too, because you think about this day forever,"" Cassini said, breaking down during the interview. ""I kept imagining myself in a courtroom, and then they give me the not guilty, my kids would come. But that's not what happens here.""Cassini still doesn't have custody of her children, who remain with their father. She lost her job, friends and reputation during the two-year ordeal.""Obviously, I want my story told. I know there's going to be people that probably don't believe it,"" Cassini said. ""That part is tough, but I'm willing to share the story if it helps somebody else in the future and prevents this from happening to anybody.""Cassini is now preparing for a legal battle to reunite with her children. Attempts to reach the children's father for comment were unsuccessful.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

The state's insurer of last resort continues its aggressive depopulation efforts as it works to reduce financial exposure for Florida taxpayers.WATCH BELOW: Citizens Insurance moves 350K Florida policies to private insurers Citizens Insurance moves 350K Florida policies to private insurers Ramsay MacLeod, a Lake Worth Beach homeowner, received her first takeout notice in April from Slide Insurance. The transition comes with a significant financial impact for the fixed-income resident.""I received the final notice in April. There was an interest from Slide (Insurance),"" MacLeod said. ""And then there was another one, it's like, this is the demand, you're being dropped. You are going with Slide.""The takeout offer is capped at no more than a 20% increase over her current Citizens premium, but the financial burden remains substantial.""I'm on a budget, a fixed income, and for me to get hit with an increase that I have to come up with almost $4,000 by February of next year just to still have insurance coverage. That's a big blow for me,"" MacLeod said.The higher costs for homeowners translate to reduced financial exposure for Citizens and Florida residents who ultimately back the state insurer.

"Why business owners here are pushing for a pedestrian-only area","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach Business owners on Clematis Street in downtown West Palm Beach push for a pedestrian-only area amid struggles 'I think the rents in this area are very high, and we don't have enough traffic,' business owner Michele Holmes says WPTV For Lease sign on building along Clematis Street in downtown West Palm Beach on Oct. 31, 2025 By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A group of businesses on Clematis Street said they are pushing West Palm Beach to create more pedestrian-only streets.These businesses, specifically located on the 500 block of the city's historic main street, are making the argument to city leaders after an increase in turnover on the strip. WPTV has noticed an increase in empty storefronts and ""for lease signs"" along Clematis Street compared to a few months ago.WATCH BELOW: Business owners along Clematis St. push for pedestrian-only area Clematis Street business owners push for pedestrian-friendly zone Michele Holmes, who owns a mini market selling everything from groceries to mosquito repellent wipes, is among the business owners advocating for the change. She said high rents in the area, along with other costs, like insurance, mean she has to relocate to a different spot on the same block to keep her doors open.""We don't see enough families,"" Holmes said about the current state of the area. ""It just starts to be cumbersome, you know, where your profits are lower than what you need to survive.""She said businesses see a 30% to 35% increase in sales when the city closes down the 500 block for various events.A city-commissioned consultant recently created a report examining ways to improve walkability and bike access along the downtown waterfront area. However, those recommendations focused primarily on areas closer to the waterfront rather than Clematis Street.Read the full consultant report below:WPTV asked the city if it had any concerns about businesses in the downtown area. A city spokesperson said they are looking at ways to promote businesses across the city.""We are interested in the viability of businesses throughout our City,"" the spokesperson said. ""Each day, our economic development team researches ways to promote the health of businesses throughout the City.""The spokesperson also said it did not have plans to create additional pedestrian-only areas in the Clematis Waterfront District.WPTV also noticed on Friday several shops and restaurants have opened along Clematis Street over the last six months, like Skinny Louie and Crema Gourmet Espresso Bar. There are also locations under construction that have taken years, like Pubbelly Sushi and Bacon Bitch, the latter of which eventually went out of business.One of those business trying to move into Clematis Street is Arya Tea Bar, which said it would open in Fall 2025. However, the tea store is still not open as of November. Its owner posted a video on Instagram asking people to do their ""permit rain dance"" when discussing a pause in construction that lasted a few weeks.""This is something that I was warned about and tried to do everything I could in advance to make sure we were moving forward,"" said Sophie DeWaal. ""But, the reality is it's just the system. ... Basically, you send it in and it takes five days for somebody to look at it, who isn’t the person who needs to review it, and then that person that routes it to the people who need to review it.""When WPTV reached out to DeWaal, who left a career on Wall Street to start the company in West Palm Beach, she said she had a pretty smooth time getting permits and called the city ""incredibly"" helpful. She also said the city gave her a grant to assist with her build-out.""I believe I've posted about one 3-week delay related to permits, but that's not bad at all in the scheme of things, and we will be opening quite close to my original plan,"" wrote DeWaal.A city spokesperson said it doesn't believe it has a permit problem stopping businesses from thriving in the downtown area.""West Palm Beach is known for being one of the governmental entities in Palm Beach County that processes permits the fastest,"" said the spokesperson.

"Florida school bus camera tickets still frustrating drivers a year later","NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates School bus camera tickets still causing frustration for some Florida drivers waiting to appeal Two drivers who waited a year to challenge their school bus camera fines share updates on their cases A year after we were first to discover drivers were getting ticketed for passing a school bus but had couldn’t challenge their fines, two of the original drivers we spoke with are sharing updates. By: Katie LaGrone Posted and last updated FLORIDA — A few days ago, Tampa resident Karen Coring emailed us. She's one of the original drivers we spoke with nearly one year ago who believed she was wrongly ticketed for passing a school bus while it was stopped for kids.In her email, Coring described having an ""important development"" about her case. Coring received the ticket a year ago and has been waiting all this time just to challenge it.""I got a letter stating I already had a hearing date that I missed,"" Coring told us.Coring said she was never notified of a hearing.""I had no idea. I haven't received any letters about a hearing!""For Coring, this was a big deal. As a result, her original $225 fine will now cost her $270, according to a letter she received indicating that she was being held liable for the fine. Coring’s update is just the latest from her year-long saga with Florida’s new school bus camera program. The cameras started rolling on drivers last year in several Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, Polk, and Hillsborough County, where Coring lives.In 2023, lawmakers approved a bill that allows Florida school districts to equip its buses with cameras. The intent of the legislation was to increase student safety around school bus stops by catching drivers who illegally pass a school bus while it's stopped for students.The problem was drivers around the state swiftly started complaining that they were being unfairly fined.Coring was one of the first drivers Investigative Reporter Katie LaGrone and Photojournalist Matthew Apthorp spoke with.""I didn't illegally pass the school bus,"" Coring told us back in February.Lars Larsen, a Tampa dad with five young kids, also believed he was wrongly ticketed. Video from both Coring and Larsen’s citations raises questions about whether either or both drivers had already passed the front of the school bus by the time the bus’s stop arm started to deploy.After LaGrone began investigating their complaints, she discovered that drivers ticketed by these cameras had no way to challenge their violations. Turns out, while the camera vendor and school districts started rolling on drivers, the process for drivers to contest their tickets was never set up.As a result of our findings, lawmaker quietly adjusted the law to ensure people could properly challenge their fines.Drivers fumed.""That's just obnoxious,"" Larson told us when we revealed the lack of due process in place.""100% it’s a money grab,"" he said.Many others felt the same. Cleo Davis in Polk County called the camera program, ""strong arm robbery,"" after he was captured passing a school bus right before train tracks. Davis said no children ever got off the bus, and he thought the bus had stopped because they were required to stop at the train tracks.Raising more questions, LaGrone found the cameras are generating a ton of cash. In Miami-Dade and Broward counties alone, paid violations generated more than $40 million in just a matter of months. The for-profit camera vendor, BusPatrol, keeps 70% of every paid fine.""That sticker shock, that 70% sounds like a salacious number, but what people don't realize is that BusPatrol is fronting all of the capital to the tune of millions of dollars,"" said Steve Randazzo of BusPatrol.Now nearly a year later, after our investigation helped inspire lawmakers to change the law, administrative law judges are conducting appeal hearings through zoom. Hillsborough County started holding hearings in August. Other counties are still working to implement its own appeals processes.Of more than 1,100 appeal hearings held in Hillsborough, nearly 90% have ended with the judge upholding the violation, according to data from the Hillsborough County school district provided by BusPatrol.While Coring said she was never notified about her own hearing, Larson had a different outcome.""I received a notice that my case was dismissed, and I received that notice by mail two days before my court date,"" Larsen said.Larsen said there was no reason stated in his letter explaining his sudden dismissal. According to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office, which reviews citations before they’re sent out, Larsen’s dismissal stemmed from an “administrative review.”“I'll take that as they're admitting guilt on their own behalf, or their system kind of failed after reviewing it a second time, I guess,” Larsen said.According to BusPatrol, drivers who miss their scheduled appeal hearing can get an additional hearing. Coring has already submitted information for another appeal.But what happened to Coring and Larsen continues to illustrate what has been the main issue with these cameras all along—a hastily rolled out camera program pitched to keep students safe but still leaving drivers confused, frustrated, and questioning who's really benefiting?""It's a mess, it's confusion,"" Coring said.""I was actually looking forward to the Zoom call,"" Larsen said. ""It's like you've strung me out this long and you're picking a fight with somebody who didn't do anything wrong. I was ready to make a mockery of them,"" he said.In Miami-Dade County, the sheriff suspended its school bus camera program over various issues, including the driver’s lack of due process. Polk County has also suspended its bus cameras until an appeal process is in place.

"Cyclists speak up for safer roads at Boca Raton town hall","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoca Raton Boca Raton addresses e-bike and electric scooter safety concerns at town hall WPTV requested data from Boca Raton police officials, who said there have been 4 e-bike-related crashes since April 2025 WPTV By: Zitlali Solache Posted BOCA RATON, Fla. — The city of Boca Raton is setting the record straight on rules of the road when it comes to e-bikes, electric scooters and other devices.During Thursday’s micro-mobility safety town hall, residents took their concerns straight to city officials. WATCH: Cyclists say they don't feel safe on Boca Raton roads Cyclists speak up for safer roads at Boca Raton town hall Ginger Phillips was one of several who attended, and said has seen the world on her bicycle.“I’ve ridden all over the world and I’ve been riding for decades,” said Phillips. “But in Boca Raton, I ride my bicycle on the sidewalk. First place in the world I’ve ever ridden on a sidewalk.” Phillips and others said the roads just don’t feel safe anymore and they’re pushing for changes on roadways. They add it’s a mix of unfollowed rules and lacking infrastructure that brought them to the town hall.“As these devices become more common, and they have, it’s essential that we all understand how to use them safely,” said Deputy Mayor Fran Nachlas. Layne Hollander rides the 11-mile El Rio trail daily but said it can feel dangerous.“The reason why we showed up today is because we’re a little saddened by when we cross the intersection, we don’t feel quite as safe,” said Hollander. Boca Raton 'IT SCARES ME': Electric bike safety concerns grow in Boca Raton Zitlali Solache Riders said it’s not just other cyclists; it’s reckless drivers and speeding that add to the risk. They’re calling for more enforcement and safety upgrades to roadways. “We have accidents all the time and they’re really not accidents, they are really caused by the high speed of cars,” said Phillips. “Right now, we just don’t have the infrastructure that people feel confident to be on the road with cars.”WPTV requested data from Boca Raton police officials, who said there have been four e-bike related crashes since April 2025.
