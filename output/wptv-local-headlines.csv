        ST. LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. — A man charged with killing a woman and their unborn child in St. Lucie County seven years ago was found guilty Friday.It took the jury only about an hour to find Jose Antonio Soto-Escalera of Port St. Lucie guilty of two counts of first-degree murder.
    
        Man arrested for murder of pregnant St. Lucie County woman: Sheriff
    
    
    
        
    
    

In August 2018, the body of Tania Wise, 23, of Port St. Lucie, was found face down in a ditch off a rural road in northern St. Lucie County.Soto-Escalera, who was 41 years old at the time of the killing, was arrested 28 days after Wise's body was discovered.During the week-long trial, the jury was shown autopsy photos where Wise suffered trauma to her head and throat.Prosecutors contended Soto-Escalera killed Wise so his wife would not find out that he and the victim were involved in a relationship.DNA evidence confirmed Soto-Escalera was the unborn baby's father.The state is also seeking the death penalty in the case. The jury will reconvene on Wednesday for the sentencing phase.

        ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — A Florida federal judge on Friday tossed out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times.U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that Trump's lawsuit was overly long and was full of ""tedious and burdensome"" language that had no bearing on the legal case.
    
        Trump floats revoking licenses for networks critical of him
    
    
    
        
    
    

""A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally,"" Merryday wrote in a four-page order. ""This action will begin, will continue, and will end in accord with the rules of procedure and in a professional and dignified manner.""The judge ruled that Trump has 28 days to file an amended complaint that should not exceed 40 pages in length.The lawsuit named a book and an article written by Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig that focuses on Trump’s finances and his pre-presidency starring role in television's ""The Apprentice.""Trump said in the lawsuit that they ""maliciously peddled the fact-free narrative"" that television producer Mark Burnett turned Trump into a celebrity — ""even though at and prior to the time of publications defendants knew that President Trump was already a mega-celebrity and an enormous success in business.""The lawsuit also attacked claims the reporters made about Trump's early business dealings and his father, Fred.Trump also cited an article by Peter Baker last Oct. 20 headlined ""For Trump, a Lifetime of Scandals Heads Toward a Moment of Judgment.""

        PINECREST, Fla. — Law enforcement officers in South Florida have to always be prepared for the unexpected when they clock in each day.That was the case for an officer with the Pinecrest Police Department and a deputy with the Miami-Dade Sheriff's Office who encountered a slithery surprise this week.
    
        Python hotspot in rural Palm Beach County, study says
    
    
    
        
    
    

According to a post on the police department's Facebook page, Sgt. Carlos Atola and a sheriff's deputy captured a massive Burmese python at the intersection of U.S. 1 and Southwest 98th Street.The police department said the big reptile measured 14 feet!The picture posted to Facebook showed the officer and deputy holding the python outside a tire shop where the snake was caught.Pinecrest is about 11 miles southwest of the city of Miami, so the big snake was found in an area not exactly considered rural!""This invasive species poses a serious threat to Florida's native wildlife, and thanks to quick action, it's one less slithering danger on our roads and in our community,"" the police department posted on Facebook.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said that since the year 2000, more than 23,000 wild Burmese pythons have been removed from the state and reported to the FWC.

        ATLANTIS, FL — Making it to 105 is a big deal – but according to Dr. Theodore Gerson's family, what's even more impressive is everything he's accomplished since calling Palm Beach County home back in the 1950s.WATCH BELOW: 'I don't have the drive to get up at this age, but I get up,' Dr. Theodore Gerson tells WPTV's Victor Jorges
    
        Doctor, 105, shares his daily philosophy for a life well-lived
    
    
    
        
    
    

Our cameras were rolling as this local hero received quite the surprise: his loved ones decorated his entire front yard to celebrate this incredible milestone birthday.
    
        
    
    

""Happy 105th Theodore!"" read the colorful signs adorning his property.Inside his home, WPTV reporter Victor Jorges asked Gerson the question everyone wants answered: What's his secret to making it 105 years?""I wish I knew,” he said. “I'd never dreamed that I would live this long.""But all jokes aside, Gerson did share his daily philosophy – the mindset that gets him out of bed each morning after doing so for more than a century.""I don't have the drive to get up at this age, but I get up, because I know there's daylight coming through the window, and I know it isn't healthy to lie in bed all day long,"" he said.
    
        
    
    

Gerson has built quite the legacy here in Palm Beach County. His family estimates that during his 41 years as a practicing physician, he helped deliver more than 7,000 babies.""It wasn't a normal life,"" he said. ""I almost never had a night's sleep uninterrupted. If I did, I woke up thinking there must be something wrong with the phone.""
    
        
    
    

But ask Gerson about his biggest accomplishment, and he won't mention the countless deliveries or medical procedures. Instead, he focuses on something more personal – the relationships he built with thousands of families over the decades.""What I'm proud of is the great number of people that I had as patients who felt that I had done a good job,"" he said. ""It was something I never dreamt I'd ever feel, but it was a warm feeling. It was like having a giant family in one town.""

        MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — The Martin County Sheriff’s Office said it is actively investigating a series of puppy and kitten adoption scams circulating on Facebook and other online platforms.Deputies said they have identified at least six victims who paid deposits for animals that were never delivered.According to detectives, Facebook pages advertising “(breed) puppies/kittens for rehoming and adoption"" are created using photos from legitimate breeders, or public profiles, to make the pages appear real. The accounts are usually new and often post multiple times on the same date, deputies said,  and victims are asked to send money up front, then pressured with additional “fees” for transport, boarding, or veterinary care.In some cases, they threaten that the animal will be euthanized if the money is not sent.
    
    



The Martin County Sheriff’s Office advises those interested in buying or adopting an animal to do the following:• Research breeders, shelters, or rescue groups thoroughly before sending money.• Be cautious of new social media pages with little activity or identical posting dates.• Because a pet is such a large investment, always ask to see the animal in person and meet the breeder before making any payments. If the seller refuses or makes excuses, consider it a red flag and do not move forward.• Never send payment through gift cards, wire transfers, or peer-to-peer apps to people you do not know.

        PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — An 18-year-old is facing felony charges after making bomb threats to four South Florida schools in December 2024.Jayden Bullard, 18, is being charged with two counts of making a false report of a bomb and two counts of disrupting a school function for his threats made to a school in Palm Beach County. On Dec. 2, 2024, Boca Raton High School was placed in Code Red for two and a half hours after an anonymous phone call stating there was a bomb in the bathroom. The caller, later identified as Bullard, also said he had an AR-15 rifle, threatened to kill someone and would shoot responding police officers. During the investigation, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO) learned that Miami-Dade School Police had experienced two to three false bomb reports that day with similar threats. In April 2025, authorities traced the threats to a residence in Leesburg, Florida. The Leesburg Police Department seized electronic devices from the home and shared the findings with PBSO, linking the case to the December threats. Investigators later identified Bullard as a suspect.Detectives said Bullard, who was 17 at the time, admitted to making the false threats to Boca Raton High and three Miami-Dade schools, none of which he had attended. He told investigators he was on Discord with multiple people coaching him on what to say. Messages from Dec. 2 showed the group planning the calls and later mocking media coverage of the police response.Bullard is scheduled to make his first appearance in Palm Beach County on Friday, and appeared in front of a judge in Miami in July.

        PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — In her first TV interview since being placed on administrative leave, FAU Professor Dr. Karen Leader is breaking her silence — in an exclusive sit down with WPTV’s Michael Hoffman.Leader was the first FAU professor to face backlash for sharing posts on X after the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Since then, two other professors at the school have also been put on leave for their social media posts in the wake of Kirk’s assassination. WATCH: Dr. Karen Leader speaks to WPTV

Dr. Leader, an associate professor of art history, confirmed to Hoffman she was the professor referenced in the university’s announcement. The school said in part, “Our focus remains on our academic community’s responsibility to promote civil discourse, conduct healthy debate, and treat one another with respect.”“I wanted to have a chance to speak to my community and have them see what I'm trying to say,” Leader said. Leader said she has received death threats and had her home and work addresses leaked online. She told Hoffman this was the first time she left her home in nearly a week. “I don't know if I'll go right back home after this and then stay there for another five days,” she said.WATCH: 'That's what so striking to me, the violence'

Leader showed Hoffman the posts she shared on X that called Kirk “racist, transphobic, homophobic and more.” In those posts, she added the words, “This was Charlie Kirk.”She said she has since deleted a post alleging Kirk used a racial slur after finding it was not true, but left the other posts up, saying she wanted to start a discourse about what she called the “whitewashing of a controversial figure.” “What I did is posted or reposted a lot of content that offered proof that he had said vile things and targeted populations and demonstrated his bigotry, and I was mostly reposting evidence,” Leader said. Hoffman asked how she she responds to people saying the posts were out context.“Yeah. I would say that if you have a preponderance of evidence, one thing taken out of context does not cancel out the preponderance of evidence. The concerted effort to present him as moderate, as uncontroversial, as just wanting to ask questions, just wanting to have conversations. That's not who he was.”WATCH: Dr. Leader says she is open to pursuing lawsuit to defend free speech

But the discipline from FAU does not appear to fall along partisan lines. Two other professors, Dr. Kate Polak and Dr. Rebel Cole, were also placed on leave for social media posts following Kirk’s assassination. One, Dr. Cole, was placed on leave for conservative leaning posts. Hoffman reached out to both for interviews. Dr. Cole declined, and Dr. Polak has not responded. Leader said she believes all three professors now share some common ground.“Constitutionally, we're on the same side, and so we have a collective responsibility to, you know, force our university to follow the law,” said Leader. And so if a lawsuit is the way we have to do that, I certainly would.” WATCH: Dr. Leader on Kirk and the public university system

Leader also expressed confidence she will return to the classroom, and left this message for students and the FAU community.“Last thing I want to say is to my students that I'm sorry,” said Leader. “To all my students past, present, to FAU alumni, to FAU parents, what's happening is devaluing their degree, and that's happening all over the state.” MORE WPTV COVERAGE:

        PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — In the wake of the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk, a firestorm of controversy has erupted across the political spectrum.Over the last week, WPTV has been tracking the fallout from inflammatory comments made by various educators, leading to significant backlash and discussions about accountability within the educational system.WATCH BELOW: 'I'm definitely not stepping down,' Edwin Ferguson tells WPTV's Joel Lopez
    
        School board member doubles down on Charlie Kirk comments
    
    
    
        
    
    

Now the focus is on Palm Beach County School Board member Edwin Ferguson, who is facing criticism for his remarks regarding Kirk.""I'm reaching out to everybody in the governor's office, every senator, congressman, I'm reaching out to all the people, because some of the people haven't seen this video yet, and everyone needs to know what's going on,"" Christian activist Willy Guardiola expressed his discontent, stating, ""I don't want an investigation, let's terminate this guy."" Guardiola argued that Ferguson, as a school board member, is a leader and represents a figure that many students look up to.He insists that Ferguson should adhere to the same standards as outlined in a letter from the Florida Department of Education, which threatens to remove teaching licenses from educators who publicly express ""vile"" views about Charlie Kirk.""Please be careful what you say and what you do, I don't care what party you're with,"" Guardiola warned.The statements were during Wednesday’s school board meeting; Ferguson cautioned his colleagues on the importance of their public speech and spoke on policy. ""I’m thinking unless you as a parent or you as a teacher feel bad because, I, as a teacher don’t miss a racist, a racist bigot at that, I don’t see how you are going to be at risk of losing your teaching certificate,"" Ferguson remarked.Ferguson's comments went further as he drew alarming comparisons between Kirk and Adolf Hitler.“When we talk about the Holocaust, I have yet to hear a person of the Jewish faith say, ‘I miss Adolf Hitler.’ He said a lot of toxic things that were very undermining to society at large, and we want to never forget that and we want to be better than that. The things that I have heard from this gentleman, Mr. Kirk, as it relates to the Black experience in this country are definitely things that would make me say I am sorry he passed away, but he did not use his voice effectively.” said Ferguson.This commentary quickly sparked controversy among Kirk's supporters.In an interview with WPTV's Joel Lopez, Ferguson was asked whether he was concerned about potential repercussions from his comments.""I'm not racist. I don't promote racist ideologies or anything like that so based on my understanding on the groundwork, the rules of the road I should say, no I'm not too worried about that,"" Ferguson responded. ""Whatever happens, will happen but my record since I've been on the board has been pretty exceptional and so I'll stand by that at all times. Being a racist is not a protected group of people.""Ferguson, who has been the District 7 board member for three years and plans to run for reelection, emphasized that while he does not condone Kirk’s assassination, he believes Kirk's remarks about Black people and his opposition to affirmative action, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives merit scrutiny.The West Palm Beach NAACP voiced their support for Ferguson in a statement:
    ""This is truly a tragedy for all involved; no one deserves to be murdered. We find all murders inexcusable. With that being said, a person's record, deceased or alive, speaks for itself. If you were a racist before you died, why would you be considered anything other than that after death? The means by which you die do not change who you are, what you represent, or the things you did while you lived. All that I know leads me to say Charlie Kirk was a racist."" - Alfred Fields, West Palm Beach NAACP.
    
    

Some have questioned Ferguson’s assertions about Kirk, particularly noting that he admitted he was unaware of Kirk prior to his assassination.When Lopez inquired if Ferguson had enough time to evaluate Kirk's message, Ferguson replied with the following:""Yes. If I look at five videos, and in those five videos you say things that seem to be biased to the point of being a racist or bigoted how many more videos do I need to see before I make a conclusion? If you're trying to elevate all people, no one can say Mr. Kirk did that and that's what I was getting at.""Guardiola countered Ferguson’s claims, arguing that Kirk's stance on DEI and affirmative action was not racist.""It's a merit system,"" he stated, adding that while Kirk didn't make too many appearances at Black colleges and universities, he welcomed discussions from people with all perspectives. ""He wanted the younger 18, 19-year-olds to have their own minds and say, 'Speak for yourself and talk and speak the truth.'""When asked what message he would send to Ferguson, Guardiola encouraged him to ""go back and watch Charlie Kirk and learn about him. I believe in free speech but when you're talking about hate speech without knowing the background, you can't be doing that.""However, Ferguson stood firm in his position.""Anybody who wants to have an honest dialogue then have an honest dialogue, but I won't be bullied by anyone as far as that goes,"" he said. ""I'm going to always advocate for our children here. I'm definitely not stepping down.""WPTV has reached out to the Florida Department of Education and the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis for further comments, and we await their response.

        FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Federal prosecutors are nearing the end of their case in the Ryan Routh trial.The jury on Thursday heard more information about makeshift guns prosecutors said Routh left in North Carolina before he traveled to Florida.WATCH BELOW: Sniper testifies Ryan Routh used military-style tactics

The weapons were found in a box that prosecutors said Routh left at a former employee's house months before the assassination attempt near President Donald Trump's golf course near West Palm Beach.On the stand, an ATF agent said investigators found in North Carolina various equipment that can be purchased at hardware stores like pipes, springs and clamps assembled into what it called make-shift firing mechanisms.Some of the seven different objects had space to hold a .50 caliber bullet.Prosecutors told the judge they found a manual about explosive devices in a trailer connected to Routh. However, they weren't allowed to introduce it to the jury because it wasn't related to the alleged assassination attempt.Prosecutors argued these attempts at creating a makeshift gun months before his arrest showed Routh's intent to commit violence months before his arrest.The jury on Thursday heard from a former sniper. He served as an expert witness for the prosecution to show Routh had the intent to create violence at Trump International Golf Club.The sniper said Routh's decisions are similar to the training techniques he learned in the military.This included going on operations at night, hiding in the bushes, using a scope, using a fence to help aim a weapon. The sniper testified that Routh's selection of Trump's golf course to conduct a shooting was similar to predicting movements for a target.Prosecutors also showed a list that included a green poncho, bug spray and diapers — all objects the sniper said are useful when hiding.Routh is representing himself in the trial.Routh's federal charges include:Attempted assassination of a major presidential candidatePossessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violenceAssaulting a federal officerFelon in possession of a firearm and ammunitionPossession of a firearm with an obliterated serial numberThe trial is expected to run for two or three weeks.Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a ""weapon of mass destruction,"" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch fuse.More of WPTV's coverage of Trump assassination attempt below:

Sanford said it’s gotten to the point where they are now talking about traveling to another state just to get the boost.“Yes, of course! I don't need to have my husband die on me from not being able to get a vaccine,” he said.Local pharmacies are also finding themselves in a COVID vaccine bind.The Health Matters Pharmacy in Tampa is waiting for its supply of COVID vaccines but isn’t sure it will ever arrive.“It’s very frustrating,” said Tiara Ross, a nurse practitioner there. “We want to get people vaccinated as early and as quickly as possible, but these barriers are going to make it a little bit more difficult.""The Food and Drug Administration recently approved updated COVID-19 vaccines, but with limits. The shots are currently limited to people at least 65 years old and those younger with certain health conditions and a prescription from their doctor.The restricted new rules have prompted a wave of confusion among medical professionals and pharmacies, with some of Florida’s most popular drugstores holding off on offering the shot.At Publix, the COVID-19 vaccine is “currently not available” in Florida, according to its website. Same with Walgreens, where the chain is waiting for the official recommendation from the CDC before offering the shot to Floridians. On Friday, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunizations will vote on who can get the COVID shot and if insurance will pay for it. The vaccine is the only agenda item for advisory council to discuss on Friday with a final vote expected in the afternoon.

The meeting is expected to be controversial given the influence of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., a staunch vaccine critic.While states can set their own rules, Florida’s Department of Health appears to be deliberately evasive about the topic. The agency has refused to provide any clarity despite weeks of our emails seeking answers.But in a podcast over the weekend, controversial Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, a vocal critic of the COVID-19 vaccine, announced his hope to shut it down in Florida. “The MRNA, the goal for that is not to be available to anyone because no one should be using that one,” he said during the podcast.Despite all the uncertainty, some Floridians have been successful in getting the shot.“I feel lucky,” said Mark Lebow of Port Charlotte. Lebow is over 65 years old and has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. He recently got the booster at a CVS in Venice but had to wait until he had a prescription from his doctor.“I think she wanted the prescription just because she's afraid of corporate backlash, or something like that,” he said.A vaccine that was once encouraged and available to all, now up in the air and fueling some concerns in Florida that it will become out of reach.

        WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — We've heard your concerns, and we've pressed lawmakers about the idea of eliminating property taxes in Florida.WPTV reporter Matt Sczesny listened to local leaders about the questions they had about how to fund essential services if property taxes come to an end.WATCH BELOW: Florida lawmaker proposes new revenue model to 'wipe out' property taxes
    
        Florida lawmaker proposes new revenue model to 'wipe out' property taxes
    
    
    
        
    
    

Next week, dozens of state representatives will sit down and meet to discuss the next steps regarding the proposal.Eliminating property taxes and replacing the revenue is the challenge, but state Rep. Ryan Chamberlin, R-Belleview, told WPTV that he has a plan.The first part of the plan, which he calls ""Freedom 1,2,3"", involves a rollback of property tax rates to numbers in 2023, putting revenue projections at $43 billion. Then he proposes a 5% transaction fee on real estate sales.Chamberlin said he wants to wipe out property taxes, reel in expected revenue and replace the dollars with a combination of fees and sales taxes, starting with an upfront payment when buying a home.""Right now, there currently is no sales tax when you buy a home; you just get billed the rest of your life,"" Chamberlin said. ""I brought that to a 5% transaction fee, which could be incorporated into your amount financed; it equates to a much, much smaller amount.""Another 5% sales tax would be imposed on travel-related transactions such as hotels and rideshare trips. The final part of the plan is a three-cent sales tax to benefit school districts.""The state is not going to spend it however they want; it is specific for schools and three cents will generate $20 billion,"" Chamberlin said.

    Ending property taxes? State lawmaker tells WPTV it's not 'fiscally responsible'

Chamberlin, who sits on a 37-member special committee on property taxes, said this is his plan only and does not involve Gov. Ron DeSantis or the committee co-chaired by state Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart.""There are a tremendous (number) of ideas coming forward, everything from either a monetary straightforward homestead exemption to a percentage associated with it,"" Overdorf told WPTV earlier this month.""I believe we can wipe out pretty much statewide property taxes with this plan if we come to a conclusion that we only want to deal with homestead exemption taxes,"" Chamberlin said.Chamberlin said he expects some opposition to his plan, but it will be discussed among lawmakers when the special committee on property taxes meets Monday.""I expect to be fully debated,"" Chamberlin said about his plan. ""If somebody comes up with better ideas, bring them on.""
