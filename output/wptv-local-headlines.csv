"West Palm Beach considers major waterfront upgrades","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach West Palm Beach considers major waterfront upgrades; lane reduction on Flagler sparks debate WPTV's Khalil McLean By: Michael Hoffman Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — West Palm Beach leaders are taking a close look at major changes to the downtown waterfront as part of the city’s new “Your Waterfront Your Way” plan — and one proposed idea is already getting strong reactions from residents.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: West Palm Beach considers major waterfront upgrades; lane reduction on Flagler sparks debate A newly released 89-page report calls the city’s waterfront underused, poorly designed, and in need of significant upgrades. Among the biggest recommendations: reducing Flagler Drive from four lanes to two to make room for expanded bike and pedestrian paths.The idea has residents split.Ed Goulart, who moved to West Palm Beach less than a year ago, says the waterfront already feels just right.“I always take pictures and send it to my family, make them a little bit jealous from back home,” he said.“I'm fairly new to West Palm, and I think it's perfect the way it is.”But the city argues the space could serve the community better. The plan outlines more shade, a redesigned seawall, new multi-use paths, and even the creation of a waterfront department and “waterfront czar.” Consultants say these changes could transform how people experience downtown.For longtime Flagler residents like Sherry Eckstein, the biggest concern is traffic.“The traffic on Flagler over the five years I've lived here has gotten progressively worse,” she said.“It's a gorgeous waterfront. I want people to be able to enjoy it, but not at the risk of terrible traffic and congestion.”Others, like Annie Barbiero, welcome the lane reduction and hope it calms what they see as out-of-control speeding.“Those speed limit signs as a joke, because everybody just speeds. It's wild. This is like the Wild West, really,” she said.“So, yeah, shrink it. Make people walk, make them take the circuit, make them take a water taxi, force them to get some exercise. Why does everybody have to drive everywhere?”Nothing in the plan is final. Commissioners and Mayor Keith James say they’re cautiously optimistic about improvements such as adding shade for events and establishing a waterfront czar. When — or if — construction begins remains unclear.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/west-palm-beach-considers-major-waterfront-upgrades-lane-reduction-on-flagler-sparks-debate"

I'm hungry.' What am I supposed to say?"" said Walker two weeks ago, not knowing how she was going to afford dinner for the holidays. ""I wanted to create a meal for Thanksgiving and Christmas.""The reaction after the funds posted was immediate and emotional. Consumer 'Food is important': Organization feeds families during SNAP freeze Joel Lopez ""I'm feeling good, I'm feeling calm, less stress, I felt like the whole world was on me, but that has been lifted,"" said Walker. ""Now, my kids are able to eat and stuff, it feels good.""Her sons are already pitching in to prepare the family's Thanksgiving dinner.""My oldest, he loves to cook. He has this thing where he seasons meat a lot better than I do, so I'm going to have him do all the meat seasoning then I'll do the rest,"" said Walker.""

It's one of those things I've been wanting to do since I was 14 and we're making it happen,"" said Walker. "" I have a lot to be thankful for, a lot, cause I could have been in a worse situation.""Walker lives at The Lord’s Place family campus, where organizers said roughly 90% of residents rely on SNAP. Upwards of 40% of residents there remained without their payments at the time of the report. That's why the nonprofit has ramped up food production and mobile distribution to fill gaps, while many families wait for benefits to clear.WATCH BELOW: Food Finder Map grids out free locations Need food?

It restores a little calm, lets her focus on school, and gives her boys a chance to take part in a holiday tradition that bonds the family.""I'm just happy and thankful for everyone that's helped me get to where I'm at,"" said Walker.","https://www.wptv.com/news/palm-beach-county/snap-funds-reach-west-palm-beach-widow-days-before-thanksgiving"

And here in Palm Beach County, AACY's school-based program supports nearly 700 caregiving youth — a number they said is growing, and a need that's deeper than they've seen in nearly 30 years.""They're a hidden population, and so having this extra resource for Thanksgiving is so important to them, because the majority of our families are financially insecure,"" said Dr. Connie Siskowski, founder and president of AACY.As volunteers called out names and handed out holiday kits, one of the families preparing for Thanksgiving with help from the program is the Alexanders of Lake Worth Beach.Twelve-year-old Jasmine Alexander is the oldest of three siblings.

""Jasmine really has been an anchor, she's really held it down, even though at 12 you really shouldn't have to deal with stuff like this.""The mother admits she worried about disappointing her children this Thanksgiving.

However, the excitement over the facility's makeover is tempered by uncertainty surrounding longtime tennis director Skip Jackson's future role.WATCH BELOW: Future of beloved tennis coach left in limbo Beloved tennis instructor may lose his job During construction, Jackson has been conducting lessons at nearby Howard Park, maintaining his connection with students like Amber Grow, who has been under his tutelage for two decades.""I started playing tennis with Skip in 2001 when I was 15 years old,"" Grow said.She remembers the poor condition of the South Olive courts before the renovation project began.""The courts were empty, in poor condition, weeds growing out of them,"" Grow told WPTV Monday.When Grow moved back to the city, she reconnected with Jackson and the tennis community at South Olive.""He has also been such a welcoming, fun presence,"" Grow said.

By: Dave Bohman Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A West Palm Beach moving company owner claims he was the victim of an international extortion scheme after his business was bombarded with fake negative Google reviews, then offered a $200 deal to have them removed.Gareth Larkin's moving company had maintained a near-perfect online reputation with 70 of 72 reviews giving him five out of five stars on Google Maps.WATCH BELOW: Local Business owner among many targeted in Google reviews extortion scheme Florida business owner among many targeted in Google reviews extortion scheme ""As a business owner, you really try and do the right thing for customers,"" Larkin said.But earlier this month, his company received 14 one-star Google Maps reviews over just two days. One called the workers ""unprofessional, slow, and rude."" Another described it as the ""worst moving experience I've ever had."" A third claimed movers ""dragged furniture across the floor, causing scratches.""Before the incidents, Larkin's Moving had a 4.9 stars out of 5 for a Google review. After the apparent extortion attempts, it dropped to a 4.3.""A lot of people will look at our history on Google and other businesses that will make them determine whether they'll work with you or not, depending on your rating,"" Larkin said.Larkin knew the reviews were fake. Then he received a text message: ""I have received (an) order for 30 bad reviews,"" followed by an offer of ""$200 for this order if you pay me (to take them down).""An investigation revealed that the country code on the text originated from Pakistan.""It's hard to run a small business, particularly when Google allows these networks of scammers halfway around the world to ruin your online reputation,"" said Kay Dean, a former federal investigator and nationally known expert in online fraud.Dean investigated the Google Maps reviews of Larkin Moving and Delivery and compiled a spreadsheet of those posting the one-star ratings. Her research shows the same accounts posting bad reviews for Larkin also targeted a cleaning service in Central Florida, car dealers in New Jersey and businesses in Spain, the United Kingdom and New Zealand on Google. WPTV Kay Dean, a former federal investigator and nationally known expert in online fraud, speaks with investigative reporter Dave Bohman. Some of these businesses received similar texts demanding money to remove the posts or face more bad reviews, all coming from Pakistan.""There's this whole underworld of nefarious activities underpinning what the public actually sees on Google, and this includes just an ocean of fake positive reviews, fake negative reviews, and even extortion,"" Dean said.Just a day after speaking with Larkin, several scathing reviews of a spa in Orlando appeared online. The same names posting one-star ratings on Larkin Moving posted bad Google reviews for the Key Massage and Facial Spa in Orlando. The spa's owner tells WPTV that she was also offered the opportunity to have the reviews removed for $200.Dean said Google should be able to prevent most of these bogus reviews from being posted in the first place.""And it's insufficient from a billion-dollar tech company,"" Dean said.Google did not respond to multiple email requests for comment. The company's website reports: ""Last year, our AI-powered detection systems blocked or removed more than 12 million fake business profiles and over 240 million reviews.""Larkin never paid the $200 to have the bogus reviews removed. His business regained its 4.9-star average review after he was able to get Google to take down the fake reviews. But for four days, those negative reviews were online for potential customers to see.""If it had stayed on there long term, it would be very hurtful for the business. A lot of people rely on the reviews,"" Larkin said.For consumers looking to do business with a company and relying on Google Maps reviews, experts suggest watching for one red flag: If a business receives several bad reviews in a short period of time, chances are these reviews are fake.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

"Florida lawmaker proposes pool safety bill after Scripps News investigation","Scripps News Investigates Florida lawmaker proposes vacation rental pool safety bill after Scripps News investigation Bill would allow the state to suspend or revoke a license if the vacation rental is not in compliance. The bill would allow the state to suspend or revoke a license if the vacation rental is not in compliance. (Scripps News) By: Lori Jane Gliha , Brittany Freeman Posted and last updated A Florida lawmaker has proposed legislation to impose pool safety requirements on short-term rental properties after a Scripps News investigation revealed dozens of child drownings at vacation homes.State Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat, introduced Senate Bill 608 last week.The bill would require those seeking a new short-term rental license or a license renewal to have at least one pool safety feature in place if the property has a pool. It would also authorize the state to suspend or revoke a license if the vacation rental is not in compliance.Options for the required safety feature include: an exit alarm on doors and windows leading to the pool, a safety pool cover, a swimming pool water alarm, a self-latching device on doors leading to the pool, and a barrier fence that surrounds a swimming pool.RELATED STORY | Scripps News investigation finds vacation home deaths involving childrenCurrently, the state residential pool safety law requiring at least one pool safety feature only applies to properties built after the year 2000, when the law was enacted. But Smith’s bill would expand those requirements to vacation rental properties seeking short-term rental licenses, regardless of when the property was built.Smith said this summer he planned to introduce the bill after seeing a series of Scripps News investigations focused on child drownings in backyard pools in vacation homes.“That was an issue that we knew was a problem, but we didn't realize the extent of the problem until we saw some of this reporting that has been put together by Scripps News,” Smith said in September.RELATED STORY | Airbnb adds safety feature to waterfront listings and homes with poolsIn its ongoing investigation, Scripps News has obtained records from fatal and non-fatal drowning incidents at vacation home rental pools in Florida involving at least 50 children since 2021.The vacation home bill is one of three bills proposed by Smith this month aimed at improving water safety. He also proposed a drowning prevention education bill, and reintroduced a proposal to require properties built before 2000 to adopt pool safety features when they are transferred or sold. That proposal failed in last year’s legislative session.If the vacation rental pool safety bill passes, it is written to take effect next July.The 2026 Florida legislative session is set to begin in January.","https://www.wptv.com/scripps-news-investigates/florida-lawmaker-proposes-vacation-rental-pool-safety-bill-after-scripps-news-investigation"

Treasure Coast Blue Star Mothers recently wrapped up a supply drive and shipped out many care packages, but Beck said it's an effort they continue all year. ""If you can just know someone cares and you can get something, maybe you can just smile for a little bit that day,"" Beck said. Beck told Glass the best way for the community to get involved with gathering supplies for future care packages is to pick up an item from the nonprofit's wish list.","https://www.wptv.com/community/lets-hear-it/military-moms-focused-on-supporting-our-soldiers-veterans-and-families"
