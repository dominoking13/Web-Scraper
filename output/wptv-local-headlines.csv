"Treasure Coast residents keep close eye on Imelda as it nears Florida's coast","WeatherWeather News Treasure Coast residents keep close eye on Imelda as it nears Florida's coast WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted STUART, Fla. — As Tropical Storm Imelda makes its way towards the Bahamas, residents on the Treasure Coast are staying cautious about any impacts from the storm. They say their biggest concern is what the system could bring to local beaches. Tropical Storm Imelda? Treasure Coast residents keeping close eye on depression On Saturday, the scene in Martin County was still calm, sun, sand and waves, but beachgoers admitted they were keeping a close eye on the forecast as the storm moves to Florida’s east coast.“You can see the water; it looks calm now, but it can change in a minute,” Mike Silverman said. ""I’d rather err on the side of caution.""WATCH: Treasure Coast residents keeping eye on the tropics Along the coast, some homeowners say they’ve already started preparing.“We’re ready, we’re always ready,” one resident said. “I have my shutters already; they’re not up yet, but we’ll see what happens.”While Florida is not projected to take a direct hit, the storm could bring heavy rainfall, dangerous rip currents, and waves up to 11 feet.From the beach to downtown Stuart, it was business as usual on Saturday. Still, many said they weren’t taking the watch lightly.“We got the notifications on the phone, and we’ve got water at the house, plenty of canned goods, it should be OK,"" a longtime resident said. “Other than that, we’ll ride out the storm like we always do.”Lifeguards say they’re monitoring beach conditions closely and could apply restrictions for swimmers if the surf becomes too dangerous. ; }).then(); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego WPTV takes a look back at historic tornado outbreak Surfing Blog Hurricane Duo to bring swell this week James Wieland","https://www.wptv.com/weather/weather-news/treasure-coast-residents-keep-close-eye-on-imelda-as-it-nears-floridas-coast"

"Golden lion tamarins and sloths become unlikely roommates at Palm Beach Zoo","LifestylePalm Beach Zoo Golden lion tamarins and sloths become unlikely roommates at Palm Beach Zoo ( ) AP Photo/Cody Jackson A golden lion tamarin is fed by Devin Clarke inside its new habitat at the Palm Beach Zoo Conservation Society on Thursday, Sept. 18, 2025 in West Palm Beach, Fla. By: Associated Press Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Golden lion tamarins and Hoffman's two-toed sloths have become unlikely roommates in a brand new habitat at the Palm Beach Zoo and Conservation Society in Florida.Both species are native to the forests of South America, which is why the new habitat features a thick canopy of trees. The golden tamarins, with their distinct orange mane, love frolicking in the treetops, while the sloths are perfectly happy hanging from the trees. An inside look at the Palm Beach Zoo's newest exhibit “Maybe the golden tamarins think of the sloth as more furniture because they don’t really do too much. They’re more sedentary,” said Devin Clarke, a senior supervisor at the zoo. ""They like to sleep during the day, a little bit more active at night. So just watching, you know, like their couch walking around at night isn’t too scary for them.”The habitat, which opened in late August, offers the sloths and tamarins a unique space to interact with one another — or mind their own business. The space features a network of vines, ropes and tunnels that encourages exploration, zoo officials said.“Just being able to see them up close and personal is really a way to inspire connection,” Clarke said. “And once people start really having that connection and harboring that connection with the wild animal, they’re able to look at their lives and say, ‘What can I do differently to help these animals’ wild counterparts down in Brazil and Central America thrive?’”He said that in the 1970s, there were less than 200 golden tamarinds in the wild. Some 40 zoos accredited through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums put together a plan to rerelease the species into the wild. Their numbers topped 5,000 as of last year, he said.The previous tamarin habitat at the zoo was a little smaller, Clarke said.“We wanted to be able to give them a better well-being, so enhancing their lives with enrichment, with space, so they can act a little bit more natural,” he added.Conservation is part of the Palm Beach Zoo's identity, so native Florida plants are part of the new habitat.“Planting those Florida native plants within that habitat is a great way to highlight something we can do at our own homes ,” Clarke said. “Even if you have an apartment, just putting out a potted plant that’s a Florida native plant helps kind of revitalize the ecosystem that we have here in South Florida.”The new habitat provides an opportunity for visitors to have get a closer view of the two species, said Margo McKnight, the zoo's president and CEO.“We hope to foster a love for wildlife in wild places, including our own backyards. We hope every person leaves inspired to be a wildlife hero in their own community,” she said.

The ruling gave him until this past Wednesday to pay the money back or face a court-ordered auction of the property.Tuttle said that the ruling forced him to file for bankruptcy.""I couldn't allow the sale to go through. It would have wiped out all the unsecured creditors,"" he said.When asked if that meant nobody would have gotten their money back, Tuttle responded with one word.""Zero,"" he said.WPTV reporter Michael Hoffman reached out to The Fuse Group multiple times for comment, but has not received a response.Despite the bankruptcy, Tuttle said he has another backer — The Ardent Companies of Atlanta, Georgia — prepared to pay off the full balance and keep the project on track.""Obviously, a bankruptcy puts it in jeopardy. But given that we've got such a strong equity, a partner who wants to move forward, and given that what we're proposing is to build it and to pay the bank and unsecured creditors, we feel very, very confident we'll get this worked out in short order,"" Tuttle said.Tuttle said the next steps are to get a third-party mediator to get the project back on track.""I've worked with these people for over 10 years,"" Tuttle said.

"Renting vs. Buying: Which monthly rate is cheaper?","MoneyReal Estate News Study finds renting may be more economical than buying a home WPTV's Joel Lopez searched for the answers and explored the latest findings from a study by Realtor.com, which revealed that renting could save you nearly $1,000 more a month compared to buying a home WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — WPTV has stayed by your side helping you navigate the cost of living in South Florida.We have been listening to homeowners and renters in search of solutions as they contemplate whether they're better off renting or buying in today's economy.WATCH BELOW: 'Renting when we first moved here made sense,' Susanna Zurecka tells WPTV Study finds renting may be more economical than buying a home WPTV's Joel Lopez searched for the answers and explored the latest findings from a study by Realtor.com, which revealed that renting could save you nearly $1,000 more a month compared to buying a home.The study primarily focused on starter-level homes, making direct comparisons between the monthly costs of renting and purchasing similar-sized units.To gather local insights, WPTV took to Clematis Street in downtown West Palm Beach, asking residents about their housing choices.One of the people we encountered was Mathew Hancock, who opted to rent after relocating from Miami three years ago.""Right now, the interest rates are just a bit too high, and I just didn't want to be tied down for the next 30 years or however long it may be,"" Hancock explained. ""Renting adds the fluidity to move wherever I want.""He shared that he pays $2,400 a month on rent.""When you were looking at houses to possibly buy, was there anything close to what you would've paid monthly?"" WPTV's Joel Lopez inquired.""Not in the area I wanted, and anything I did want was in a building where there was a lot of fees involved,"" Hancock responded.We also met Susanna Zurecka, who moved from Michigan within the last year and also chose the rental path.""We're paying a little bit over $5,000 (a month); that's with rent, utilities, water, all of that,"" Zurecka stated. ""It is a two-bedroom, two-bath; it's pretty big for that apartment complex, brand new, they opened it in August of last year.""Now, Zurecka is taking her first step into homeownership, sharing that she just closed on a house in Boynton Beach.""Renting when we first moved here made sense, because we didn't know if we were going to stay in the area, if we were going to move,"" she explained. ""Now that we know we're going to stay in the area, buying made more sense, because we wanted that money to go into the home so that we could see it again."" However, Zurecka acknowledged that the costs would be higher now that she has purchased a four-bedroom, three-bath home with two stories and a pool.""Have you factored in what your monthly fees will look like now owning a home?"" Lopez asked her.""Yes, they look to be about the same, a little more expensive with the mortgage and everything, but very, very similar to our rent,"" Zurecka replied.WPTV analyzed the details from Realtor.com's study, which specifically examined monthly expenses for starter-level homes, including 1 and 2-bedroom units and studios.The study found that while rents are decreasing, home prices continue to increase nationwide.To offer further expertise, we consulted with Danielle Hale, the chief economist at Realtor.com.She emphasized a crucial question for potential buyers: how long do you plan to stay in a location?""You have to be in a home for a really long time in order for buying to end up being a better financial decision,"" Hale noted. ""If you're only going to be there a couple of years, in that case, take the savings up front as a renter and then you can save up as a down payment.""To calculate the monthly expense of purchasing a home, the study first identified the median list price for homes with 0-2 bedrooms (commonly referred to as starter homes).Considering that first-time buyers typically make smaller down payments, they set a down payment of 9% and utilize the 30-year fixed mortgage rate for that month to compute the monthly mortgage payment.The study then factored in the average costs of HOA fees, taxes, and homeowners' insurance at the metropolitan level and compared the buying costs against the median rent in each metro area, concentrating on the differences in monthly expenses.The findings revealed that renting would save individuals an average of $908 a month compared to buying a starter home.Although these numbers lean toward renting being the more economical choice in the short term, Hale added.""That doesn't mean that it might not make sense for individuals to buy a home if they're thinking the really long term and thinking about the equity benefits of buying a home,"" she said.As the national housing market begins to balance, with negotiating power becoming more equitable between buyers and sellers, Hale noted that Florida is slowly shifting towards a buyer's market.""We're starting to see conditions shift; rents are cheaper today, but buyers are getting more negotiating power back in the housing market, particularly in Florida,"" she explained. ""While it's still pretty expensive to buy, you may find success asking for price cuts or contingencies on an offer that you may not have been successful at submitting in the past couple of years."" If you're looking to assess your financial situation regarding renting versus buying, Realtor.com offers a convenient calculator to help you understand what costs may look like for you. ; }).then(); HOUSING RESOURCESCounty-by-county resources for renters facing evictionOUR Florida - Emergency Rental Assistance Relief ProgramPalm Beach County Department of Housing and Economic DevelopmentPalm Beach County Community ServicesBoca RatonSt. Lucie CountyMartin CountyIndian River CountySEEKING SOLUTIONS'Priced Out of Paradise' town hall'Coverage Collapse' town hall'Coverage Collapse' special - March 11, 2024'Coverage Collapse' special, WPTV asks CEOs tough questions - June 27, 2024WPTV hosts live town hall in Port St. Lucie on Florida's insurance crisis - Sept. 17, 2024","https://www.wptv.com/money/real-estate-news/study-finds-renting-may-be-more-economical-than-buying-a-home"
"'Last chance' warning issued for city worker after 3rd HR investigation","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach West Palm Beach CIO Paul Jones given 'last chance' warning after 3rd HR investigation in 4 years Human resources investigation found 38 employees within the city’s IT department experienced incidents of mistreatment from Jones WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — West Palm Beach's Chief Information Officer Paul Jones has received a ""last chance warning"" following his third human resources investigation in four years, according to documents obtained by WPTV.The letter comes after a human resources investigation, completed in February, found 38 employees within the city's IT department experienced incidents of mistreatment from Jones. WATCH BELOW: 'Last chance' warning issued for city worker 'Last chance' warning issued for West Palm Beach city employee The investigation said almost every employee described the culture/environment at the department as a culture of fear that kept employees on edge, as well as unwelcome, tense and hostile.""We have determined that your behavior towards employees, has on occasion, not met the standards of professionalism we expect of employees, especially senior managers,"" wrote City Administrator Faye Johnson and Assistant City Administrator Jose Luis Rodriguez in the August letter. ""Also considering prior employee complaints, some of which have been substantiated and some which have not been substantiated, this communication also serves as a last chance warning…should it not be rectified and there be any future sustained recurrences of unacceptable behavior, further action including your immediate separation of employment with the city will be taken.""Records WPTV obtained from a public records request show the human resources investigation came after the union filed a class action grievance, asking the city to remove Jones from his position.Kathleen Carr, a union representative for the Professional Managers and Supervisors Association, told WPTV their grievance is still in arbitration with the city — meaning the city could end up having to settle with the union using taxpayer resources beyond the current resources being used to fight the case. She said they have received several complaints about Jones' behavior at the city and were disappointed the city reacted with a mandatory training from a paid consultant on ""Team Building"" in an email.""[It was] received as a ""white wash"" by the City and an attempt at secondary victimization,"" Carr wrote. ""Teams don't function with abusive leadership as you know.""Kat Joy, a city spokesperson, told WPTV the training was routine.""Like many organizations, we routinely invest in training and professional development opportunities to support our employees and strengthen teamwork,"" wrote Joy in an email.Jones has faced three different human resources investigations while being employed at the city of West Palm Beach. According to his LinkedIn page, he has worked at the city since 2019.Each investigation started after various employees complained about the workplace environment. Employees like Mary Pat Rhodes complained about Jones publicly humiliating employees, yelling and bullying in the workplace. She told WPTV reporter Ethan Stein that Jones ""made every day horrible"" and drove her to quit the city's IT department.""If he could embarrass you or humiliate you, he would jump on it,"" Rhodes said. ""It was so hard to get things done. It was such a hostile, toxic work environment, backstabbing. Nobody would trust anybody.""Rhodes filed the first complaint in July 2021 after documenting various issues within the office. According to records, the city’s HR department investigated ""allegation of mistreatment towards the employees"" and found those allegations were substantiated after talking with 14 employees.""His behavior was described as confrontational and impulsive, and that he was seen yelling and/or slamming doors when frustrated or when he does not like the answer to his question,"" wrote Human Resources employee Sylvia Gregory. ""Employees stated that he occasionally could not control his temper, was demeaning, and not willing to listen to others' point of view. Some employees indicated that he would have preconceived opinions of people without knowing what they do or who they are. This type of behavior was exhibited in front of employees at meetings either in person or virtual meetings.""Records also show Jones was investigated for mistreating employees based on race and gender, but a human resources employee found those claims not substantiated. According to the notice of findings, Jones was required to take courses to help better his communication and leadership skills, and employees noticed a positive change in his behavior.But Jones would be investigated two more times for similar behavior issues as he ran the city’s IT department; three investigations were completed within four years.""Whoever the last person was, I'm really sorry because I wish I had done something that it didn’t happen to them,"" Rhodes told Stein. ""I thought about going to a lawyer. I thought about contacting the paper, and then I just thought sometimes you can't fight city hall.""Records show Diana Alvarez, another city employee, complained in December 2022 after an incident at work where Jones forced her into the space between her desk and his body.""He held that position, breathing heavily close to my head and sarcastically dismissing what I had to say for about a minute,"" Alvarez wrote. ""I have had many male supervisors and coworkers in the five years that I have worked for the city, and had never for even less than a minute felt my physical space being disrespected for the sole purpose of humiliation. I must mention, however, this is not the first time that Mr. Jones approached me in an aggressive, disrespectful manner. He has in the past stormed into my cubicle, early in the morning, when nobody is around, put his hand down forcefully on the desk, got in my face, and yelled over an unrelated work issue.""Alvarez wrote that she spoke up after she received emails and verbal warnings from her immediate supervisor about the quality of her work after the incident.""This is the case of a man that holds a high and respected position, harassing a woman that holds a much lower position than him for the purpose not to build a more productive workforce of course, but to display power and force through humiliation, sadly. I will not be intimidated, and I will be responsible enough to speak up when I must,"" she wrote.According to the notice of findings, dated December 2022, human resources could not substantiate any policy violations after interviewing three employees. However, the records said those employees described Jones' behavior as confrontational, impulsive and yelling when frustrated.""The interviewed employees perceived Mr. Jones as having an intimidating demeanor that interrupts the workplace,"" wrote Kanisha Sims. ""This type of behavior was allegedly exhibited in front of employees in the office and during a virtual meeting.""Jones declined to talk with WPTV on camera or answer questions, but he told us all the allegations made against him are false.A spokesperson for the city of West Palm Beach said it does not comment on pending investigations or personnel issues. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/west-palm-beach-cio-paul-jones-given-last-chance-warning-after-3rd-hr-investigation-in-4-years"

By: Dave Bohman Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A broken elevator at a West Palm Beach condominium complex left disabled residents homebound for more than 10 days, forcing some to miss critical medical appointments and struggle with basic needs like getting food and medication.After WPTV contacted the property management company and elevator repair service, crews quickly restored service to the elevator at the Presidential Golfview Condominiums' 1900 building.Edward, a 62-year-old resident who asked to be identified by his first name only, lives on the fourth floor and had been trapped in his unit for more than a week when the elevator stopped working.WATCH BELOW: WPTV steps in to help residents affected by broken elevator Broken elevator leaves disabled condo residents homebound for more than 10 days ""The elevator is a lifeline in the building if you're handicapped,"" Edward said.When he needed food and medicine over the weekend, Edward was forced to navigate three flights of stairs despite his mobility challenges.""It's pushing me to my limit,"" Edward said.The resident showed us how he laboriously descended the stairs step by step, then hoisted himself back up.""I dread falling,"" Edward said.Edward had to summon a friend to carry his wheelchair down the stairs and drive him to the store and pharmacy.""Handicapped people here, senior citizens, you know, disabled people, we are trapped and we've been trapped,"" Edward said.On the third floor, stroke victim Josh Terrell said he hadn't left his condo since the elevator stopped working. His niece usually takes him to medical appointments, but she couldn't get him down two flights of stairs.""And I just have to roll with the punches,"" Terrell said.As a result, Terrell missed three doctor's appointments.""They'll probably have to come and get me and put me in a home or something,"" Terrell said.When we reached out to the homeowner's association's property manager on Thursday to ask why repairs were taking so long, he referred us to the elevator company. A company official promised to make repairs Friday.The spokesman said it was challenging to find parts for an elevator that is more than 40 years old.WPTV returned to the complex around the same time Edward arrived from a trip to pick up medication. The elevator was back in service, allowing Edward to reach his fourth-floor apartment without the difficult climb.""I appreciate you guys,"" Edward said. ""If Channel 5 didn't come here, it would still be broke.""The Americans with Disabilities Act gives landlords a ""reasonable amount of time"" to repair elevators but provides no defined timeframe for completion.Edward hopes to eventually move to a place with a first-floor unit.The Presidential Golfview Condominiums is a complex with 436 privately owned units, which complicates any potential moves within the buildings since individual owners control each unit rather than a single management company.""This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

"Feds tighten non-citizen truck driver rules after local semi crash","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie County Transportation Department tightens non-citizen truck driver rules after fatal St. Lucie County crash All states must pause issuing commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens until they can comply with the new rules SLCSO/DHS By: Josh Funk Posted and last updated WASHINGTON — The Transportation Department will immediately tighten up the requirements for noncitizens to get commercial driver's licenses after three fatal crashes this year that officials say were caused by immigrant truck drivers who never should have received licenses.The new rules will make it extremely hard for immigrants to get commercial driver's licenses because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will only be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner than that. Troubled trucking firm tied to deadly crash on Florida's Turnpike The nationwide audit of these licenses began after a fatal U-turn crash on Florida's Turnpike in St. Lucie County that killed three people, caused by a truck driver who officials said was in the country illegally. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said fatal crashes caused by truck drivers who shouldn’t have had licenses were also found in Texas and Alabama earlier this year.Duffy also threatened to revoke $160 million in federal funding for California because investigators found that one in four of the 145 commercial driver's licenses for noncitizens issued since June that they reviewed should have never been issued under the current rules.He cited four examples where California issued licenses that remain valid after the driver's work permit expires — sometimes years after. That state has 30 days to audit its program and come up with a plan to comply or it will lose funding.Duffy said the current rules aren't strict enough and a number of states aren't following them. The audit found licenses that were issued improperly in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.""We have a government system designed to keep American families on the road safe. But that system has been compromised,"" Duffy said.Previously, Duffy threatened to pull some federal funding from California, Washington and New Mexico for failing to enforce English proficiency requirements for truckers that went into effect this summer. The Transportation Department is still reviewing the responses from those states.All states must pause issuing commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens until they can comply with the new rules.Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who currently have commercial licenses would qualify under the new rules that are only available to drivers who have either an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. But the rules won’t be enforced retroactively so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.Duffy said that even with the reports of a shortage of truck drivers, he doesn't think the new rules will cause a problem because these licenses represent only about 5% of all commercial drivers licenses.The head of the American Trucking Association trade group praised the Transportation Department's efforts to make sure that everyone who receives a commercial driver's license is qualified and authorized to get one. The group previously called for an audit of these licenses in April. Driver in fatal Turnpike crash will be extradited back to Florida ""Rules only work when they are consistently enforced, and it’s imperative that all state driver licensing agencies comply with federal regulations,"" ATA President and CEO Chris Spear said.The Florida crash drew outrage from President Donald Trump and Duffy and inspired a political fight between the governors of Florida and California. It also put Sikh truck drivers in the crossfire because the truck driver in the Florida crash is a member of that faith.The Texas crash Duffy cited happened in March when a truck driver failed to brake and crashed into a line of cars, causing a 17-car pileup that killed five people. He said the driver, who was not a U.S. citizen, had a history of unsafe lane changes, ignoring traffic signs and multiple violations of service rules.The Alabama crash involved a truck driver on his third day on the job that Duffy said had failed a skills test for speeding during the test. That truck driver, who was not a U.S. citizen, struck four vehicles stopped at a red light, killing two people.On Aug. 12, Harjinder Singh made an illegal turn from northbound lanes of Florida’s Turnpike in St. Lucie, the Florida Highway Patrol said. A minivan that was traveling behind him was unable to avoid the truck’s trailer, which blocked the northbound lanes.Two passengers in the minivan died at the scene, and the driver died at a hospital. Singh and a passenger in his truck were not injured.Singh lived in California but he was originally issued a commercial driver's license in Washington before California issued him a license later. The fallout from the crash fueled a verbal tussle between California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Trump administration.Singh is charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. The federal government has asked that he be transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after his criminal case is complete.Singh faces an arraignment hearing Monday on charges of vehicular homicide and manslaughter, according to court records in St. Lucie County, Florida.Singh has retained a private lawyer, Natalie Knight-Tai, to represent him, records show.___Associated Press Writer Jeff Martin contributed to this report.

"Potential Tropical Cyclone 9 forecast to become Imelda","WeatherHurricane Potential Tropical Cyclone 9 forecast to become Imelda Humberto strengthens to Category 3 hurricane Strengthening Humberto and developing Imelda, staying just off our coast, will have some coastal impacts of large swells next week. By: James Wieland , Sami Squires Posted and last updated A tropical wave, now called Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine, is located near Hispaniola and the Turks and Caicos, and continues to show signs of strengthening. It is forecast to become Tropical Storm Imelda by this weekend.The system is moving toward the southeastern Bahamas, with a good chance that it will become a tropical depression soon.Whether it develops or not, the system is already bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to parts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the Turks and Caicos, and that weather will likely spread to the Bahamas and eastern Cuba soon. Potential Tropical Cyclone 9 likely to become Imelda TRACKING THE TROPICS: Hurricane Center | Hurricane GuideThere’s still some uncertainty on its path and strength, but the risk of wind, rain, and coastal impacts along parts of the Southeast U.S. near Georgia and the Carolinas is growing. Residents in those areas should keep an eye on this system.Locally, we will be watching for swells generated from the potential storm. These swells look to reach us late Sunday into Monday. wptv Humberto is now a Category 3 hurricane with winds now up to 115 mph. Satellite images show the storm becoming more organized, with tall, cold cloud tops and active thunderstorms mainly on its eastern side. It's moving slowly right now due to weak steering winds, but it’s expected to pick up speed and head northwest, eventually turning north by the weekend.Conditions around Humberto are very favorable for rapid strengthening — warm ocean waters, moist air, and light wind shear. Because of that, expect it to intensify significantly over the next few days, possibly reaching major hurricane status by the weekend. Humberto will stay well east of us (~800miles) and not impact our weather, but we will have coastal impacts with large swells in combination with Imelda next week. ; }).then(); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego WPTV takes a look back at historic tornado outbreak Surfing Blog Hurricane Duo to bring swell this week James Wieland HURRICANE GUIDE 2025 STORM NAMESAndreaBarryChantalDexterErinFernandGabrielleHumbertoImeldaJerryKarenLorenzoMelissaNestorOlgaPabloRebekahSebastienTanyaVanWendy TERMS TO KNOWTROPICAL STORM WATCH: An announcement that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are possible within the specified coastal area within 48 hours.TROPICAL STORM WARNING: An announcement that tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are expected within the specified coastal area within 36 hours.HURRICANE WATCH: An announcement that hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or higher) are possible somewhere within the specified coastal area.
