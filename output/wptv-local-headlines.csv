And the principal kept telling me be honest with me because I have cameras,” he said.Nathaniel says he was then questioned by police with his older sister present while his parents were away.“He starts reading me the Miranda rights and asked if I need a lawyer, I said ‘No.’”Yunior says his son admitted to writing the note out of fear.

By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — After two years of war and loss, there may finally be a light at the end of the tunnel in the Israel-Hamas conflict. As of 5 a.m. EST Friday, a fragile ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas officially went into effect. The first phase includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from key areas in Gaza and the beginning of a large-scale return of displaced Gazans to their homes — to name a few of the actions of the deal. Ceasefire begins in Gaza: Local leaders react with cautious optimism Under the terms of the agreement, Hamas now has until 5 a.m. EST on Monday to release 48 hostages — 20 of whom are still believed to be alive.

Surf park proposed for Boca Raton Developers with Boca Surf Park hope the city will approve its proposal, which they say could bring more than $30 million in economic boost and 80 to 100 permanent jobs to the area.WPTV's Ange Toussaint spoke with Boca Surf Park developers Cheyne Cotrell and Matt Oliveira of Boca Surf Park LLC. Both men say they’re hoping to make the project a reality for the district.“It’s the perfect place. It’s nice and south so it’s warm all year round. We can be open 12 months a year,” said Cotrell, a longtime business owner in Boca Raton.Cotrell describes why he decided to invest in the community once again. “We are locals, we live here. I grew up in Boca, my family has, and we just want the best for the community,” Cotrell added.Developers want to lease 20 acres of public land for 99 years in exchange for revenue share with the district. Boca Surf Park is proposing a 3% revenue share for the first 15 years with incremental increases over the lifetime of the development.The project is one of nine proposals that the district received as part of efforts to boost recreational and outdoor activity in the area. Region Indian River County Surf's up in Fellsmere: $30M surf park set to make waves in local economy Cassandra Garcia “The board listened to those presentations, they liked them and now we’re just in the process of finding out the feasibility of the top-ranked proposals,” said Briann Harms, executive director of Greater Boca Raton Beach Park and District. The project received overwhelming support from supporters at Monday’s commission meeting. But not everyone is sold on the idea.

"City contractor's error causes neighborhood to nearly lose clubhouse","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyPort St Lucie City contractor's error causes Port St. Lucie neighborhood to nearly lose property Finn told WPTV the property association has begun reaching out to lawyers and preparing to sue the city over the dispute WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — A Port St. Lucie neighborhood almost lost their community clubhouse after a consultant engineer made a mistake.The error has led to a tax dispute between the neighborhood’s homeowners association and the city of Port St. Lucie, centering around the property. City officials said their consultant engineer originally agreed with the homeowner’s association that the property didn’t have to pay a special assessment, but later changed their mind and reinstated the duty worth about $20,000. WATCH: Error leads to tax dispute between HOA and city of Port St. Lucie Tax dispute threatens clubhouse in Port St. Lucie neighborhood Kelly Finn, who is the president of the Veranda Gardens homeowners association, said the community didn’t know the city reinstated the tax. She said she got a notice from the St. Lucie County Tax Collector’s Office warning her about years of unpaid tax bills and a potential upcoming property sale. ""It was a very big surprise since we had a document saying that we were never going to have to pay this again,"" Finn said.WPTV met Finn at one of our Let’s Hear It events. She shared a document showing the city of Port St. Lucie sent a letter to the county tax collector in January 2022, asking to “remove all future assessments” from the clubhouse and asking the tax collector’s office for a refund for past payment years.WPTV also obtained copies of records from the tax collector showing the community received the refund. The records include a tax specialist from their office signing off on the refund and citing the reason as parcel entered in as error. Finn told us their neighborhood got the exemption after showing the city a state law, which shows taxing authorities aren’t able to perform assessments on common elements within subdivisions. ""Ad valorem taxes and non-ad valorem assessments shall be assessed against the lots within a platted residential subdivision and not upon the subdivision property as a whole,” reads Florida code. “An ad valorem tax or non-ad valorem assessment, including a tax or assessment imposed by a county, municipality, special district, or water management district, may not be assessed separately against common elements utilized exclusively for the benefit of lot owners within the subdivision, regardless of ownership.” WPTV The law defines common elements as property used for at least 10 years exclusively for the benefit of lot owners within the subdivision, properties not intended for private ownership and been dedicated to the public or retained for the benefit of the subdivision. The law also includes property required as drainage or retention ponds.Finn said these new bills total around $100,000. She said it’s a hidden burden.“This is a big thing,” Finn said. “You know this is $100,000. We're not talking $50 here.”She said she assumed the bills were a mistake and started meeting with various government officials about the problem. Finn said she has been very disappointed with her various meetings with the city of Port St. Lucie.“I’ve been incredibly disappointed with everybody I’ve talked to at the government because they smile and nod,” she said to WPTV’s Ethan Stein. “And they never answer the questions and explain. I asked questions to one of the finance personnel and she said ‘I don’t know, I didn’t bring my laptop.'"" WPTV wanted to talk with the city of Port St. Lucie about the situation. But the city declined to make anybody available to speak on camera about the situation with the Veranda Gardens homeowners association. A city spokesperson said it would only answer questions in writing. Scott Samples, a strategic communications manager for the city of Port St. Lucie, said a consultant engineer originally made the decision to exempt the property then changed its mind in June 2022.“The City worked with its consulting engineers, who initially agreed that it could and a letter was sent to the St. Lucie Tax Collector’s office requesting a refund on the parcel,” Samples said in email. “However, after further review the consulting engineer determined in June 2022 that their initial conclusion was incorrect and the assessment needed to be added back onto the parcel as agreed upon by the developer in 2015.” He said the city became aware of the issue in February 2025 and acknowledged it’s working with the neighborhood to come to a resolution. Samples also said the city wanted to emphasize that these are not taxes. “Also, just we wanted to emphasize that these are not a tax, but rather a special assessment,” he wrote to WPTV. Finn told us the property association has begun reaching out to lawyers and preparing to sue the city over the dispute.

In this case, it supports the Department of Children and Family Services and its mission to get Floridians off government assistance by partnering them with religious organizations and charities in their communities.WATCH: Was Medicaid money diverted to political groups fighting marijuana amendment? Grand jury probes Hope Florida Foundation's $10 million spending However, lawmakers and prosecutors question whether a $10 million payment that many argue should have gone into the state's coffers was improperly spent.Settlement funds diverted to political groupsThe $10 million in question followed a settlement reached last year with a Medicaid provider called Centene because the state had overpaid them.""There was a $67 million settlement that was actually supposed to go back to our state, but instead, only $57 million was sent to [the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration], and $10 million was wired separately into the Hope Florida Foundation bank account,"" explained State Representative Debra Tendrich, a Democrat from Lake Worth.Tendrich serves on the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee, which, during the 2025 legislative session, investigated whether the Hope Florida Foundation improperly spent that $10 million. Tendrich also serves as the executive director of her own nonprofit organization in Palm Beach County. State Lawmakers investigate Hope Florida over alleged political spending Forrest Saunders The Hope Florida Foundation decided to send the $10 million to two 501(c)(4) organizations. A 501(c)(4) is a nonprofit that, unlike a charitable 501(c)(3), can engage in political spending.Emails from Hope Florida Foundation CEO Joshua Hay last October show grant requests for $5 million apiece were approved to two 501(c)(4)s: ""Save Our Society From Drugs,"" a national organization whose most recent tax filings show net assets of $96,000 going into 2024, and ""Securing Florida's Future,"" which records from the Florida Division of Elections show disbanded in April 2025.Questions about timing and coordinationHay's emails show arrangements to wire each group $5 million within days of their respective requests, made in letters which, at certain points, contain almost identical language.""Apparently, before Hope Florida even knew that they were receiving a $10 million donation, the two recipients of the grants already knew that the money was coming,"" Tendrich said.LETTER FROM SAVE OUR SOCIETY FROM DRUGS: LETTER FROM SECURE FLORIDA'S FUTURE: The subcommittee questioned Hope Florida Foundation Chairman Joshua Hay in April.""Were you concerned at all that someone might scrutinize the largest grant proposal and donations in the history of this foundation?"" asked Rep. Kevin Steele, a Republican whose district covers part of Pasco County, during the April 15 hearing. ""I got assurances through [general counsel] Jeff Aaron and through attestations made in the proposals that it was above board,"" Hay responded. Neither letter mentions that the grant money would be spent on political activity. But within days of receiving those grants, campaign finance records show both organizations sent a combined $8.5 million to ""Keep Florida Clean,"" a political group that successfully fought an amendment to legalize recreational marijuana.Its chair was Governor Ron DeSantis' then-chief of staff James Uthmeier, now Florida's Attorney General.""It was actually brought up in our committee that James Uthmeier was aware about that and was facilitating that behind the scenes,"" Tendrich said.The House subcommittee has since turned its information over to prosecutors in Leon County. Grand jury proceedings started this month.I reached out to Attorney General Uthmeier and Gov. DeSantis. Both have previously dismissed allegations of wrongdoing.
