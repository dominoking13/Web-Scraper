"Former Eviction Task Force member describes dangers of serving notices","NewsTreasure CoastRegion Indian River County Former Eviction Task Force member describes dangers of serving notices after deputy killed Deputy Terri Sweeting-Mashkow killed while serving eviction WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated INDIAN RIVER COUNTY, Fla. — A quiet, upscale neighborhood in Indian River County was transformed into the center of a massive law enforcement response Friday after a routine eviction notice service escalated into tragedy.Authorities spent hours investigating at the Bermuda Club Somerset Bay community, where bystanders say they watched swarms of deputies, tactical units, and a helicopter descend on the area where Deputy Terri Sweeting-Mashkow was fatally shot. Former Eviction Task Force member describes dangers of serving notices after deputy killed “When the helicopter showed up, plus when the SWAT vehicle, that’s when I knew it was bad,” said neighbor Wes Gordon, who witnessed the response unfold.Gordon said he was stunned to learn the situation began with deputies attempting to serve an eviction notice.“That must have been the last thing that person could handle. And they just snapped,” he said.Law enforcement expert Tim Miller, who previously served on an eviction team, told WPTV that the most routine aspects of police work, like serving eviction notices or conducting traffic stops, can often be the most dangerous.“Things can change in a second,” Miller said. “You always go into an eviction with eyes wide open. These were seasoned officers... But it’s also very apparent that in today's world, gunfire erupts in quarter seconds or half seconds, and that's what occurred here.”Miller called the incident “a tragedy beyond belief.” He emphasized that deputies like Mashkow step into harm’s way daily, fully aware of the risks.“This reminds us of the high-cost law enforcement pays just to do their job,” he said. “When you lose a 25-year veteran that everybody respected, it has a huge impact on the department. Our support and prayers need to be with the families and the department during this difficult time.”Miller added that moments like this highlight the importance of appreciating first responders who routinely put their lives on the line.He said a simple thank you “means more than you realize.”WPTV will continue to follow updates from investigators as more information becomes available.MORE WPTV COVERAGE: Region Indian River County 'She died a hero': Family members mourn deputy's death Ethan Stein Region Indian River County 'Absolute tragedy': Neighbors near Bermuda Club community shocked by shooting Tyler Hatfield","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-indian-river-county/vero-beach/former-eviction-task-force-member-describes-dangers-of-serving-notices-after-deputy-killed"
"Palm Beach County scraps plan to buy West Palm Beach hotel for homeless housing","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach Palm Beach County scraps plan to buy West Palm Beach's La Quinta for homeless housing WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Palm Beach County has officially pulled the plug on a proposal to purchase and convert the La Quinta Inn on Okeechobee Boulevard into housing for seniors and veterans on the verge of homelessness. The decision comes months after the County Commission initially voted in March to move forward with buying the 114-room hotel for $16.8 million.County officials now say the deal is dead after inspections revealed significant structural and safety concerns inside the building. According to the county, the hotel had waterlogged floors and ceilings, mold growth, and multiple other hazards, making renovations far more costly than originally anticipated.Because of those findings, commissioners voted this month to terminate the contract. Officials emphasized that no taxpayer dollars were spent before the decision to withdraw.Commissioner Maria Sachs, who opposed the project from the beginning, said the hotel was never a suitable solution for vulnerable residents.“The most important thing is that when we realized as a county government that this was not going to work, we withdrew from the contract… we were not going to put our people in a place that was not suitable for them,” Sachs said.She previously argued that dignity “doesn’t come from a motel room,” and maintains that the county must pursue better long-term options.With the hotel plan abandoned, county leaders say they are turning their attention to alternative approaches to address homelessness. Sachs noted that tiny homes are among the ideas currently being explored, with more discussions expected in the coming weeks.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/palm-beach-county-scraps-plan-to-buy-west-palm-beachs-la-quinta-for-homeless-housing"

By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated VERO BEACH, Fla. — Florida is no stranger to crazy headlines — and we’re following a pretty wild story out of Indian River County.Sheriff Eric Flowers tells WPTV they arrested Brandon Harnois for using his backyard as a shooting range. WATCH BELOW: Man accused of using backyard as a shooting range Man accused of using backyard as shooting range The neighborhood is called Westfield, off 16th Street in Vero Beach. It's near homes and even a youth church camp — and luckily, no one was hurt. A deputy was on patrol Sunday night and just happened to be passing by when he saw tracer rounds fired out of an AR-15-style rifle — they look like fireworks — flying right over busy 16th Street. ""The idea that somebody is shooting in their backyard here is not normal. This is not normal behavior. This is something that's very, very concerning to us,"" Flowers said. FPL says it's going to cost thousands to replace a nearby utility pole hit by the gunfire. There was also reported bullet damage to cabins at the youth camp across the street.The SWAT team was called out and arrested the man at gunpoint. Once they knocked the door down, investigators found a lot of weapons: guns, ammo, a ghost gun, illegal suppressors made from oil cans, a hand grenade and even a few live and unregistered cobras.Now the ATF and FWC are involved in the investigation — the sheriff says the man wasn't even supposed to have guns in the first place. ""He was not supposed to have any weapons. He was arrested back in January for a charge of that, so it's clear that he knew he was not allowed to have weapons. And the volume of weapons and types that he had, really disturbing for somebody who knew they weren't supposed to have those,"" Flowers said. At a press conference Thursday, the sheriff said Harnois is facing the following charges: Shooting deadly missiles into dwellings, vehicles, buildings, or aircraftFiring a projectile across private landFiring a weapon in public or on residential propertyViolation of a domestic violence injunctionResisting an officer without violenceThe sheriff said during the press conference that two more search warrants were issued for Harnois' business and storage units. They recovered more weapons and body armor. Officials expect more charges to come, including state and federal charges. It's still an active investigation.","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-indian-river-county/man-arrested-for-using-backyard-as-shooting-range-in-vero-beach-neighborhood"
