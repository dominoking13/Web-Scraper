Now, one year later, signs of recovery are visible, but the emotional scars remain.New fencing and a fresh metal roof mark progress on the property where Carolina Buera once lived with her mom, Mariela. But the reminders of October 9, 2024, are never far.WATCH MICHAEL HOFFMAN'S COVERAGE BELOW: One year later, Wellington family that survived tornado reflects on recovery and resilience ""I heard it all, and I felt it… all the vibrations,"" said Buera.That night, the tornado from Milton ripped through Wellington, destroying homes and leaving lasting devastation.“When I was outside, I knew the house was going to be very messed up,” she said.A closer look around the property still shows traces of the storm’s path, snapped wood on branches, empty spaces where large trees once stood, and the faint sounds of construction as the community finishes rebuilding around the area.""It's like, weird that it hit us,” she reflected.Carolina still vividly remembers the horror of that day.""It's just like that horrific event replaying in my head, and it’s just like, it doesn't leave, the windows breaking, glass flying everywhere, the roof caving in. I heard it all, and I felt all the vibrations,” said Buera.""I can still imagine, like the dark clouds, the flooding everything, like I could hear it still.""The roof caved in. Birth certificates, passports, and even their only car were lost.""So you start back from zero,” said Buera.WPTV first met the Buera family in the days following the storm. Their car, which had been submerged in a canal, was not only how Carolina’s mother earned a living as a delivery driver, but it was also how Carolina got to school.The community stepped in when the family needed it most, donating a new car and raising more than $20,000 to help them get back on their feet.“I only got it because of you guys and the wonderful community helping out with it,” said Buera.Carolina still considers October 9, 2024, one of the worst days of her life.“Even my brother, he wasn’t even there and it affected him, too,” she said.“He like fell off the stairs trying to get to us and he like almost broke his leg doing it.”In an instant, everything changed, including her perspective.“I was able to turn my life around a little bit, at least mentally and physically,” she said.Through it all, Carolina says her focus is no longer on what was lost — but what was preserved.“I still want to make the best out of my life. And it like, kind of like, like, made me go in a circle and think about my life and my family, like we could have been gone that day,” she said.The Burera family's new GoFundMe can be found here. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/wellington/one-year-later-wellington-family-that-survived-tornado-reflects-on-recovery-and-resilience"
"King tides flood Florida beaches, close access points","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie County St. Lucie County King tides cause flooding along Florida's east coast, close beach access points Coastal flood advisory in effect as king tides and recent rainfall combine to create access issues at popular beach spots WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted ST. LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. — King tides are making waves along Florida’s east coast. The unusually high tides have caused flooding in parts of St. Lucie County, prompting temporary closures of beach access points and a coastal flood advisory through Thursday.WATCH CASSANDRA GARCIA'S COVERAGE BELOW: St. Lucie County King tides cause flooding along Florida's east coast, close beach access points Driving along Ocean Drive on Hutchinson Island you'll likely notice some flooded drainage ditches and swamped parking lots. These unusually high tides, known as king tides, typically occur this time of year.“In fall, October, November, we see our tides that are higher than normal,” said our meteorologist, Sami Squires. “We get this extra pull with the new moon and a full moon, which causes the king tides.”Squires explained that when the sun, moon, and Earth align, the gravitational pull causes water levels to rise as much as one to three feet above average.“That could be flooding on people’s docks, that could be water just coming up a little higher than normal, so boaters can see the impacts as well as people along the beaches,” she added.Two public beach access points in St. Lucie County have been closed as a result: Walton Rocks Beach and Ocean Bay Beachside Park.“Some of it is not impassable, but Walton Rocks—there is about three-quarters of a mile entrance road in that is dirt, and so our concern is getting stuck,” said Erick Gill, communications director for St. Lucie County.Officials say the issue isn’t just the king tides. Recent heavy rains have added to the flooding concerns, particularly around marshy areas.“Those beach accesses—there’s mosquito impoundment marshes that have culverts that connect into the Indian River Lagoon, and so those high tides are bringing that water up,” Gill explained. “And with the wind and the rain we’ve had, a lot of that water is now going into the parking area and entrance roads.”Squires also noted that the rainfall is intensifying the effects of the already high water.“The flood advisory is due strictly to the king tides, but when we get this heavy rainfall that comes down on top of [what] you already are seeing—water that’s inundating our coastline—sometimes that could be hard to drain,” she said.The National Weather Service’s coastal flood advisory will remain in effect through Thursday. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/st-lucie-county-king-tides-cause-flooding-along-floridas-east-coast-close-beach-access-points"

""We’ve had to expand and relocate some of our officers and equipment to around seven different locations throughout the community, simply because we’re out of space.” Zervis told WPTV the city’s population is outpacing the capacity of its aging police headquarters. The current building needs major roof repairs and doesn’t meet state or hurricane standards.“We’re also looking at where the center of the city is,"" he said. ""The city has continued to grow over the past 40 years, but that growth has primarily been to the west.” The new facility would be a two-story, 160,000-square-foot building on Spanish River Boulevard, built on city-owned land.Boca Raton plans to use $15.2 million from its general fund and is proposing a combination of bonds and public funds to pay for the rest. The city is asking residents to approve up to $175 million of the $190 million price tag through a tax bond.City council voted to put the resolution on the March 10, 2026 ballot. City of Boca Raton If approved, the millage rate would increase from 3.6649 to 3.9254, which could affect property taxes.“The issuance of this bond, if it were approved by the voters, the millage rate would still be below all comparable cities,"" Zervis said.If voters reject the bond referendum, Zervis said the city will explore other ways to fund the project.Either way, Boca Raton Police Chief Michele Miuccio said the department will maintain a downtown presence during construction.“We would continue having our fingerprinting, we would be able to get reports and evidence,” she said.Zervis said residents will get a chance to weigh in on the proposal before the March elections through public meetings.

WATCH BELOW: 'This is all just for them to up our taxes,' resident Sherie Wagner tells WPTV City delays annexation plan as residents oppose city's approach The city had planned to move forward with annexing the Palmyra and Bamboo Lane neighborhoods, which is part of a broader effort to bring dozens of unincorporated areas into the city, expanding its boundaries by more than 4,500 acres.City officials said the move would streamline services and eliminate a 25% water surcharge currently paid by county residents. But many residents said they feel left out of the process.""This is all just for them — a money grab, to up our taxes,"" said Palmyra resident Sherie Wagner. She and her neighbor, Waheeda Rodriguez, said they gathered more than 150 signatures opposing the plan, arguing that Boynton Beach is using a decades-old water service agreement as a loophole to force annexation.""We feel like we don't have a voice with them,"" Rodriguez said. ""At the last meeting, they said it's going to happen regardless.""Typically, annexations occur through special elections, state legislation, or voluntary petitions. In this case, the city is relying on an older agreement stating that signing up for Boynton Beach water service doubles as consent to annexation.While city officials said residents would benefit from lower property taxes once certain county fees are removed, residents argue the financial math doesn't add up.""When we reviewed all their numbers, it didn't make sense,"" Rodriguez said. ""We're looking at least a $1,000 per homeowner annually for the taxes.""City Manager Dan Dugger said the delay gives both sides time to continue discussions. The city and county are exploring whether Palm Beach County might purchase Boynton Beach's water treatment facilities — a move that could reduce service overlap and financial strain.Commissioners are expected to revisit the annexation plan in about two months. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boynton-beach/boynton-beach-delays-annexation-plan-as-residents-disapprove-of-citys-approach"
"DeSantis met with 'Free Kill' law opponents, ignored families","NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates Records show DeSantis met with opponents of ‘Free Kill’ law repeal, not victims’ families Public records reveal governor's meetings with special interest groups before vetoing Wrongful Death Act repeal Scripps By: Katie LaGrone Posted Newly obtained public records reveal Florida Governor Ron DeSantis met with special interest groups opposing a bill to repeal Florida's Wrongful Death Act in the weeks before his veto, while families supporting the legislation say they were ignored.WATCH KATIE LAGRONE'S COVERAGE BELOW: Records show DeSantis met with opponents of ‘Free Kill’ law repeal, not victims’ families In May, Florida families told us how they desperately sought meetings with Governor DeSantis to discuss the Wrongful Death Act. The 35-year-old law is often referred by critics as the ""Free Kill"" law.The Wrongful Death Act prevents certain families from suing for pain and suffering in cases of alleged medical malpractice if the family member was not married and, at least, 25 years old at the time of their death.Since 2022, Investigative Reporter Katie LaGrone has reported on issues with the law and family efforts to get it off the books.""We've requested meetings with him, but to no avail,"" one family member told us shortly before the governor’s veto.""We have not even received a response to our requests for a meeting,” said another.Last session, a bill to abolish the law received overwhelming bipartisan support in the legislature. However, DeSantis vetoed the measure during a televised press conference at a Florida hospital. During the press conference he was flanked by doctors, hospital executives and lobbyists who have long argued that repealing the law would increase medical malpractice claims and insurance rates.""This bill would have negative impacts across our healthcare system,"" DeSantis said. Five months later, public records obtained through a record request show DeSantis' office received nearly 7,000 letters and emails about the legislation and potential veto. The majority came from people pleading with the governor not to veto the bill.Lauren Korniyenko was among those who wrote to the governor. She lost her mother to what she believes was a medical mistake but she’s unable sue for pain and suffering because her mother wasn't married and was over 25 at the time of her death.""Signing HB 6017 would reaffirm your commitment to life, to families, and to our constitutional rights,"" Korniyenko wrote to the governor in May.Korniyenko said she also requested a meeting with DeSantis but only managed to get a brief encounter with his chief of staff.""It was very clear from the conversation that they were not in receive mode in talking with us. The decision had already been made,"" she said.Sabrina Davis has fought to end the law since 2020, when her father died from what she believes was medical negligence. She told us how she’s tried to meet with the governor for years.""I would say, going on five years, that I've been asking for a meeting with no success,"" Davis said.The governor's public calendar between January and the end of May shows DeSantis didn't meet with a single family or group that supported the bill. However, his calendar reveals that he did meet with special interest groups who have a history of opposing the legislation to eliminate the state’s Wrongful Death Act.On March 31, just days after House lawmakers approved the full repeal, DeSantis met with Chamber of Commerce President Mark Wilson. The Chamber has opposed efforts to eliminate the law for years.A Chamber spokesperson wouldn't confirm if the bill was discussed and only stated in an email that Wilson ""regularly meets with the Governor"" and other leads. The spokesperson added, ""those discussions will remain between Mark and those leaders.""Then in late April, about 10 days before the bill received final legislative approval, DeSantis' calendar shows he met with the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, which advocates on behalf of more than a dozen public hospitals statewide.According to a spokesperson, the meeting was part of an annual ""thank you"" tour.Mark Delegal with The Doctor's Company, an insurer for physicians, has lobbied for both the Chamber and Safety Net. He said the Wrongful Death Act bill came up during Safety Net’s discussions with the governor, but it was the governor who brought it up he said.""I know the governor was watching this bill carefully,"" Delegal said. ""Now that it's seeping back into my mind, I did hear that he brought it up.""Safety Net's spokesperson said the group never officially opposed the bill and no one from the organization requested a veto.Last month, a new bill to repeal the law was filed in the House by Republican lawmaker Dana Trabulsy of St. Lucie County. A bill has yet to be filed in the Senate. But for families still fighting to end Florida's Wrongful Death Act, these recently obtained records may be just a snapshot of who the Governor met with, but they confirm their suspicions about who seems to have the best chance of getting access to the governor.""It's painful, it's hurtful,"" Davis said. ""We are the people of Florida. We are the ones who vote him in office, and the least he could do is talk to the families, especially about such a big bill.""The governor's office didn't respond to requests for comment about our findings and whether Governor DeSantis met with families or other groups who supported the bill before he vetoed it.Republican Senator Clay Yarborough, who sponsored the bill to repeal the law confirmed to Reporter LaGrone that he met with the governor about two weeks before the Senate voted to approve the bill.Yarborough said the governor told him he couldn't support the legislation without damage caps. Lawmakers rejected those caps, and DeSantis rejected the bill. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/state/records-show-desantis-met-with-opponents-of-free-kill-law-repeal-not-victims-families"

"Union urges city to acknowledge injury claims due to mold at police HQ","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach More than 100 West Palm Beach police officers have filed injury claims related to mold exposure The city sent WPTV a statement saying as of Monday, it acknowledged all injury claims from West Palm Beach Police Department WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — More than 100 West Palm Beach Police Officer’s have filed injury claims related to mold found in the police station, according to an attorney for the police officers' union.According to records WPTV obtained from a public records request, around 41 different areas of the West Palm Beach Police Headquarters building need mold or malodor remediation. The mold was found throughout all three floors and the building’s basement, including multiple senior command staff offices and hallways across the building.WATCH: Union urges city to acknowledge injury claims due to mold More than 100 West Palm Beach police officers file injury claims related to mold exposure Documents WPTV received show a survey conducted by the union, Fraternal Order of Police for West Palm Beach, said the most common symptoms officers reported are respiratory and pulmonary issues like chronic cough, sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, chest tightness and asthma-like symptoms. The survey also said other main symptoms included cognitive complaints, skin issues and other general health complaints like fatigue. The survey said some officers reported serious health conditions due to mold in the police station like strokes, autoimmune conditions, hypertension, blood disease and cardiovascular problems.Geoff Bichler, attorney for the police union, said these types of complaints aren’t uncommon when a police station tests positive for mold. He said the number of complaints, which he estimates is around a third of budgeted positions for sworn officers, occurs when problems are more long standing.PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Mold or foul odors found in 41 areas of West Palm Beach police station Report: Mold or foul odors found in 41 areas of West Palm Beach police station “If it’s a chronic situation where a building is sick and people have been working in that environment for a very long time, then it is not unusual to see large numbers of people who are complaining about physiological effects,” Bichler said. When WPTV obtained the records back in August, Union President Adam Myers told WPTV’s Ethan Stein that employees long suspected the police station had a mold problem.“It confirms our suspicions,” Myers said in August. “Employees for years have been concerned about the condition of the building.”He applauded Chief Tony Araujo's decision at the time to bring in a third party to test the building for mold. However, new documents show Myers is upset the city hasn’t responded to any officers filing the injury claim paperwork called “First Reports of Injury/Exposure”.“Despite the volume of reports submitted, employees have yet to receive any known response from the city,” Myers wrote in a letter dated Oct. 2, 2025. “This lack of acknowledgment or follow-up is unacceptable… These employees deserve immediate medical evaluation, proper treatment, and the assurance that their health and safety are being prioritized by their employer.” Bichler said the acknowledgment is essential because it’s the first step in getting benefits for work-related injuries. He said the city can then provide benefits, evaluate and investigate or deny a claim after it’s filed and acknowledged by the city. But, without the acknowledgment, the process can’t get started.“What you have here is something that is really unusual in my experience,” Bichler said. “Because the reports of injury are made, there’s no official acknowledgment of it and nothing has been done.” Seeking answers, WPTV reached out to the city of West Palm Beach. The city declined to make somebody available and sent us a written statement, saying as of Monday it acknowledged all injury claims from West Palm Beach Police Department.Kat Joy, a spokesperson for the city of West Palm Beach, said the building is safe while it spends $6 million to address long-standing maintenance issues, critical upgrades and extending the life of the building. She also said all officers have the opportunity to seek medical treatment for their injuries.“Every individual who files a Report of Injury has the option to seek medical treatment, and the city remains committed to ensuring their health and safety throughout this process,” said Joy. Bichler described that statement as a dodge. He said everybody has the right to see a doctor, but the issue is if the city should pay for the evaluation.“It sounds very flip,” Bichler said. “Like, ‘Oh yeah, you can go see a doctor,’ fine. Well, the city is supposed to pay for the doctor. That’s the point. If you’re injured on the job or if you become sick because of something that happens to you that is work-related, it is the employer's obligation to apply medical care for that condition. That’s really the crux of the matter here.” He said he was prepared to sue West Palm Beach over the dispute if necessary. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/more-than-100-west-palm-beach-police-officers-have-filed-injury-claims-related-to-mold-exposure"
