"Fort Pierce city manager wins over city leaders 6 months into the job","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyFort Pierce Fort Pierce city manager wins over city leaders 6 months into the job After stepping into the role following a turbulent leadership change, City Manager Richard Chess receives strong reviews and a raise as commissioners set their expectations for the future. Six months after taking the helm as Fort Pierce’s city manager, Richard Chess is earning high marks from city commissioners, who say he’s bringing stability and fresh direction to city operations. By: Cassandra Garcia Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Six months after taking the helm as Fort Pierce’s city manager, Richard Chess is earning high marks from city commissioners, who say he’s bringing stability and fresh direction to city operations.“Your six months has been, you got thrown right into the deep-end and so far I'm very pleased,” Mayor Linda Hudson said during a performance review at the city commission meeting Monday. Fort Pierce city manager wins over city leaders six months into the job Commissioners offered similar praise, describing Chess as a capable and strategic leader.“You truly are a chief executive officer and I say that as a true compliment,” said Commissioner Michael Broderick. “You are skilled at it and I am confident that we are going to deal with one issue at a time.”Chess, who previously served as Broward County’s assistant general manager of transportation, stepped into the role after former City Manager Nick Mimms was fired following his arrest last year on charges of bid rigging and official misconduct. The scandal left the city searching for steady leadership to guide its recovery.During the selection process, Chess and City Clerk Linda Cox were the final two candidates for the role. When Chess was appointed, Broderick and Hudson were among those who opposed the decision, but both now say their perspectives have changed.“I was very impressed with what you have, the knowledge you gained, and I think that you're a staff champion, and I appreciate that, except that you're not a pushover,” Hudson said.Broderick also acknowledged his shift in perspective. “I was wrong and I admit it,” he said. “Change is here, it's being implemented, and you have the respect of the city commission to get this done.”Commissioner Arnold Gaines commended Chess for his proactive approach. “I like how you have systematically started to not only attack and try to fix the problems but you are not afraid to call out the problems and bring it to our attention,” Gaines said.After the review, Chess was granted a 5% raise in accordance with the terms of his contract. Commissioners also laid out clear expectations for his future leadership.“I think that the King’s Landing development which has now been approved and back on, that we need to really work closely with them and make sure that that is a success because that's something that has been a long time coming,” Hudson said.Gaines added a challenge for the city manager as he continues to settle in. “You had the first two months and you finally took off a glove. I'm asking you to take off both gloves and roll your sleeves up, and get down to doing what we hired you to do to address the issues that you know are there.”As Chess looks ahead, city leaders say the city manager is poised to steer Fort Pierce toward progress.

"Wellington mother turns grief into healing with ‘Wind Phone’ at local preserve","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWellington Wellington mother turns grief into healing with ‘Wind Phone’ at local preserve After losing her husband and son to cancer, Debbie Cyran helps create a space for comfort and connection in nature WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated WELLINGTON, Fla. — Deep inside the Wellington Environmental Preserve, a quiet new addition is helping people connect with loved ones they’ve lost — one call at a time. It’s called a “Wind Phone.” While it doesn’t actually have reception, the meaning behind it is powerful.“It’s just a little box,” said Debbie Cyran. “You slide it out, pick it up, and you make a phone call — and the wind just carries your words to your loved ones in spirit.” Wellington mother turns grief into healing with “Wind Phone” at local preserve Debbie knows loss all too well. She lost both her husband, Stanley Cyran in 2018, and her son, Steve Carnahan, to cancer just last year.In the depths of grief, she connected with a support group called Helping Parents Heal, and that’s where she first learned about the concept of a Wind Phone.“We took a little trip down to Hillsborough Beach, where there is a wind phone, and it's in a beautiful place,” said Cyran. “It's behind the police station, but it's like right on the edge of the waterway, the intercostal waterway, and it's just absolutely beautiful, and it's very calming. It's comforting. And so I was talking to my friend, and I said, you know, I'd like to do one of those. I think I'd like to put one in my in my garden. Then I decided, you know, the only people that would be able to use it are the people in my family and my friends. So let's put it somewhere where everybody can use it.”When she brought the idea to the Village of Wellington, officials suggested placing it in the very park where Debbie’s family spent so much time together. For her, it felt meant to be.“I feel them here,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons I come so often. I feel them around me a lot.”Debbie visits the preserve nearly every week. She often dials her old home phone number before speaking softly into the receiver.“Hey honey,” she said during her visit with WPTV’s Michael Hoffman. “We’re really doing this.” WPTV At the base of the Wind Phone, visitors have left painted memorial rocks and a notebook filled with handwritten messages — tokens of love, loss, and healing from people who’ve made their own calls to the wind.“It is beautiful,” Debbie said. “I’m so grateful we put this here, and that so many people can be comforted and healed. It’s part of the healing process.”The Wind Phone now stands as a quiet reminder that love doesn’t fade, and that even in grief, connection is still possible.

It's just a family,' Rick Malave tells WPTV This garden is facing financial challenges while nurturing mental health It's a national organization but the local chapter has been in West Palm Beach for 76 years, and has its roots in advocacy for individuals facing mental health challenges.But after years of dedication, a garden which as been a testament to their commitment and therapy, is falling into disrepair.""It's helped me, because at first I was nervous and everything; after being here a few months, I’m like, 'OK, I like this,'"" shared 21-year-old member Laronte Hunter.For him, tending to the garden has opened doors to connection and camaraderie. ""What I love about it mostly is that everybody comes together as one; it's about a whole community,"" he said.He's passionate about the project and motivated to get others involved.""I want to make sure that everybody else be like wanting to work on this garden with me,"" he said. ""Let’s do it, let's get to work!”The garden is alive with colorful flowers, fresh vegetables, and caterpillars preparing to turn into butterflies. Peer specialist Rick Malave sees the butterflies as a metaphor for the clients he says transform by the garden.""The garden is serenity, a place to come decompress, a safe space,"" he explained.Once struggling with addiction, Malave now pays it forward, helping others find healing. ""Here you have a chance to really grow and thrive. It's just a family,"" he said.One of the clubhouse coordinators, Liz Brumley echoed his sentiments. WPTV CEO Andrew McAusland shares with WPTV's Joel Lopez the positive impact the garden is having on the members. ""This garden is hugely enriching,"" said Brumley. ""Just having this space that they’ve created alongside me, we've planted everything here.""However, the garden faces significant challenges. Rotting wooden planters and hungry iguanas threaten the hard work put into nurturing this sanctuary.""We grow things like basil and turn it into pesto, and we love it, but the iguanas, they also like the basil,"" Brumley lamented.To tackle these issues, the nonprofit has set a $5,000 fundraising goal to create an enclosure to protect their plants and replace aging pots and planters.""We've come a long way from the start with the garden. The better it is, the better it is for the mental well-being of our staff and members,"" said Andrew McAusland, CEO of the nonprofit.McAusland notes that the garden serves as a critical resource for members, stating that the environment positively impacts their energy and outlook on well-being.Over the past two years, daily visits have increased from just three members to upwards of 20, thanks in part to raising awareness about mental health resources and to the growth in population he's seen in West Palm Beach.""People who suffer from a mental health challenge are people just like you and me. We're not clinical, we're concerned with how you can contribute and be a part of the community,"" McAusland stressed.He encourages anyone with a loved one facing mental health challenges to visit the center.""We are a refuge for anybody who may otherwise be isolated. What's important is to be connected to a community, and that's what we're about,"" he said.As the garden continues to grow and evolve, the hope remains that support will flourish alongside it.If you'd like to help the garden begin new roots, you can email them at info@mhapalmbeaches.org or call (561) 832-3755.

We were pretty much in survival mode,” said Palm Beach business owner Richard Godden, who distributes popular Jamaican produce to South Florida.Godden said the industry had only recently recovered from last year’s losses.“Fast forward to 2025, the crop rebounded. Right now, they are flourishing but here comes Melissa that’s threatening, that’s probably about to repeat history as far as devastating the industry again,” he said.Godden’s business depends on importing Jamaican staples like callaloo, scotch bonnet peppers, pepper sauce, and jerk seasoning. He fears Melissa could deal a heavy blow to farmers and exporters across the island.“We’re on pins and needles, quite honestly, and just praying for a change in path,” he said.Melissa is expected to dump heavy rain causing life-threatening flash floods and landslides. The concerns go beyond business. Many in the Jamaican diaspora are also bracing for the storm’s potential impact on family and friends back home.“It’s the island-wide impact that this will have on everyone, so that no one will be able to fare better if the hurricane hits in a worst-case scenario,” Godden added.At Jerk Island Jamaican Restaurant in Palm Beach County, longtime business owner Junior Dixon shares the similar concern. WPTV/Trey Herbert Haitian radio personality LeGrand Perisien Salvant. “You’ll have a lot of mudslides, a lot of roads are being eroded,” Dixon said.Melissa has already dumped heavy rainfall across Haiti and the Dominican Republic.“We already have three dead; two in Port-au-Prince due to landslides,” said Haitian radio personality, LeGrand Parisien Salvant.The National Hurricane Center said Melissa could strengthen into a hurricane in the coming days.“It’s going to be devastating,” Godden said. “We’ll repeat what happened in 2024, where we’re just gonna have to pick up the pieces from here.”Residents within the Caribbean diaspora said they’re hoping Melissa changes path or weakens in the coming days.

WATCH BELOW: 'In that moment, it looked like a real video,' Melanie Valentine tells WPTV Experts warn of AI video use after man tries to lure woman into car Melanie Valentine told WPTV she was making keys at the Home Depot on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach around 10 p.m. on Oct. 17, when a man in his 20s approached her with what appeared to be video evidence of someone stealing her husband's truck from the parking lot. ""He said, you have to follow me. You have to follow me. We can catch him. We can catch him,"" Valentine said.The video looked incredibly realistic, but Valentine said she trusted her instincts and refused to follow the stranger outside. Instead, she called police, while her neighbor went to check on the vehicle.""In that moment, it looked like a real video. I thought it was a real video,"" Valentine said. ""But I had that just a gut feeling that something was off, and, of course, I wasn't going to follow the guy out front.""Her neighbor discovered the truck was exactly where they had left it. He also spotted another person crouched behind the vehicle, prompting him to alert Home Depot security.""Yeah, it was wild. It was pretty shocking,"" said Valentine. West Palm Beach police confirmed Valentine filed a report and are investigating the incident as suspicious activity.Valentine said the responding officer told her she hadn't encountered this type of scheme before, but believed it represented a new use of AI technology for carjacking attempts.""Thankfully, I had the wherewithal. I didn't follow them outside, you know, because who knows what would have happened?"" said Valentine.

""So this is very scary to me as a parent, I think to all of us it should be scary.""According to cybersecurity firm DeepStrike, crimes involving AI are surging. The company projects financial fraud enabled by generative AI in the United States will reach $40 billion by 2027, up from $12.3 billion in 2023.The cybersecurity company's study also found deepfake content is rising exponentially, from 500,000 fake videos and photos in 2024 to a projected 8 million by the end of this year.Chagal-Feferkorn advised people to remain vigilant and verify suspicious situations.""The first thing is awareness, it's sad, but we need to not trust things like we used to before,"" she said. ""The second, be more alert, be more suspicious, and if something feels off, try to verify.""Valentine decided to share her story to warn others about this emerging threat.""I really wanted to bring awareness of what is happening, because even the police officer said that she hadn't seen this before. It was really scary, because, you know, you start to think about all of the things that could have possibly happened,"" Valentine said.

WATCH BELOW: 'I have an old roof,' Sandy Goepfert tells WPTV Boynton Beach homeowner denied grant by My Safe Florida Home program Sandy Goepfert spoke with us, because she cannot get a $10,000 grant to help get a new roof.Goepfert said she was told she no longer qualifies even though her neighbors do, because of the household income requirements, which now prioritize low and moderate income homeowners.“I don’t have a leaking roof, but I have a roof. My house was built in ‘03. The potential is, I have an old roof and if at anytime I get a leak, I’d have to pay all of it, instead of the grant of $10,000.”Goepfert is part of the now familiar Group 5, which was eliminated this year by the Florida legislature, and I’ve heard of many of you.The rules for My Safe Florida Home are looked at every year by lawmakers and could change next year.We want to thank everyone who came out to our Let's Hear It at the Boynton Beach Arts & Cultural Center this week and thank you for trusting WPTV with your story. It was a great turnout and we're already getting to work on stories brought to our attention.
