By: Kayla McDermott Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A West Palm Beach man in his late 70s lost $22,000 after falling victim to a sophisticated Bitcoin scheme that began with a fake Amazon fraud alert, police said.It all started with a fraudulent text message appearing to come from Amazon, claiming the victim's account had been compromised.

"St. Augustine Lighthouse: Climb for the 'best view in all of Florida'","LifestyleFinding Florida St. Augustine Lighthouse: 225,000 visitors annually climb for 'best view in all of Florida' From WWII submarine watch to ghost stories: Lighthouse stands tall for 150 years WPTV By: Kate Wentzel Posted ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. — Standing 165 feet tall with 219 steps to the top, the St. Augustine Lighthouse provides visitors with an unparalleled view of Florida's oldest city and serves as a gateway to understanding the area's rich maritime heritage.Lighthouse interpretation department manager Amanda Goodall said the lighthouse is a great first stop for people visiting St. Augustine, so they can get a lay of the land. St. Augustine Lighthouse stands watch over US oldest city The historic lighthouse has illuminated the waters for ships, inspired countless ghost stories, and stood watch over the Matanzas Bay and Atlantic Ocean for nearly a century and a half. Construction took three years due to funding and manpower challenges, but visitors agree the panoramic view is worth every step of the climb.""The good thing is we have eight places to stop and take a rest, so our lighthouse is very leisurely, which I like a lot,"" Goodall explained to visitors preparing for the ascent.Inside the lighthouse, visitors discover fascinating stories from the past, including the tale of Wilma, a lighthouse keeper's daughter who learned her brother used her cat for a daring aerial prank. The cat, named Smokey, parachuted down safely with a makeshift parachute created by the teenage boy.""Wow, this is worth the climb,"" Finding Florida reporter Kate Wentzel said.""Best view in all of Florida,"" Goodall said.More than 225,000 visitors annually take on the challenge of climbing the lighthouse to soak in the scenery overlooking St. Augustine, the Matanzas Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.""We pride ourselves on being the caretakers of St. Augustine's maritime history,"" Goodall said.The lighthouse played a crucial role during World War II, when Operation Drumbeat threatened the American coast. ""Operation Drumbeat was the effort to weaken American resolve by essentially sending vessels off the coast of Florida to sink what they could,"" Goodall said.Beyond the lighthouse itself, visitors can explore a World War II exhibit housed in former Coast Guard barracks. The exhibit reveals how lighthouse keepers received submarine silhouette books to help identify enemy vessels from the tower's peak.""One of my favorite things I've learned from this exhibit is that when the keepers were notified about everything that was going on in a letter, they were issued what's called a submarine silhouette book,"" said Goodall. ""They would take these books to the top of the tower and reference them to look for submarines coming in the late day, to capture their silhouette.""Even during wartime darkness, the lighthouse maintained its vigilant watch over the waters.The lighthouse's history extends beyond maritime navigation into the realm of mystery. Legend has it that this lighthouse ranks among the most haunted in America, with its shadows dancing across paranormal television screens and ghost tours for decades.""We've nicknamed ourselves the nation's oldest port, and presently we consider ourselves the front porch light for the community to always have a light shining bright to guide you home, and we're really proud of that,"" Goodall said.Whether you're a history enthusiast, maritime lover, or curious traveler, the St. Augustine Lighthouse offers an unforgettable journey through time. This beacon against time and tide continues shining, standing, and guiding visitors home to Florida's oldest city.Watch ""Finding Florida"" each Sunday at 10 a.m. on WPTV!","https://www.wptv.com/finding-florida/st-augustine-lighthouse-225-000-visitors-annually-climb-for-best-view-in-all-of-florida"

This year, many diners opted for restaurant reservations and takeout instead of spending hours cooking at home.WATCH BELOW: New trend? Numbers show more people dining out on Thanksgiving Dining out becomes the new Thanksgiving trend for families Downtown Delray Beach was packed on Thanksgiving night, reflecting a nationwide shift. Several families said convenience, cost and lifestyle changes are reshaping how they approach the holiday.""We chose to go out on the town,"" said diner Briana Lutzi. ""Dining out is a good option,"" diner Kelsey Lutzi added. ""It's affordable, you can get any meal you want.""Christopher Bonilla, who is originally from New England, says the difference is striking. ""Up north, we do the traditional home family, home cooking, stay at home, traditional Thanksgiving dinner,"" Bonilla said. Celebrating in Florida feels different. ""I think it has something to do with the weather because it's warmer, people want to be out, 'Look at me, it's Thanksgiving, I’m biking; I just came from the beach,' It's a whole different environment,"" Bonilla said.The trend extends well beyond Florida. WPTV Restaurants in Delray Beach were busy serving diners on Thanksgiving.

Rahein Jones of True Vegan restaurant said this Thanksgiving was one of his busiest nights.""In a four-hour time frame, we made more in that four-hour time frame than we've done on days we've been open all day,"" Jones said. With fewer restaurants open on the holiday, demand grew quickly. ""People don't want to cook; people want good food, and they want someone to cook for them,"" Jones said.OpenTable listed 216 restaurants open in Delray Beach on Thanksgiving, underscoring how many families are moving away from traditional home gatherings.Some diners say the changes reflect deeper shifts in family life and culture. ""It's an interesting generation now. A lot of people aren't around family,"" said resident Briana Lutzi.Still, others believe the heart of the holiday remains unchanged. ""At the end of the day, what matters is you are with the people you love, and that love you, and you celebrate our country and our tradition together,"" said Bonilla.Researchers expect these trends to continue as younger generations take the lead on holiday planning and as food prices remain high.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fl. — Thanksgiving is a day of gratitude — a moment to recognize what and who carries us through the year. This year, people across South Florida spent that day serving others, handing out hot meals, warm smiles, and a little hope to those who need it most.At the corner of Atlantic and Fifth avenues in Delray Beach, Thanksgiving dinner looked a little different than most. There were no table settings or warm homes, yet gratitude was felt, and it was real.WATCH BELOW: Volunteers serve hope alongside Thanksgiving meals Volunteers in Delray Beach serve hope alongside Thanksgiving meals Hot meals came in Styrofoam containers — homemade and hand-delivered by Bill Caesar, a retired teacher who started the nonprofit Coming Back to Give Back. ""My mom, she was always a giver, and my aunt, they used to always give and help out,"" said Caesar. ""So we started this thing where we fed the homeless every Thursday, my mom and my aunt, and so when my mom, my aunt, they passed on, we just kept the tradition going. And, you know, we were always taught (that) if you have a chance, give back."" Now he comes for them — the people who know what it's like to live without life's essentials. They've gone without food, without shelter, without safety or stability. Here, a hot meal isn't routine — it's relief. A warm conversation isn't background noise — it's someone finally seeing you— and that wasn't taken for granted. ""I love to see them happy, you know, and they see me coming, and they know they're gonna get a hot meal. So I'm bringing delight to them. They bring joy to me. I'd say it's a blessing for both of us,"" said Caesar. For people like Fred and Paris, who are down on their luck, it wasn't just about the meal. It was connecting with a familiar face.Robert, now sleeping on that street, worked for 35 years. His disability checks no longer cover the cost of living. A hand-delivered plate he received on Thursday may be his first hot meal in a long time. It could be his last for a while, too.Sam once relied on SNAP benefits to keep him steady. Now he's not sure when or if the next meal will come.Rudy simply couldn't keep up with rent. The Delray Beach native was priced out of his own town.For people like Rolle, who is jobless and frustrated, sometimes someone just showing up can be enough to save.These are the stories we often don't hear. These are the moments we often don't see — moments of humanity both raw and inspiring. Moments of kindness that can both touch a life and transform it.Moments that teach us: when we pause and just listen, we hear fear, sure, and hunger, yes, but also resilience, humor and hope. We hear stories that put faces, voices and dignity back into a problem too often reduced to numbers.Sometimes just listening is the first step toward giving us all a reason to be grateful again.So as volunteers took their seats beside the people they call family, their Thanksgiving meal began.Though it may look different than others, every bite carried gratitude — and somehow— felt fuller than anything found at traditional tables.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
