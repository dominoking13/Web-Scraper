"Third version of Boca Raton downtown campus project revealed","MoneyReal Estate News Third version of Boca Raton downtown campus project revealed, residents weigh in City leaders are moving forward with having voters decide the fate of the project in the January special election One Boca Developers shared revised renderings after receiving collecting feedback. By: Zitlali Solache Posted and last updated BOCA RATON, Fla. — During Tuesday’s city council meeting, One Boca developers shared new plans for Boca’s downtown campus after several months of community pushback.This is the third version of the project and while a group of people were satisfied with the changes, many are still fighting against it altogether. Third version of Boca Raton downtown campus project revealed, residents weigh in “We’re so grateful for all of the community input that we’ve received. We’ve genuinely tried to incorporate everyone’s ideas to create a place we all could be proud of,” said Rob Frisbie Jr.Developers presented renderings including more green space, doubling recreation space from 7.6 to 15.4 acres, and shrinking leased land from 31 to 8 acres.“Aging infrastructure doesn’t preserve our heritage. It limits it. Redevelopment is how we honor our past and build a future that we need,” said resident Christina Broeker. “Let’s save Boca from Save Boca.”Some said the new plan keeps Boca’s character but members with Save Boca and many others want the project scratched.“All that glitters isn’t gold,” said Alex Pollock. “No matter how many different renderings we hear, no matter how many different proposals we see, the fundamental flaw with this entire plan is simply, why do we need to give away our public land to build apartments, condos and hotels?”Some argue East Boca has been negatively impacted by development and they don’t want any private developers involved.During the four-hour-long meeting, some city leaders also discussed two resolutions brought forth by the Save Boca citizen-led petitions.“Our great citizens rose to the occasion,” said Jon Pearlman, founder of Save Boca. “You [residents] stepped in and did what the mayor and city council should have.”While some city leaders were against the resolution language, they moved forward with placing an ordinance and charter amendment on the 2026 ballot that would call for a public vote for the sale/lease of any city-owned property larger than half an acre.The resolutions would allow voters to decide the fate of the project on the January 13th special election. Developers added the project has an estimated gross revenue of more than $3 billion. They will continue gathering feedback from the community.

Cars broke down, and countless individuals found themselves trapped in their homes as floodwaters surged higher.WATCH BELOW: 'I am very grateful,' Silvia Janson tells WPTVCity officials have been quick to provide insight into the scale of this natural disaster.""In all the history I have in storm water, we haven't seen an event like this in maybe 50 years,” explained Zachary Bihr, the Public Works and Engineering director of Boca Raton.During a Monday night city commission meeting, Bihr, along with City Manager Mark Sohaney, presented critical data regarding the storm's intensity.“It's approximately 1 billion gallons of water, that's somewhere between 25 and 30 football stadiums that fell in two hours; it is an immense amount of water,” Bihr said.The southeastern corner of Boca Raton was particularly hard-hit, recording upwards of 7 inches of rain.Sohaney reassured residents that ""our storm water system functioned exactly how it is designed. We're very grateful for that.""He noted that despite the overwhelming rainfall, the system worked effectively to clear most areas hours after the storm subsided, with crews working diligently overnight and into the following morning.Staff believes there may have been more flooding had it not been for their systems.City staff reported ongoing efforts to mitigate flood impacts, with crews surveying the aftermath and responding to calls for assistance. “Even for a city with a well-maintained stormwater system, this was pretty challenging in that short amount of time,” Sohaney acknowledged.Impact by the numbersAverage of 7 inches of rain in just 2 hours100 cars stranded due to flooding and needed towing60 storm-related calls to the police department100 calls to fire rescueNo major injuries reported.Residents of the Palm Beach Farms neighborhood struggled with the aftermath of the storm.Many found themselves unable to leave their homes as water levels rose significantly. ""My hope is that we get drainage, that all this is changing to something that we can all not be afraid every time a little rain falls down,"" expressed resident Silvia Janson, who was seen cleaning her yard of leaves and debris left by the floodwaters.When asked if she was finally able to leave her house, she joyfully replied, ""No, I can get out, I'm so happy.""WPTV addressed to Bihr on Monday the road within Palm Beach Farms that was still underwater, where we interviewed Janson.Later that evening, city crews responded to assist Janson and her neighbors. ""There were several trucks, and it was really loud; the water went, they took it with them,"" she noted, grateful for the quick response.Bihr assured residents during the Monday meeting that the city was assessing which areas required priority for infrastructure upgrades. Notably, plans are already in place for construction in Palm Beach Farms, set for spring 2026.

"Nonprofit prepares to help Jamaica following Hurricane Melissa","NewsPalm Beach County Palm Beach County nonprofit prepares to help Jamaica following Hurricane Melissa Free Spirit Outreach is working to send supplies and volunteers as the powerful Category 5 storm bears down on the Caribbean WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — As Jamaica endures the devastating impact of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa, a Palm Beach County based nonprofit is already taking action to provide relief.WATCH BELOW: 'We have teams on the ground that’s ready to go,' Lincoln Lewis tells WPTV's Cassandra Garcia Nonprofit prepares to help Jamaica following Hurricane Melissa Free Spirit Outreach is mobilizing teams and supplies to assist communities in Jamaica once the storm passes.“We have teams on the ground, big teams on the ground that’s ready to go,” said Lincoln Lewis, president of Free Spirit Outreach. “They’re protecting their families first and then they will be ready to go the moment it is safe to do so.”For Lewis, the storm’s potential devastation is personal. He lived through Jamaica’s last major hurricane, Gilbert, in 1988. “That changed my life and I know what it feels like when the storm passes and nothing is there anymore and everything is destroyed. Your life is up-rooted,” Lewis said.Lewis said the communities his organization serves are among the poorest in Jamaica, and their homes are often not built to withstand major hurricanes.“What they have are makeshift houses,” he said. “Those homes are not properly coded in terms of how their designed.”Free Spirit Outreach also provided relief in Jamaica after Hurricane Beryl struck last year. This time, Lewis said the organization is preparing to send a shipping container full of supplies on Friday, along with more than a dozen volunteers.“They will start bringing out food and distribution, care packages to people who are severely impacted,” Lewis said.Although the full extent of Hurricane Melissa’s impact remains uncertain, Lewis said the need for aid will likely be significant. He’s calling on the Palm Beach County community to contribute through donations or volunteer work.For more information on how to help, visit Free Spirit Outreach’s website or contact the organization directly.Portions of this story were assisted by artificial intelligence tools and reviewed by a WPTV journalists to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to editorial standards.

"Palm Beach fights federal no-fly zone over Mar-a-Lago","NewsTrump Palm Beach fights federal no-fly zone over Mar-a-Lago Restrictions set to last until at least 2026 ( ) (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) An aerial view of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Aug. 31, 2022. By: Kayla McDermott Posted PALM BEACH, Fla. — Palm Beach officials are pushing back against a new federal no-fly zone over Mar-a-Lago that has residents complaining about constant aircraft noise, even when President Donald Trump isn't home.The no-fly zone went into effect just over a week ago and now runs around the clock. WATCH BELOW: Palm Beach fights federal no-fly zone over Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach fights federal no-fly zone over Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach Mayor Danielle Moore has filed a formal complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration, voicing concerns about excessive aircraft noise, emergency response delays, and lack of transparency and justification for the restrictions.""Do I want to hear additional noise from the jets? No,"" said one Flamingo Park resident who lives north of Mar-a-Lago. The restrictions are set to last until at least 2026. Palm Beach County Commissioner Gregg Weiss is teaming up with Moore on the issue. ""People are questioning why, when (Trump's) not there, is this being imposed?"" Weiss said.But former Secret Service agent Timothy Miller said federal agencies feel the restrictions are necessary. ""Remember that this is the most threatened president, I think, in our lifetime,"" Miller said. ""The potential for drones being utilized, that's a serious threat, and so I think it's reasonable now.""Before he was elected president, Trump had similar concerns about aircraft noise. He sued Palm Beach International Airport three times to try and change the flight path north of Mar-a-Lago. Court records show lawsuits in 1995, 2010 and 2015 all had similar complaints. The suits claimed Mar-a-Lago was damaged by ""corrosive bombardment"" of ""noise, vibrations, fumes, pollution and other emissions from the aircraft approach and departing the airport"".Now, residents are making similar complaints about their homes.""I definitely hear the sonic issues,"" said Julian Ford, who also lives in Flamingo Park.In all cases, Trump withdrew his lawsuits. But when he was first elected president in 2016, the FAA enacted its first no-fly zone over Mar-a-Lago when he was staying at the property. Residents said they are fine with the flight restrictions when the president is in town.""When he's not here, we should have our peace and quiet back,"" said Jason Fitzhugh, another Flamingo Park resident.To have their voices heard, Weiss said there is a meeting scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 6, at 6 p.m. at Palm Beach International Airport's administration office. The public may also submit noise comments using an online form or by calling the airport's Noise Abatement Office at 561-683-7242.""We're not stepping away. We're stepping right into it,"" Weiss said. However, Miller does not believe the meeting will change much. ""With these new and emerging threats, you have to have proactive security measures,"" Miller said.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

An interim city manager will take over immediately.Mortell defended himself during the meeting, pushing back on allegations and thanking his supporters before leaving the room.""I know I sound a little frustrated, and I am.
