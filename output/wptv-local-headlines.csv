He even tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen when the conviction was read.Routh represented himself in court. His daughter explained why.“We're not rich, we don't have funds, we don't have the means to hire a private attorney,” she said. “He felt like he was back against the wall, and he felt like he was the only one that could get his message across. He has no law education, no background, not even Law Library to, like reference to or anything.”Despite the conviction, she insists the fight isn’t over, as she makes a plea for help.“I will appeal,” said Routh. “I am looking for any and everybody that is willing to stand behind me and my father, to find a way to appeal this case.”“We figured there'd be a lot more support,” she added.Former Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg told Hoffman there could be grounds for an appeal.“It is legitimate grounds for appeal that the judge should never have allowed Ryan Routh to represent himself,” said Aronberg.""I would say that that has a greater chance of succeeding on appeal than he ever had in gaining an acquittal in this case.”“I still think it's an uphill climb for Routh to win on appeal,” Aronberg added.“I think he's going to end up dying in prison. I think he'll get life in prison and he’s done, but there's always that chance that, because he is so erratic, because he clearly had no idea of what he was doing as his own lawyer, that he could claim there was a Sixth Amendment violation of his right to a fair trial, even though he was the one who made the decision from the beginning.”“Our family is going through a lot,” Sara said.“I am open to talk to anybody willing to help us.”Routh will be sentenced on December 18th, court documents say his deadline for appeal comes within two weeks of his sentencing. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-st-lucie-county/fort-pierce/exclusive-ryan-rouths-daughter-speaks-out-after-trump-assassination-attempt-conviction-plans-appeal"
"Delray Beach explores Pride intersection replacements","NewsLGBTQ+ Delray Beach considers new ways to honor LGBTQ+ community after Pride intersection removal WPTV's Khalil McLean By: Ange Toussaint Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Delray Beach is considering new ways to honor the LGBTQ+ community after the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) removed the city’s Pride intersection.City commissioners kicked off the conversation at a recent commission meeting, laying out new ideas and ways for residents to collaborate.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Delray Beach considers new ways to honor LGBTQ+ community after Pride intersection removal Among the suggestions: a commemorative plaque, renaming the intersection to Pride Street, adding street pole banners, murals at Old School Square garage and a rainbow light projection on the water tower.“I would rather try to get this sooner rather than later to try to get this off our agenda, ” Mayor Tom Carney said.The move comes as Delray Beach recently decided to end its fight against the state over the rainbow intersection.On Aug. 15, 2025, FDOT issued a directive ordering the city to remove the mural, citing safety issues. FDOT painted over the Pride intersection on Sept. 9, 2025, after the city failed to remove it. Delray officials initially said they would fight the issue but later decided to back down due to funding risks.Now, city leaders say the matter should be left up to residents.“I think we should allow the residents to decide how and what this looks like. We don’t need three meetings on this subject,” Commissioner Juli Casale said.“I think so long as you do things legally, put up signs legally, or banners legally, so long as everything is done in a correct way, then have at it,” said Delray Beach resident, Edward Scherer.But questions came up on how commissioners would fund the effort. They could not agree on whether it should be paid for with public funds or through private donors.“This commission decided to rescind that vote, with the caveat that we were gonna redirect those funds towards this project,” Vice Mayor Rob Long said.Delray Beach says it plans to hold a public meeting and launch a survey to help make a decision. Long urged fellow commissioners to act quickly.“I frankly think a bold gesture is needed at this point. I really do.

"'It's affecting all of us': Families share fallout of immigration enforcement","CommunityLet's Hear It Let's Hear It: Families share fallout of immigration enforcement WPTV's Joel Lopez is listening to viewers' concerns over the increasing deportations and heightened fear affecting families in the area WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Many of you came to WPTV's ""Let's Hear It"" event on Tuesday at the Esperanza Center in West Palm Beach.It's a crucial platform welcoming the community to share personal stories and experiences.WATCH BELOW: 'I’m very thankful for WPTV for being here, because through you our voices can be heard,' Lidia Perez says Families share fallout of immigration enforcement Top of mind, for some who attended, is the profound impact immigration policies are having on the community. Attendees voiced their concerns over the increasing deportations and heightened fear affecting families in the area.One voice that stood out during the event was that of Alida Gomez, a mother of two and a newborn. ""The situation we're living in with immigration isn't secure,"" she shared in Spanish. ""Yes, it's affecting all of us a lot, all of us."" Gomez opened up about the heartbreaking implications of these crackdowns, revealing how they have torn her family apart.In June, Gomez received a life-altering phone call from her husband, while she was seven months pregnant.He informed her that his landscaping truck had been pulled over by law enforcement, leading to his detention.Her husband was the breadwinner while she finished her pregnancy and cared for the kids.""How do you explain something like that to your children?"" WPTV's Joel Lopez asked. The emotional weight of her response was palpable.""It was so difficult. They would see me cry and ask 'Mom, what's happening? Mommy, what's happening?' At one point I had to explain to them that they took Daddy; it's going to be just us.""Gomez said her husband was taken to the Alligator Alcatraz detention center and eventually deported back to Guatemala, leaving her to care for her two kids, and their baby girl that was born months later.""When we came here from Guatemala, we wanted to make something of ourselves, we wanted to get ahead. Now I'm struggling with the kids,"" she expressed. ""I go outside in fear, I take my children to school in fear; when I leave the house, I bring my kids because if something happens, I know they'll be with me.""Her family relied on organizations like the Esperanza Center for help with necessities like food and diapers. Now, Gomez is planning to move to Guatemala to reunite with her husband and family.""We don't feel safe here,"" said Gomez.The Esperanza Center has been dedicated to supporting all members of the community in need for six years, providing educational resources, food, and supplies while encouraging local families to connect and pay it forward.""The way that we get stronger is we come together as a community,"" said Patrick Williams, whose wife, Maricela Torres, is the executive director of the center. ""Everybody can help out in different ways; it's not always money; it's volunteering, it's supporting the organization in different ways as far as sponsorship.""Williams emphasized the importance of community involvement. “This organization is here to support the community, and it’s done on the backs of people that have seen the vision and supported it, and it continues to do great things,” he said.The center is actively seeking donations and support from community members of all backgrounds to expand their resources.However, there’s a palpable sense of loss within the local community, as staff at Esperanza reported a 30% drop in the immigrant population nearby since the onset of stricter enforcement policies.They could not say if the loss is from people who moved away, were deported, or are in hiding.Local cosmetologist Lidia Perez addressed this issue, sharing the emotional toll it’s taken on families. ""I have a 10-year-old son who said, 'Mom, my classmate isn't going to come back to school, because his dad was deported and he has to move,'"" Perez recounted. ""Imagine hearing that. It impacted me, because I have kids, and I can't imagine my children not being by our side.""She noted the stark difference in the street corners of West Palm Beach, which were once bustling with workers waiting for job opportunities. ""There used to be so many workers. I would pass by every day going to work. If I go by now, they're gone. Why? Because they're afraid that they'll be deported. So think about it, how are those families surviving?"" Perez urged the community to support food kitchens and organizations that assist families in need.""I’m very thankful for WPTV for being here, because through you our voices can be heard, so thank you,"" Perez concluded, reminding everyone of the importance of ensuring that their stories reach a larger audience.WPTV wanted to look into the overall impact of immigration enforcement and found new data from the Department of Homeland Security.DOH numbers shed light on the recent actions taken against undocumented immigrants.As of now, over 2 million illegal migrants have been removed from the U.S., with 1.6 million choosing to self-deport, while over 400,000 have been deported.More than 200,000 deportations are expected by the end of the year. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/community/lets-hear-it/lets-hear-it-families-share-fallout-of-immigration-enforcement"

This time, farther north near the FPL Access Road on Warfield Boulevard.For 22 years, Forrest Yingling lived near SR-710. He said he’s not surprised.“It's par for the course,” said Yingling. “Bloody 710, they call it.”Just next door, Heather Daniel Smith said it’s personal.“Two of my friends were killed on this road,” said Smith.Neighbor said the problem is drivers trying to pass cars on the two-lane stretch of Warfield Boulevard from Indiantown to Okeechobee.“If there's a car going slow, people are killing themselves to get around them, “ said Smith. ‘They're passing on double yellow lines the passing lane.”A solution, for some neighbors, is to make the SR-710 4 lanes, just as it is south into Palm Beach County.“Where slower cars could get to the one side and people could pass safely,” said Smith.Martin County Sheriff Jon Budensiek said it’s one of the most dangerous roads in Martin County, per capita.Budenseik said they’ve heard neighbors' concerns and dedicated members with their traffic unit to the roadway.Since 2022, there have been over 1,0063 crashes on Warfield Boulevard, ten of them deadly.Budensiek said deputies have issued around 3200 tickets in the past year.“That's a lot of citations for that road, probably more than any other road, per capita” said Budensiek.Budensiek also supports widening the Warfield Boulevard.“It's not the county's responsibility,” said Sheriff Budensiek. “It's FDOT’s responsibility to fix that road.”WPTV took their concerns to FDOT, and they say in a statement:“The Department reviews all fatal crashes to find ways to improve safety. “A spokesperson with FDOT also told WPTV they developed multiple plans to enhance safety along SR-710.Those include intersection improvements at SW Warfield Boulevard and CR-714, which consisted of installing additional signage (including LED-lit signs) and pavement markings.Work was completed in late spring 2024.FDOT said earlier this year that they completed adding a westbound left-turn lane at the intersection of SR-710 and SW Tommy Clements Street. The department started working on an eastbound right turn lane at the intersection, which is expected to be completed in Spring 2026.As for widening SR-710 to four lanes, FDOT said they’re in the design phase for widening the road from SE 126 Boulevard to SW Van Buren Avenue. FDOT said the right-of-way phase is funded starting in Fiscal Year 2027.FDOT said Construction for SE 126th Boulevard (Okeechobee County) to Allapatah Road is not funded in the Department’s five-year work program for Fiscal Year 2026-2030, estimated at $248 million.However, Construction from Allapattah Road to SW Van Buren Ave. is funded in Fiscal Year 2030, estimated at is $16.9 million, according to FDOT.But neighbors fear more crashes could happen before then.“We're just falling through the cracks,” said Smith. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-martin-county/bloody-710-neighbors-want-solution-for-sr-710-after-2-double-fatal-crashes-on-tuesday"
"Why was Routh allowed to defend himself during trial?","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyFort Pierce Why was Ryan Routh allowed to defend himself during Trump attempted assassination trial? Routh was ruled competent enough to represent himself, but tried to kill himself with a pen after verdict Lothar Speer This courtroom sketch shows U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon listening to Ryan Routh during his trial where he is charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump last year at a golf course in South Florida, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025, in Fort Pierce, Fla. By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — A legal expert is questioning Ryan Routh's ability to represent himself after new court records reveal the dozens of exhibits he wanted to show the jury as evidence in the case.Routh was found guilty of trying to assassinate Donald Trump in September 2024, along with four other related charges. He now faces the possibility of life in prison.WATCH BELOW: Why was Routh allowed to defend himself during trial? Why was Ryan Routh allowed to defend himself during Trump attempted assassination trial? Routh was allowed to represent himself as his own defense attorney.However, his defense only lasted less than three hours after a judge ruled his exhibits of evidence and witnesses couldn't be introduced to the jury.Judge Aileen Cannon ruled these pieces of evidence were irrelevant to the trial and were submitted past the discovery deadline.They include Routh's autobiography called ""Not My America"", a letter to the leaders of North Korea, various items related to his time in Ukraine, pieces of a skate park, various haikus, locker shelves he built, as well as his Eagle Scout application and dozens of other items.Court records show a lot of Routh's witnesses were character witnesses, which were mostly ruled irrelevant to the case.Attorney Michelle Suskauer told WPTV these pieces of evidence would have never been allowed in a courtroom. She said Routh's attempts to present this evidence are proof he doesn't understand the rules of evidence proficient enough to overcome her efforts.""He's not familiar with the rules of federal criminal procedure, and he's not an experienced attorney, so that is certainly a detriment to him and his defense,"" Suskauer said.Routh also stabbed himself with a pen after the verdict was read Tuesday afternoon. WPTV reporter Kate Hussey saw U.S. Marshals tackle Routh as his daughter screamed in the back of the courtroom. Ryan Routh tries to stab self with pen after guilty verdict Cannon allowed Routh to represent himself after a hearing earlier this year.The hearing occurred after Routh asked the court to represent himself, which is his constitutional right under the 6th Amendment, and also requested his public defenders be removed from the case.Cannon said Routh's forensic evaluation referenced that he had mixed personality features, but didn't impede his ability to knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to counsel.The judge also used an eight-factor test to make the decision, which included:Defendant's age, health and educationDefendant's contact with lawyers prior to trialDefendant's knowledge of the nature of the charges and possible defenses and penaltiesDefendant's understanding of the rules of evidence, procedure and courtroom decorumDefendant's experience in criminal trialsWhether standby counsel was appointed and, if so, the extent to which standby counsel aided in the trialAny mistreatment or coercion of the defendantWhether the defendant was attempting to manipulate the trialRegardless, Cannon repeatedly reprimanded Routh to follow the rules of evidence during the trial and asked questions to ensure he would follow the rules.There were also consequences for not following the rules, including Routh's opening and closing statement being cut short, sudden calls for impromptu breaks and Routh occasionally appearing intimidated to object or challenge government prosecutors.At one point during closing arguments, Routh even asked to reinstate his public defender. However, Cannon denied that request.

Their struggles seemed to follow the Food and Drug Administration’s updated recommendations, which limit vaccine access to people at least 65 years old or those younger but with certain health conditions and a prescription from their doctor.Still, Floridians we‘ve spoken with haven’t been able to get the shot.“I tried online at CVS, Walgreens, Publix, Costco, but nothing,” a Tampa woman told us earlier this month.Stephen Stanford of Venice said he would be willing to go wherever he needed to so he and his partner could get the booster. His partner has severe lung disease. This past Friday, things became murkier when a CDC vaccine advisory panel also recommended limiting the vaccine.Though Florida’s surgeon general has publicly denounced the vaccine, despite numerous requests, his office had declined to weigh in on whether the shot would even be available to Florida, that is, until now.In his post on Tuesday on X, the Surgeon General called the vaccine ""unsafe"" and ""not fit for human use,” but he added, “the decision to administer them at a pharmacy rests in the hands of the pharmacist or pharmacy. FDOH is not involved in this decision,” he posted.Here is what we know right now on COVID-19 vaccine availability in Florida:Publix started making the shot available to eligible patients Tuesday. Walgreens is offering the vaccine but with restrictions, so you'll want to check with your local store. At CVS locations, the vaccine is also available to eligible patients. (Some viewers have told us that even though they’re over 65, they still needed to present a prescription) If you are interested in getting the vaccine, your best bet is to contact your local pharmacy first. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/wptv-investigates/its-a-hoax-fls-surgeon-general-attempts-to-clear-up-confusion-over-covid-vaccine-availability-in-florida"

Stokus said the delay could be a benefit.“My first grant application, I was trying to get $45 million from a total pot of $750 million,” said Stokus.Now, the county is asking for $45 million from a larger pool of funds.“I believe our odds will be much greater of being awarded the station,” said Stokus.The county said they will have the option to withdraw from the agreement if the grants fall through.Some people have expressed concern over the price tag, but Stokus said he supports Brightline.“When you look at the length of time it's going to take, having a project of this size and magnitude is well worth the wait,” said Stokus.If they get the funds, Stokus said it’ll take about 18 months for the new station.Read more of WPTV's coverage below: Region Martin County AGREEMENT DERAILED: Could Martin County sue Stuart for pulling out of deal?

Why couldn't I reapply?"" she said. Real Estate News My Safe Florida Home: You had questions, and we got answers Matt Sczesny According to the statute covering the program, homeowners have one year, with an extra six months, to finish all the improvements in the application or the application is considered abandoned.Re-applying later is only accepted under three exceptions:a. The original grant application was denied or withdrawn because the application contained errors or omissionsb. The original grant application was denied or withdrawn because the home did not meet the eligibility criteria for a grant at the time of the previous application, and the homeowner reasonably believes that the home now is eligible for a grantc. The program's eligibility requirements for a grant have changed since the original application date, and the applicant reasonably believes that he or she is an eligible homeowner under the new requirements""We'll see if we have a place to get a second look at some of these people,"" said state Rep. Peggy Gossett-Seidman, R-Highland Beach. ""I think there could be a legislative fix because this would be the result of running a very tight, efficient program and not allowing a few people to fall by the wayside.""The bottom line is that homeowners need to know that if they back away from a grant, the My Safe Florida Home program will lock them out in the future, so be careful.
