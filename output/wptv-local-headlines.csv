Lines stretched as people waited for groceries. Hagen said the organization is bracing for what's to come.""We have been noticing this week about a 10-15% uptick in new registrations, and the crisis hasn't even started yet,"" he said.On Friday, federal judges ruled that it was unlawful for the government to suspend SNAP benefits.

"Nonprofits brace for surge in need as federal shutdown halts SNAP benefits","NewsTreasure Coast Nonprofits brace for surge in need as federal shutdown halts SNAP benefits As SNAP benefits lapse, families turn to local nonprofits for help, but those groups say their shelves and budgets are already stretched thin WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted FORT PIERCE, Fla. — As the federal government shutdown continues, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits officially ran out Saturday, leaving millions of Americans struggling to afford food.Local nonprofits like Mustard Seed Ministries and Chasin A Dream Foundation say the loss of benefits is creating a wave of impact.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Nonprofits brace for surge in need as federal shutdown halts SNAP benefits Stephanie Kingsbury, executive director of Mustard Seed Ministries, said the organization is preparing for a potential surge in clients.“That causes an even greater strain on the already strained resources that we have,” she said.For Scher Louis, a mother and SNAP recipient, the impact of losing benefits is deeply personal. Louis said she relies on food assistance to stay afloat as she cares for her son, who is battling cancer.“[It's] not just a handout. It feels like a lifeline,” Louis said. “When we weren’t able to make ends meet, they were there to fill in the gaps and make sure that my family, my kids had nutritious meals.”Over the weekend, Louis received a financial boost from the Chasin A Dream Foundation, a local nonprofit that provides aid to families of children battling life-threatening illnesses and disabilities.“Right now, we’re going to focus and make sure everyone has the food,” said Lori Griffith, the organization’s executive director.Griffith said the foundation can continue providing assistance for the next several weeks, but the shift in funding comes at a cost. “That will take from other programs that we have,” she said.Both Kingsbury and Griffith say they expect the coming days to be challenging.“Families go under so quickly,” Griffith said. “You take SNAP out of the picture now and the immediate ripple effects — they’re devastating.”Kingsbury echoed that concern. “People are concerned about if there's going to be enough food because there are so many people that will be impacted by this,” she said.Both nonprofits are calling on the community for donations to help bridge the gap until federal aid resumes.

The Boca Raton mother spent two years fighting allegations that prosecutors dismissed citing new evidence just weeks before her trial was set to begin. By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A Boca Raton mother accused of child sex crimes has been cleared of all charges after prosecutors dismissed the case, citing new evidence that emerged just two weeks before her trial was set to begin.Walquiria Cassini, 40, was arrested in March 2024 along with her fiancé, Ryan Londono, and her then-20-year-old son Matthew. WATCH BELOW: Local mother exonerated after child sex crimes arrest Mother exonerated after child sex crimes arrest in 2024 They faced allegations of sexually abusing Cassini's children and livestreaming the abuse for financial gain over five years.The Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office filed a dismissal document Thursday, stating ""new information brought to the state's attention"" led to the decision to drop all charges.""I love my children, I would never, ever hurt them. That did not happen in my home. I am innocent,"" Cassini said in an exclusive one-on-one interview with WPTV. Case began during custody dispute Cassini and her attorneys, Mac Kenzie Sacks and Matthew Goldberger of South Florida Justice, say the sexual abuse allegations stemmed from a bitter custody dispute over Thanksgiving 2023. Cassini said the father of her two children never returned them after the holiday, despite promising to do so.Text messages WPTV obtained show Cassini messaging her ex-husband dozens of times on Nov. 26, asking where her children were and threatening to call the police. Her messages went unanswered until the next day, when she finally called 911.Body camera footage from Nov. 27 showed Marion County deputies responding to her ex's home in Ocala after he reported the allegations. However, hours later, Palm Beach County deputies questioned his claims.""It's possible that the kids are just lying about this because they want to stay with dad, because dad hasn't witnessed any of this,"" a Marion County deputy told Palm Beach County deputies in body camera footage. ""This was reported to him two days ago, but he didn't call us until tonight. He's more concerned with keeping his kids than he is with the actual allegations."" Detective under investigation The arresting Palm Beach County sheriff's detective, in the arrest affidavit, claimed to have found sex toys, suspicious payments and an adult website account tied to Cassini's IP address, with files deleted the day after the investigation began.In court motions, Cassini's attorneys accused the detective of fabricating evidence, saying the website never had accounts linked to Cassini, the sex toys were unrelated, and the FBI found no child exploitation material on any of her 56 devices.""The sensational probable cause affidavit that was authored was authored to generate headlines, not to reflect facts or evidence,"" Sacks said. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office confirmed the detective is now the subject of an internal affairs investigation.Cassini's attorneys also noted that the children and their father refused medical examinations. ""We really feel like they are victims here of manipulation,"" said Goldberger. Moving forward without her children After reviewing digital evidence, depositions and witnesses, prosecutors said the state ""no longer has a good faith basis to proceed.""""Relieved, happy obviously, but I'm also a little sad too, because you think about this day forever,"" Cassini said, breaking down during the interview. ""I kept imagining myself in a courtroom, and then they give me the not guilty, my kids would come. But that's not what happens here.""Cassini still doesn't have custody of her children, who remain with their father. She lost her job, friends and reputation during the two-year ordeal.""Obviously, I want my story told. I know there's going to be people that probably don't believe it,"" Cassini said. ""That part is tough, but I'm willing to share the story if it helps somebody else in the future and prevents this from happening to anybody.""Cassini is now preparing for a legal battle to reunite with her children. Attempts to reach the children's father for comment were unsuccessful.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

"Why business owners here are pushing for a pedestrian-only area","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach Business owners on Clematis Street in downtown West Palm Beach push for a pedestrian-only area amid struggles 'I think the rents in this area are very high, and we don't have enough traffic,' business owner Michele Holmes says WPTV For Lease sign on building along Clematis Street in downtown West Palm Beach on Oct. 31, 2025 By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A group of businesses on Clematis Street said they are pushing West Palm Beach to create more pedestrian-only streets.These businesses, specifically located on the 500 block of the city's historic main street, are making the argument to city leaders after an increase in turnover on the strip. WPTV has noticed an increase in empty storefronts and ""for lease signs"" along Clematis Street compared to a few months ago.WATCH BELOW: Business owners along Clematis St. push for pedestrian-only area Clematis Street business owners push for pedestrian-friendly zone Michele Holmes, who owns a mini market selling everything from groceries to mosquito repellent wipes, is among the business owners advocating for the change. She said high rents in the area, along with other costs, like insurance, mean she has to relocate to a different spot on the same block to keep her doors open.""We don't see enough families,"" Holmes said about the current state of the area. ""It just starts to be cumbersome, you know, where your profits are lower than what you need to survive.""She said businesses see a 30% to 35% increase in sales when the city closes down the 500 block for various events.A city-commissioned consultant recently created a report examining ways to improve walkability and bike access along the downtown waterfront area. However, those recommendations focused primarily on areas closer to the waterfront rather than Clematis Street.Read the full consultant report below:WPTV asked the city if it had any concerns about businesses in the downtown area. A city spokesperson said they are looking at ways to promote businesses across the city.""We are interested in the viability of businesses throughout our City,"" the spokesperson said. ""Each day, our economic development team researches ways to promote the health of businesses throughout the City.""The spokesperson also said it did not have plans to create additional pedestrian-only areas in the Clematis Waterfront District.WPTV also noticed on Friday several shops and restaurants have opened along Clematis Street over the last six months, like Skinny Louie and Crema Gourmet Espresso Bar. There are also locations under construction that have taken years, like Pubbelly Sushi and Bacon Bitch, the latter of which eventually went out of business.One of those business trying to move into Clematis Street is Arya Tea Bar, which said it would open in Fall 2025. However, the tea store is still not open as of November. Its owner posted a video on Instagram asking people to do their ""permit rain dance"" when discussing a pause in construction that lasted a few weeks.""This is something that I was warned about and tried to do everything I could in advance to make sure we were moving forward,"" said Sophie DeWaal. ""But, the reality is it's just the system. ... Basically, you send it in and it takes five days for somebody to look at it, who isn’t the person who needs to review it, and then that person that routes it to the people who need to review it.""When WPTV reached out to DeWaal, who left a career on Wall Street to start the company in West Palm Beach, she said she had a pretty smooth time getting permits and called the city ""incredibly"" helpful. She also said the city gave her a grant to assist with her build-out.""I believe I've posted about one 3-week delay related to permits, but that's not bad at all in the scheme of things, and we will be opening quite close to my original plan,"" wrote DeWaal.A city spokesperson said it doesn't believe it has a permit problem stopping businesses from thriving in the downtown area.""West Palm Beach is known for being one of the governmental entities in Palm Beach County that processes permits the fastest,"" said the spokesperson.
