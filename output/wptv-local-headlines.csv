Jonny Castro WPTV By: Zitlali Solache Posted INDIAN RIVER COUNTY, Fla. — A Pennsylvania artist is honoring Sgt. Terri Sweeting-Mashkow, through a moving tribute — a powerful painting inspired by her service and sacrifice.Jonny Castro created the piece, and he is a police officer and forensic composite artist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Pennsylvania artists creates painting for fallen IRCSO deputy Castro has created more than 2,000 portraits of fallen first responders, and his most recent is Sgt. Sweeting-Mashkow’s.“What makes it so special is just the fact that she was given that sergeant rank for giving her life in the line of duty,” said Castro. “Her selfless service and her heroism.”Sgt. Sweeting Mashkow was shot and killed Friday while serving an eviction notice in the Bermuda Club Community off A1A. Castro ties in his roles as a police officer and forensic composite artist into his work.“You’re constantly working, constantly drawing facial features, so about 10 years ago, coming up on 10 years, I did my first one and everybody seemed to enjoy it,” said Castro.He said after learning about Sgt. Sweeting Mashkow’s tragedy, he was deeply moved. He learned about it on social media and immediately began sketching.“It’s sad to think that she was on the job for 25 years,” said Castro.He also created a portrait for the three fallen Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office deputies last year.“What do you hope loved ones say or feel when they see this portrait that you created?” asked WPTV’s Zitlali Solache.“I hope they know there are people like me all the way up in Pennsylvania and as far west as California that are praying for her family and wishing them the best during this tragic time — especially around the holidays,’ replied Castro.The goal is for the art to be a piece that the family holds dearly. Castro said he will also begin sketching David Long’s piece on Tuesday. Long is the locksmith also involved in the fatal eviction call.“I think that’s what makes it special, just because she doesn’t have any photos. She will never have a photo as a sergeant,’ said Castro. “This may be the only one, so I just hope to know the family enjoys it and they hang it proud on their wall.”Castro says he will be in touch with Sheriff Eric Flowers to ship the painting over.","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-indian-river-county/pennsylvania-artists-creates-painting-for-fallen-ircso-deputy"

So we try to make it so that way different generations are able to experience it,” Westridge said.Westridge said the most meaningful part of the trip is giving her dancers a chance to take part in an American tradition recognized nationwide.“The most exciting part about this is that our dancers get to be a part of a timeless tradition that everyone knows about.

Now the community is rallying around her effort to help families, seniors and anyone struggling to make ends meet WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted FORT PIERCE, Fla. — A teenager in the Lakewood Park community is making a big impact with a small pantry outside her family’s home. What began as a simple idea during the government shutdown has grown into a bustling, free food pantry that’s drawing gratitude and support from across Fort Pierce.17-year-old Chloe Tucker said she launched the pantry when families temporarily lost access to SNAP benefits during the government shutdown.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Fort Pierce teen’s free food pantry becomes lifeline for neighbors in need “It’s a way for someone to get food that they can’t normally get and I believe everyone should have access to that,” Tucker said.The shelves are stocked with nonperishable foods and hygiene items staples Tucker says many people can’t always afford.As the pantry has grown, so has the feedback from residents who rely on it. Tucker keeps a collection of handwritten thank-you notes, each a reminder of how far her effort reaches.“These are little notes that we’ve gotten in our recommendations notes areas. [One says], ‘Mom of 7. Such a blessing. Happy holidays,’” she said.Our Cassandra Garcia asked Tucker how those messages make her feel.“It’s nice, it makes me realize that just because I’m doing this and I’m helping a couple of people, it’s helping a lot more people because I’m helping their family, their kids, the people that love them,” Tucker said.Among the visitors Wednesday morning were Richard and Jeanette Chausse, who say fixed incomes and rising prices are hitting seniors particularly hard.“We bring stuff home and then we bring it to other people in our neighborhood because we live in a 55+ community and there’s a lot of people that can’t get out of their homes, so we bring it to them,” Jeanette Chausse said.Tucker’s mother, Amanda, said the response has been overwhelming.“I didn’t expect it to take off the way that it did, as fast as it did. It makes me not only proud of her, but the community,” she said.“It’s great to see how well a community can come together to help one another just to help one another when they all see what good it could do,” Chloe added.The pantry is located at 6803 Citrus Park Boulevard in Fort Pierce. It's filled with items such as lentils, beans, jasmine rice and holiday stuffing, along with hygiene essentials. Tucker restocks it using overflow supplies stored inside her home, but says keeping up with demand will take the community's help, especially during the holiday season.“This over here is our overflow pile, we have a lot of canned goods, hygiene products. We are looking for more hygiene products, specifically soaps and shampoos,” she said.For Tucker, the effort is all about giving back to the neighborhood she cares so much about.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-st-lucie-county/fort-pierce/fort-pierce-teens-free-food-pantry-becomes-lifeline-for-neighbors-in-need"

Three incidents reported at same store. By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — West Palm Beach police are investigating three separate incidents where a man allegedly used artificial intelligence to create fake videos to manipulate shoppers at the Palm Beach Lakes Home Depot. The latest case occurred Nov. 18, when police say a 22-year-old man showed a woman a realistic AI-generated image of her husband kissing another woman. The video was completely fabricated. ""I just felt violated — that was the worst part and hardest part to get over,"" the woman said. She and her husband asked not to be identified, fearing retaliation since the suspect is not in custody.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Police investigate AI video manipulation attempts at Palm Beach Lakes Home Depot Body camera footage shows West Palm Beach officers responding to the Home Depot that night. In it, the suspect, whose identity is being withheld because he has not been charged, showed officers the AI generated image of her husband, admitting he showed it to the woman and recorded her reaction on his Meta glasses.""What crime did I commit?"" asks the man in the body camera video. ""Well, there's been several,"" replies the Home Depot manager on duty. ""That's all I showed her, that's it,"" says the 22-year-old, holding up the phone. ""Oh, it's an AI thing, is that what it is?"" asks the officer. ""It's an AI prank,"" the man being questioned replies."" ""I just wanted to get away from him, and I think my anxiety grew after the whole thing was over,"" the woman targeted said.She and her husband filed a police report, and officers are investigating whether this incident is connected to two similar cases at the same store. In October, Melanie Valentine told WPTV a man showed her a realistic AI video of her truck being stolen, then tried to convince her to leave with him to ""catch the guy.""""It was really scary because you start to think about all of the things that could have possibly happened. Maybe they would have ambushed me when I was getting out of the truck,"" Valentine said.When WPTV showed both Valentine and the couple from the November incident a photo of the man in the body camera footage, they identified him as the person that approached them. Home Depot's manager told police the suspect had been there before. ""The minute you walked in we were notified by our facial recognition. You were doing this weeks ago here,"" the manager said in the body camera footage. West Palm Beach Police spokesperson Rachel Leitao said investigators suspect the incidents were created for social media content.""We do suspect that these are just shock value videos for social media purposes,"" Leitao said. ""The idea that somebody’s creating these fake videos to instill fear in someone is unacceptable, we know of actually three incidents very similar in nature that have occurred."" The department is now asking any other potential victims to come forward. Criminal defense attorney Stuart Kaplan said while filming someone in public is legal, using AI to manipulate someone's image with criminal intent could lead to legal action.""It may fall into the arena civil defamation or slander, or perhaps if it's then used to try to extort you or to blackmail you, or even worse, then obviously law enforcement would have a right to investigate,"" Kaplan said.However, using someone's likeness in AI videos without clear criminal intent remains a legal gray area, Kaplan said.""Do you think there should be stronger laws surrounding the use of AI?"" Investigative Reporter Kate Hussey asked Kaplan. ""One thousand percent,"" Kaplan replied. ""If AI is manipulated or falls into the wrong hands, it can present a very, very troubling and damaging scenario for our way of life."" Police advise shoppers to be on high alert during the busy holiday shopping season. If something feels off, trust your instincts and never go with a stranger.The investigation is ongoing.

Meanwhile, Democrats argue families are still getting crushed by premiums for homes, condos and cars, fueling what they call the state’s true affordability crisis. Property insurance, not property taxes, becomes Democrats' rallying cry CFO Ingoglia says reforms are paying off Florida CFO Blaise Ingoglia, a Republican, sat down with Scripps Capitol reporter Forrest Saunders and defended the state’s overhaul of insurance litigation and fraud rules, saying the changes are now producing real results.""When you look at the reforms that we did three years ago, clearly the reforms are working,"" Ingoglia said.He pointed to major auto insurance shifts as proof.""There is an excessive profit statute on the books, and Progressive had to give back $1 billion worth of extra profits back to the policyholders on auto policies,"" Ingoglia said. ""State Farm reduction 10%, so we're seeing drastic movement in the auto insurance market.""While acknowledging homeowners' rates are still elevated, Ingoglia insisted relief is coming as reinsurance costs fall and more companies return.""Things are looking up here,"" he said. ""We're just asking for people to continue to be patient on the homeowner's insurance market. It's getting better, but what we can't do is go back to what we used to have, or we would have continued having double-digit rate increases over the past couple of years.""

""People are struggling to stay in their homes just because of their property insurance alone.""New national data backs up some of those concerns. Realtor.com reports condo prices have fallen more than 8% in a year, driven by soaring HOA fees and post-Surfside insurance increases.The site lists five Florida markets in the top ten for highest property insurance burdens, including the number one slot in Southeast Florida.Bankrate ranks Florida as the most expensive auto insurance state in America, averaging more than $4,100 a year.House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell said Democrats will continue pushing proposals that include rate-hike limits, transparency rules and tax incentives for storm-hardening.""We want to make sure that we are approaching the affordability crisis in a way that actually helps families and doesn't further hurt them,"" Driskell said. ""So let's look at regulating the property insurance industry.""She also blasted Republican property-tax amendments, calling them a distraction and warning they could threaten police, parks, and libraries.""[Gov. Ron DeSantis] started all of this, and I don't think that he should have,"" Driskell said of the governor. ""If he really cares about Floridians and cares about the affordability crisis, he should address those things like property insurance. He should address those things like housing affordability, and he has failed to do that.""
