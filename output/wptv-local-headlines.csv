"‘NOT ENOUGH’: Palm Beach County teachers demand higher pay as contracts stall","NewsPalm Beach County ‘NOT ENOUGH’: Palm Beach County teachers demand higher pay as contracts stall Crowds rallied outside the school district headquarters Wednesday Khalil Mclean, WPTV Teachers argued that in an A-rated district, they deserve compensation that reflects their performance. By: Zitlali Solache Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Palm Beach County school district teachers are demanding higher wages after contract negotiations with the school district reached an impasse earlier this month.Crowds rallied outside the school district headquarters Wednesday, then packed the school board meeting to voice their concerns on the raises. ‘NOT ENOUGH’: Palm Beach County teachers demand higher pay as contracts stall “My plea is that you reconsider your priorities and demonstrate through your actions and not just your words that you value the people doing the work that keeps this district running,” said, Michelle Buckel, a teacher at Jupiter Elementary.Several teachers shared one message: a 5% salary increase. Earlier this month, the school district proposed a 1.8% raise along with a 1.5% bonus, but members with the teachers union say that still falls short.“The most important factor in a classroom in schools, for getting students to reach their potential, is a highly effective teacher,” said Gordan Longhofer, president of Palm Beach County Classroom Teachers Association (CTA).Teachers at the rally said inflation and rising costs are making it harder to stay afloat.“It means to be able to live and pay your bills without having to choose between your prescription meds or your light bill,” said Jacqueline Major, a high school English teacher at Rise Academy. “Your cable bill, or your car insurance. It means that we’re worth it.”According to the National Education Association, Florida is 50th in a ranking of average teacher pay across the country.“Even with the referendum, our wages are not enough for a single person to live in this county,” said Jodi Mochel. “Most of my colleagues aren’t here today because they’re at their second or third job.”Crowds argued that in an A-rated district, they deserve compensation that reflects their performance and warned that stagnant pay could drive teachers away.“This is our future. The kids are our future,” said Cheryl Whitehurst, a physical education teacher. “We are A-rated teachers in an A-rated district. We need to be treated that way.”The school district issued the following statement due to the impasse: “The School District of Palm Beach County supports increased compensation for teachers, and we recognize that the success of our students is a direct result of our dedicated educators. The School District has worked diligently to construct a compensation package that exceeds the state’s allocation. The District’s current salary proposal offers five times the amount specifically funded by the state for teacher raises. We achieved this despite significant financial headwinds.The District is currently managing a $40 million budget shortfall. This gap is the result of a decline in enrollment of approximately 6,000 students. We must balance our budget responsibly, and we’re working to avoid layoffs and cuts to student programs. We remain committed to providing the highest possible raises within these financial constraints.The District has a strong history of providing higher raises when state funding allows, including a 10% package just a couple of years ago when the budget was more favorable. Our teacher salaries and benefits remain among the most competitive in the state, and we agree that more must be done by the state to increase teacher pay.Our goal is to reach a fiscally responsible agreement as soon as possible so our teachers receive their pay increases without further delay. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of our teachers and every member of Team Palm Beach.” Chief of Communications Sean Cooley A hearing with a special magistrate has not yet been scheduled. While there is no firm deadline, the review process could take months.","https://www.wptv.com/news/palm-beach-county/not-enough-palm-beach-county-teachers-demand-higher-pay-as-contracts-stall"
"Boca Raton spa struggles to rebuild after October flood","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoca Raton Boca Raton spa struggles to rebuild after October flood WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted and last updated Weeks after flash floods left parts of Boca Raton under water, some small businesses are still struggling to recover, including Boca Skin Spa, where the owner says the October storm caused extensive damage and forced her to shut down for renovations.Carla Columbia, owner of Boca Skin Spa, remembers the moment she realized her business had been hit. Boca Raton spa seeks community help after flooding “The water came in and rushed into the building,” she said.Inside the spa, she says nearly every room was damaged.“That whole wall had to be taken out completely. Every place in this entire spa got hit.""Columbia says she closed up the night of October 26, 2025, with no reason to believe the storm would become destructive.“I went home I didn’t have anything to worry about. The storm was really-really bad. We started getting alerts around 11:30 pm saying flash floods- flash floods, don’t leave your house.""What she returned to the next day, she says, was far worse than she imagined. Water had pushed into multiple rooms, destroying equipment and leaving the spa unusable.“We just thought it's water we have to clean it up and disinfect it and move on. Then we realized this was really devastating”The spa has now been closed since the flood as renovations continue. Columbia says her insurance doesn’t cover most of the damage, leading her to create a GoFundMe to help replace equipment and cover mounting costs.Representatives for the Glades First Center — where Boca Skin Spa is located — say the flood brought 12 to 18 inches of water into parts of the property, affecting several tenants. They say construction crews have been working consistently to replace sheetrock and prevent mold and mildew from spreading inside the damaged units.In a statement to WPTV, the company said Servpro of Fort Lauderdale was hired since October 27, a day after the flood.Company representatives say Servpro has brought 35-50 people per day to these centers and are working between 7AM and 9PM, 7 days a week. In order to minimize any health hazards such as mold and mildew, FEMA requires a minimum of 2 feet of sheet rock to be replaced and all floors to be replaced.""In response to the October flooding, Boca City officials said the city drainage systems were overwhelmed by the amount of rain the city received, with Boca Raton seeing over nine inches of rain without two hours.Zachary Bihr, the Public Works and Engineering director of Boca Raton said they were assessing the city’s critical infrastructure.As of this report, Columbia’s GoFundMe campaign has raised $2,050 of her $10,000 goal.While construction continues, Columbia says the uncertainty remains overwhelming.“I don’t know, I really don’t know.”","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boca-raton/boca-spa-struggles-to-rebuild-after-october-flood"
"'Everything's tripled': Lawmakers push insurance reform to help homeowners","MoneyReal Estate News Legislation reform pushes back on insurance 'exploiting' policy holders WPTV's Joel Lopez is sorting through new findings on the insurance market here in Florida that is revealing that homeowners in the Sunshine State are paying some of the highest insurance premiums WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — We're sorting through new findings on the insurance market here in Florida that is revealing that homeowners in the Sunshine State are paying some of the highest insurance premiums in the nation.WATCH BELOW: 'Everything's tripled,' Jeff Heun tells WPTV's Joel Lopez Legislation reform pushes back on insurance 'exploiting' policy holders A report by Bankrate.com found in Florida, homeowners are paying an average of $5,838 per year on insurance premiums. That's roughly $3,000 more than the national average, putting Florida as the number 3 most expensive states for homeowner insurance.WPTV has heard from many homeowners who said those numbers are more than statistics — they’re a crisis.""I would say for retirees on a fixed income, it's probably forcing people to move out of the state, it's getting pretty expensive here,"" said West Palm Beach homeowner Jeff Heun.Heun told WPTV's Joel Lopez he used to pay $3,400 on his homeowner's insurance when he lived at Prospect Park.""Is that expense something that got more and more expensive over the years?"" Lopez asked, when he followed up.""Oh yeah, everything's tripled. I was gonna file a claim but I would have had my premiums doubled,"" said Huen, who said he never used his homeowner's insurance, and that his new house has much more affordable rates.""What's your message to state leaders?"" asked Lopez. ""Do something,"" said Huen.Another West Palm Beach resident said the combination of the cost of living, rising homeowners insurance rates and mandatory wind coverage is squeezing his household budget. He told WPTV he'd rather spend the money on replacing windows and doors, but because of his mortgage he's required to keep the coverage.WATCH: 'It shouldn’t have to come to that,' family says after reaching out to WPTV about insurance claim How WPTV helped this family with insurance claim after tornado devastation Some homeowners are going without insurance by choice. One woman told WPTV she hasn't had homeowners insurance in 25 years and said if there was an emergency, she would use the money she saved on not having the annual coverage on repairs.For many residents, the result is difficult choices: pay rising premiums, drain savings, or go without coverage and risk devastating expense after a disaster. Some who relied on insurance after disasters — and struggled to get adequate payouts.In Loxahatchee, Bob and Pam Fix turned to their insurer after a tornado caused more than $40,000 in damage. Their company initially offered $4,500 for repairs that was later increased to $7,000.WPTV's Kate Hussey investigated, and the Fixes were ultimately approved for $41,000, the amount they need to begin repairs.It's been an issue WPTV has been working to find solutions on as they said the affordability crisis is reaching it's breaking point.""Unless this is reversed in Florida and beyond, I see a bigger problem ahead,"" said Dr. Martin Weiss. He's the founder of Weiss Ratings, which independently grades stocks, mutual funds, and financial institutions.""We are here to empower consumers. Our job here is to provide the data and make the public aware,"" said Weiss.He's part of Unlocking America’s Future and Insurance Fairness Project' along with Florida State Senator Carlos Guillermo Smith who is pushing for more transparency between insurance companies and the profits with affiliated managing general agents, to hold them accountable for ""exploiting"" policy holders in Florida.""Floridians cannot afford to pay the highest property insurance premiums in the nation, which they currently do right now, simply in order to pay inflated managing agent fees that really pad the pockets of affiliates who have dodged accountability for too long,"" said Smith. WPTV Investigates How WPTV helped this family with insurance claim after tornado devastation Kate Hussey The challenge is that Florida has a super Republican majority and this push is by Democratic state leaders. So how do they plan get the proposed reforms passed? Smith said they're using a ""throw everything at the wall to see what will stick"" approach: a wide-ranging agenda meant to force action and generate discussions about what can pass in Tallahassee.""Some of the proposals that some of my senate democratic colleagues here in the Florida senate have put forward as part of that full package are already being given consideration and are being put on the agenda,"" said Smith.That includes legislation related to capping rate increases on more than 10-15% as well as measures to remove taxes on impact-resistant doors, windows and garage doors.Proponents believe the tax free benefit will encourage homeowners to storm-proof their properties — steps that could lead to lower premiums over time.The stakes are high.Recent figures show Florida is among the worst states for denied claims, with just over 40% of claims closed with no payments.Florida also leads the nation in dropped renewals, at 3.3%.A later debate in Tallahassee will determine whether those pressures translate into policy that eases the burden on Florida homeowners.

It wasn't perfect, but it was a roof over her head and a place she believed she could manage on her fixed income.On Wednesday, she was packing again.""As of tomorrow, I need to be gone from this,"" said Horoff.Walking us through the room she's been living in, Horoff said her time is up. She shows a letter requesting nearly $1,000 to stay, followed by another notice demanding she leave.WATCH BELOW: 'The money I have doesn't meet the money they need,' Sue Horoff tells WPTV Resident fears homelessness as Inn at Boynton prepares for sale For Horoff, it's a familiar crisis: Everything comes down to money.Together, she and her partner bring in just under $2,000 a month from Social Security. She said that covers about three weeks at the extended stay — plus her cell phone bill. But the fourth week — the one she can't afford — is now costing her the room.""So it got a little better,"" she said, ""but then I was out of money.""Horoff's situation echoes what seniors across Palm Beach County are experiencing.A recent America's Health Rankings Senior Report shows:12% of seniors live below the poverty line35% struggle with housing-related financial concernsAnd with the expiration of emergency COVID-era rental and housing assistance, our reporting has found that local agencies have fewer resources to help people like Horoff.She said she's made call after call trying to find aid.""They said, 'Sorry, we're out of funds, but you can call this number,'"" Horoff recalled.But she has no car, making even temporary solutions difficult to reach.Earlier this year, residents at The Inn at Boynton were told they needed to leave as the property's sale to the Boynton Beach CRA moved forward — part of a negotiation that had been underway since May.

"'Seconds to decide': Retired police chief on shooting of machete-wielding man","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach County 'Seconds to decide': Retired police chief on shooting of machete-wielding man near Riviera Beach Richard Morris, a retired deputy police chief, said the deputies' response was justified given the circumstances PBSO By: Kayla McDermott Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A 19-year-old man was shot by Palm Beach County deputies after they say he charged at them with a machete during a domestic disturbance call in the Palm Lakes Estates community near Riviera Beach. Investigators say Andre Mayard walked outside a home and retrieved what deputies described as a ""strategically placed"" foot-and-a-half-long machete from hedges before raising it above his head and approaching officers aggressively, according to Chief Deputy Robert Allen with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. 19-year-old man wielding machete shot by Palm Beach County deputies ""He immediately raised it above his head and began approaching the deputies in a fairly aggressive manner,"" Allen said.Deputies repeatedly told Mayard to put down the weapon, but he refused to comply, Allen explained. ""Until they finally had no other recourse but to stop his aggressive actions by firing on him,"" Allen said.Mayard was taken to a hospital following the shooting. His current condition is critical. Richard Morris, a retired deputy police chief, said the deputies' response was justified given the circumstances. ""The police officer has seconds to react — do I live or do I die,"" Morris said. Morris noted that officers say they attempted to retreat before using deadly force. ""A machete is a very violent weapon and the fact that it was planted ahead of time makes it more calculated and scary,"" Morris said.Morris explained why deputies couldn't use less lethal options in this situation. Palm Beach County Former detective on 4 recent shootings: 'I don't believe they had a choice' Kayla McDermott ""Police officers have seconds to decide life or death. You know, everybody always goes, you know, why didn't they use a taser? You can't use a taser because, again, if the taser fails, you never meet non-lethal force with lethal force,"" Morris said. This marks the sixth officer-involved shooting WPTV's Kayla McDermott has reported on in our viewing area this year. In every case, law enforcement said they were attacked or charged at by a suspect. According to the Police Brutality Center, Florida ranked third in the country for states with the most officer-involved shootings in 2024. The state recorded 82 deaths, with the majority of shootings occurring in South Florida and primarily related to domestic disturbances. Morris said these statistics align with national trends and suggested deeper investigation into the root causes of these incidents. West Palm Beach Police: Origin of bullet that hit West Palm Beach officer under investigation Samantha Roesler ""I think we're at a point now with these police shootings that the coroner's office is going to have to start doing autopsies and see what the drug content was, what you know, what? What was the true cause? A lot of them are going to be drug-induced. A lot of them, the ones that aren't drug-induced, we're going to find out that the person's probably had a long history going all the way back to his school days of mental health issues. That's where the system is failing is, they don't turn around and address the problem,"" Morris said.""Florida officers, I'm actually shocked the rates aren't higher because of the amount of contact officers have with people with mental illness,"" Morris said.The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office believes only one deputy fired during the incident, but further investigation is needed to confirm this detail.

Pastor Chris Edmonds travels around the country and recently made a stop in Palm Beach County, speaking to students at different schools. Pastor Edmonds says during World War II, his father, Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds, defied orders from a Nazi to reveal which U.S. soldiers were Jewish in 1945. They were part of the 106th Infantry Division. Pastor Edmonds, who started the Roddie's Code organization, said, ""That's how he lived his life. His favorite scripture was John 15:13, 'Greater love has no one than this, to lay down one's life for his friend.' He not only loved that verse, he lived that verse best he could, and definitely lived it in that camp, in the POW camp, 'cause that's what saved their lives.”The organization Insight Through Education hosted Edmonds coming to town to speak with students.
