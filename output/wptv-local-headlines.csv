"Fort Pierce city manager wins over city leaders 6 months into the job","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyFort Pierce Fort Pierce city manager wins over city leaders 6 months into the job After stepping into the role following a turbulent leadership change, City Manager Richard Chess receives strong reviews and a raise as commissioners set their expectations for the future. Six months after taking the helm as Fort Pierce’s city manager, Richard Chess is earning high marks from city commissioners, who say he’s bringing stability and fresh direction to city operations. By: Cassandra Garcia Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Six months after taking the helm as Fort Pierce’s city manager, Richard Chess is earning high marks from city commissioners, who say he’s bringing stability and fresh direction to city operations.“Your six months has been, you got thrown right into the deep-end and so far I'm very pleased,” Mayor Linda Hudson said during a performance review at the city commission meeting Monday. Fort Pierce city manager wins over city leaders six months into the job Commissioners offered similar praise, describing Chess as a capable and strategic leader.“You truly are a chief executive officer and I say that as a true compliment,” said Commissioner Michael Broderick. “You are skilled at it and I am confident that we are going to deal with one issue at a time.”Chess, who previously served as Broward County’s assistant general manager of transportation, stepped into the role after former City Manager Nick Mimms was fired following his arrest last year on charges of bid rigging and official misconduct. The scandal left the city searching for steady leadership to guide its recovery.During the selection process, Chess and City Clerk Linda Cox were the final two candidates for the role. When Chess was appointed, Broderick and Hudson were among those who opposed the decision, but both now say their perspectives have changed.“I was very impressed with what you have, the knowledge you gained, and I think that you're a staff champion, and I appreciate that, except that you're not a pushover,” Hudson said.Broderick also acknowledged his shift in perspective. “I was wrong and I admit it,” he said. “Change is here, it's being implemented, and you have the respect of the city commission to get this done.”Commissioner Arnold Gaines commended Chess for his proactive approach. “I like how you have systematically started to not only attack and try to fix the problems but you are not afraid to call out the problems and bring it to our attention,” Gaines said.After the review, Chess was granted a 5% raise in accordance with the terms of his contract. Commissioners also laid out clear expectations for his future leadership.“I think that the King’s Landing development which has now been approved and back on, that we need to really work closely with them and make sure that that is a success because that's something that has been a long time coming,” Hudson said.Gaines added a challenge for the city manager as he continues to settle in. “You had the first two months and you finally took off a glove. I'm asking you to take off both gloves and roll your sleeves up, and get down to doing what we hired you to do to address the issues that you know are there.”As Chess looks ahead, city leaders say the city manager is poised to steer Fort Pierce toward progress.

"Wellington mother turns grief into healing with ‘Wind Phone’ at local preserve","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWellington Wellington mother turns grief into healing with ‘Wind Phone’ at local preserve After losing her husband and son to cancer, Debbie Cyran helps create a space for comfort and connection in nature WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated WELLINGTON, Fla. — Deep inside the Wellington Environmental Preserve, a quiet new addition is helping people connect with loved ones they’ve lost — one call at a time. It’s called a “Wind Phone.” While it doesn’t actually have reception, the meaning behind it is powerful.“It’s just a little box,” said Debbie Cyran. “You slide it out, pick it up, and you make a phone call — and the wind just carries your words to your loved ones in spirit.” Wellington mother turns grief into healing with “Wind Phone” at local preserve Debbie knows loss all too well. She lost both her husband, Stanley Cyran in 2018, and her son, Steve Carnahan, to cancer just last year.In the depths of grief, she connected with a support group called Helping Parents Heal, and that’s where she first learned about the concept of a Wind Phone.“We took a little trip down to Hillsborough Beach, where there is a wind phone, and it's in a beautiful place,” said Cyran. “It's behind the police station, but it's like right on the edge of the waterway, the intercostal waterway, and it's just absolutely beautiful, and it's very calming. It's comforting. And so I was talking to my friend, and I said, you know, I'd like to do one of those. I think I'd like to put one in my in my garden. Then I decided, you know, the only people that would be able to use it are the people in my family and my friends. So let's put it somewhere where everybody can use it.”When she brought the idea to the Village of Wellington, officials suggested placing it in the very park where Debbie’s family spent so much time together. For her, it felt meant to be.“I feel them here,” she said. “That’s one of the reasons I come so often. I feel them around me a lot.”Debbie visits the preserve nearly every week. She often dials her old home phone number before speaking softly into the receiver.“Hey honey,” she said during her visit with WPTV’s Michael Hoffman. “We’re really doing this.” WPTV At the base of the Wind Phone, visitors have left painted memorial rocks and a notebook filled with handwritten messages — tokens of love, loss, and healing from people who’ve made their own calls to the wind.“It is beautiful,” Debbie said. “I’m so grateful we put this here, and that so many people can be comforted and healed. It’s part of the healing process.”The Wind Phone now stands as a quiet reminder that love doesn’t fade, and that even in grief, connection is still possible.

"This garden is facing financial challenges while nurturing mental health","NewsPalm Beach County Mental Health America of the Palm Beaches' garden in need of repairs WPTV's Joel Lopez is speaking to those who have benefited from a garden that has now fallen into disrepair WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — At a nonprofit in Palm Beach County, a community garden is more than just a patch of greenery, it's a lifeline for mental health therapy.Mental Health America of the Palm Beaches, located off Fern Street on the edge of downtown West Palm Beach.WATCH BELOW: 'Here you have a chance to really grow and thrive. It's just a family,' Rick Malave tells WPTV This garden is facing financial challenges while nurturing mental health It's a national organization but the local chapter has been in West Palm Beach for 76th years, and has its roots in advocacy for individuals facing mental health challenges.But after years of dedication, a garden which as been a testament to their commitment and therapy, is falling into disrepair.“It’s helped me, because at first I was nervous and everything; after being here a few months I’m like, ‘Okay, I like this,’” shared 21-year-old member Laronte Hunter.For him, tending to the garden has opened doors to connection and camaraderie. “What I love about it mostly is that everybody comes together as one; it's about a whole community,” he said.He’s passionate about the project and motivated to get others involved.“I want to make sure that everybody else be like wanting to work on this garden with me,"" he said. ""Let’s do it, let's get to work!”The garden is alive with colorful flowers, fresh vegetables, and caterpillars preparing to turn into butterflies. Peer specialist Rick Malave sees the butterflies as a metaphor for the clients he says transform by the garden.“The garden is serenity, a place to come decompress, a safe space,"" he explained.Once struggling with addiction, Malave now pays it forward, helping others find healing. “Here you have a chance to really grow and thrive. It's just a family,” he said.One of the clubhouse coordinators, Liz Brumley echoed his sentiments. WPTV CEO Andrew McAusland shares with WPTV's Joel Lopez the positive impact the garden is having on the members. “This garden is hugely enriching,"" said Brumley. ""Just having this space that they’ve created alongside me, we’ve planted everything here.”However, the garden faces significant challenges. Rotting wooden planters and hungry iguanas threaten the hard work put into nurturing this sanctuary.“We grow things like basil and turn it into pesto and we love it, but the iguanas, they also like the basil,” Brumley lamented.To tackle these issues, the nonprofit has set a $5,000 fundraising goal to create an enclosure to protect their plants and replace aging pots and planters.“We’ve come a long way from the start with the garden. The better it is, the better it is for the mental well-being for our staff and members,” said Andrew McAusland, CEO of the nonprofit.McAusland notes that the garden serves as a critical resource for members, stating that the environment positively impacts their energy and outlook on well-being.Over the past two years, daily visits have increased from just three members to upwards of 20, thanks in part to raising awareness about mental health resources, and to the growth in population he's seen in West Palm Beach.“People who suffer from a mental health challenge are people just like you and me. We’re not clinical, we’re concerned with how you can contribute and be a part of the community,” McAusland stressed.He encourages anyone with a loved one facing mental health challenges to visit the center. “We are a refuge for anybody who may otherwise be isolated. What’s important is to be connected to a community, and that’s what we’re about,” he said.As the garden continues to grow and evolve, the hope remains that support will flourish alongside it,If you'd like to help the garden begin new roots, you can email them at info@mhapalmbeaches.org or call (561) 832-3755.

We were pretty much in survival mode,” said Palm Beach business owner Richard Godden, who distributes popular Jamaican produce to South Florida.Godden said the industry had only recently recovered from last year’s losses.“Fast forward to 2025, the crop rebounded. Right now, they are flourishing but here comes Melissa that’s threatening, that’s probably about to repeat history as far as devastating the industry again,” he said.Godden’s business depends on importing Jamaican staples like callaloo, scotch bonnet peppers, pepper sauce, and jerk seasoning. He fears Melissa could deal a heavy blow to farmers and exporters across the island.“We’re on pins and needles, quite honestly, and just praying for a change in path,” he said.Melissa is expected to dump heavy rain causing life-threatening flash floods and landslides. The concerns go beyond business. Many in the Jamaican diaspora are also bracing for the storm’s potential impact on family and friends back home.“It’s the island-wide impact that this will have on everyone, so that no one will be able to fare better if the hurricane hits in a worst-case scenario,” Godden added.At Jerk Island Jamaican Restaurant in Palm Beach County, longtime business owner Junior Dixon shares the similar concern. WPTV/Trey Herbert Haitian radio personality LeGrand Perisien Salvant. “You’ll have a lot of mudslides, a lot of roads are being eroded,” Dixon said.Melissa has already dumped heavy rainfall across Haiti and the Dominican Republic.“We already have three dead; two in Port-au-Prince due to landslides,” said Haitian radio personality, LeGrand Parisien Salvant.The National Hurricane Center said Melissa could strengthen into a hurricane in the coming days.“It’s going to be devastating,” Godden said. “We’ll repeat what happened in 2024, where we’re just gonna have to pick up the pieces from here.”Residents within the Caribbean diaspora said they’re hoping Melissa changes path or weakens in the coming days.

WATCH BELOW: 'In that moment, it looked like a real video,' Melanie Valentine tells WPTV Experts warn of AI video use after man tries to lure woman into car Melanie Valentine told WPTV she was making keys at the Home Depot on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach around 10 p.m. on Oct. 17, when a man in his 20s approached her with what appeared to be video evidence of someone stealing her husband's truck from the parking lot. ""He said, you have to follow me. You have to follow me. We can catch him. We can catch him,"" Valentine said.The video looked incredibly realistic, but Valentine said she trusted her instincts and refused to follow the stranger outside. Instead, she called police, while her neighbor went to check on the vehicle.""In that moment, it looked like a real video. I thought it was a real video,"" Valentine said. ""But I had that just a gut feeling that something was off, and, of course, I wasn't going to follow the guy out front.""Her neighbor discovered the truck was exactly where they had left it. He also spotted another person crouched behind the vehicle, prompting him to alert Home Depot security.""Yeah, it was wild. It was pretty shocking,"" said Valentine. West Palm Beach police confirmed Valentine filed a report and are investigating the incident as suspicious activity.Valentine said the responding officer told her she hadn't encountered this type of scheme before, but believed it represented a new use of AI technology for carjacking attempts.""Thankfully, I had the wherewithal. I didn't follow them outside, you know, because who knows what would have happened?"" said Valentine.

By: Kayla McDermott , Aja Dorsainvil Posted and last updated PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Port St. Lucie police said a 19-year-old man was arrested after he picked up a landscaping rock and threw it at the rear window of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicle, shattering it.WATCH BELOW: 'It just doesn't make sense,' Rob Diaz tells WPTV's Kayla McDermott 19-year-old arrested after rock thrown at ICE vehicle window The incident occurred on Tuesday at about 10:30 a.m. at the Wawa located at 10308 SW Village Pkwy.Preliminary investigation revealed that one of the federal agents was driving through the parking lot of the Wawa after they had arrested the father of 19-year-old Pasqual Velasquez Martin, when the teen picked up a landscaping rock from the north side of the parking lot and threw it at the occupied ICE vehicle.Velasquez Martin, of Stuart, then left the parking lot, but was quickly located by federal agents between the nearby MD Now and PDQ restaurant, police said.According to police, a witness to the crime confirmed that Velasquez Martin threw the rock, shattering the vehicle’s window. No federal agents were injured in the attack.Body camera footage captured an officer saying ""I got him"" during the arrest.The teen was taken into custody and transported to the St. Lucie County Jail, where he is being held on $25,000 bond.Velasquez Martin faces one count of throwing a deadly Missile into an occupied vehicle, which is a second-degree felony.""It's business as usual. We're going to enforce the laws,"" said Chief Leo Niemczyk of the Port St. Lucie Police Department.The incident comes as residents report observing increased immigration patrols on the Treasure Coast, even amid ICE protests. A separate incident on Wednesday in Martin County resulted in the arrest of a 23-year-old man for allegedly shoving an officer during a protest.Community members shopping at the Wawa had mixed reactions to Velasquez Martin's alleged actions.""You should never assault a police officer,"" said John, a local resident. ""I think they should be arrested and thrown in jail.""However, Stephanie Williams expressed understanding for Velasquez Martin's reaction. ""I can't blame him. I'd be upset too,"" Williams said.""He didn't hurt nobody. That's still a man with a gun.""WATCH: Bodycam video of arrest by Port St. Lucie police Bodycam arrest of 19-year-old after rock thrown at ICE vehicle Rob Diaz questioned the situation entirely.""It just doesn't make sense,"" he said.The arrest occurred as Port St. Lucie recently approved putting officers through the 287(g) program, which would have them trained by ICE agents. Niemczyk addressed concerns about officer safety given recent violence against immigration patrols. ""I have full control over where my officers participate, and I'm not expecting any large change in our operation over that agreement,"" Niemczyk said.Williams expressed opposition to the agreement and immigration operations in her community. ""I think they need to go home and find something else to do,"" Williams said. Other residents welcomed the patrols. ""I'm pro-police,"" John said. ""If you're here illegally, you should be gone.""Police said it doesn't appear Velasquez Martin is undocumented.

Mitchell Elementary School.Neighbors who live nearby the school said they’re already noticing safer driving. More than 200 drivers ticketed in first week of Boca school zone speed cameras “I think people are starting to become more aware,” said resident Jonathan Shair.We first told you about the speed zone cameras back in July. Last week, parents weighed in on the cameras, and they’re already seeing safer driving.Drivers going 10 miles over the speed limit in active school zones will be cited $100. For Shair, that lesson hit when he got a warning in the mail.“Because of this [warning], I will make sure that I try to be more careful when I’m on that road for sure,” said Shair.Thousands of drivers like Shair were given these warnings during the test period last month. He believes the system is working.“I just hope that they’ll put in more cameras along all these schools so we can really make the city a safe place to live,” said Shair.We learned where the revenue is distributed:$60 stays with the city or county to help run the camera program and fund other public safety initiatives.$20 goes to the General Revenue Fund.$12 goes to the local school district for safety improvements, transportation, or security — funds that must also be shared with charter schools.$5 supports the School Crossing Guard Recruitment and Retention Program.$3 goes to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for training.

"This new addition will soon bring restaurants and family fun to Port St. Lucie","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyPort St Lucie New addition to The Port District will soon bring restaurants and family fun to Port St. Lucie The Grove is a $15 million public-private partnership promises hundreds of jobs and new entertainment options, but some residents worry about parking and traffic WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Port St. Lucie residents have long asked for more entertainment options close to home. Now, city leaders say their answering the call with a new public-private partnership that will bring dining, nightlife and family-friendly spaces to the heart of the city.WATCH BELOW: 'Can’t wait to see it come to fruition,' Lillian Soto tells WPTV This new addition will soon bring restaurants and family fun to Port St. Lucie By early next year, the vacant lot next to Pioneer Park in The Port District is expected to be transformed into The Grove, an entertainment hub that will feature seven venues offering everything from rooftop dining to casual eateries.“We’re excited about it! Can’t wait to see it come to fruition,” said resident Lillian Soto.The project marks the latest milestone in Port St. Lucie’s ongoing surge of growth and development. Community leaders broke ground on The Grove less than two weeks after announcing plans for a soccer stadium nearby.“I have seen Port St. Lucie change quite a bit. It is becoming more geared towards families which is nicer because there really wasn’t a lot for young families to do in the area,” said resident Shantel Luke.Developed by SŪDĀ Investments, the $15 million project is expected to create more than 200 jobs and attract an estimated 400,000 visitors annually.“Bringing that economic impact—bringing those dollars right here into Port St. Lucie is really great for our local economy,” said Mayor Shannon Martin.WATCH BELOW: Port St. Lucie awarded professional soccer team Port St. Lucie awarded professional soccer team Many residents said a space like this has been long overdue.“We travel outside of Port St. Lucie to go find fun things to do so this will keep money down here, revenue down here, and keep us down here too,” said resident Jonathan Loyd.“It’s nice, especially living down here directly in this community for my kids to be able to come here and play, for us to do date nights or walk down here, the boys to come fishing,” Luke added.While excitement grows, some residents expressed concern about potential parking and traffic issues once the district opens.“The parking lot right now is already full,” said Gemini Soto. “There’s zero, zero parking at all—where are we going to put those people?”Martin said the city has planned ahead to address those concerns.“Everything has been set and planned according to all of our planning standards, according to all the traffic analyses and it’s not like we’re going to have swarms of hundreds and hundreds or thousands of people at a time,” she said.For now, residents are eagerly awaiting the arrival of what city officials hope will become a destination for locals and visitors alike, offering a vibrant new space for dining, entertainment and community connection.

"This mayor could be the next Palm Beach County Attorney","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWellington Wellington Mayor Michael Napoleone on short list to become next Palm Beach County Attorney WPTV reaches out to the village to ask if Napoleone would have to step down as mayor Village of Wellington Wellington Mayor Michael J. Napoleone By: Michael Hoffman , Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WELLINGTON, Fla. — WPTV learned Thursday night that Wellington Village Mayor Michael Napoleone is on the short list to become the next Palm Beach County Attorney.His consideration to leaving the position, after voters gave him more than 80% of the vote last March, hasn’t been previously reported until Thursday. We started pushing for answers after we learned Napoleone applied to become a county attorney and is being interviewed for the job. Wellington Mayor Michael Napoleone on short list for Palm Beach County Attorney role Napoleone confirmed to WPTV with a statement saying, ""I'm honored to be on the final interview list. Right now, I'm letting the process play out. I'm focusing on the jobs I have now and will make a decision as to everything else after the Commission makes their decision.""In the state of Florida, it is illegal for an individual to hold two government offices at the same time.WPTV reporter Michael Hoffman reached out to the Village of Wellington to ask if Napoleone would have to step down as mayor if he takes on the new job with the county.In a statement provided to Hoffman, the Village attorney said in part:""There is nothing in Wellington’s Charter or Code of Ordinances that would require the Mayor to resign from his position if he is selected to be the County Attorney. In addition, in AGO 73-337, the Florida Attorney General opined that an elected school board member’s employment as a part-time County Attorney would not constitute dual office holding under Florida’s Constitution…” “ We do not know whether any County policy would require him to resign. Whether he continued in office or not would likely be part of his negotiations with the County. If he did remain as Mayor while also serving as the County Attorney, he would have to be careful to avoid any matters involving the County and Wellington.""Searching for answers, Hoffman spoke with attorney and former Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg. He said that while he would likely be allowed to hold both positions, there would have to be precautions taken.""There's not an automatic conflict of interest here,"" Aronberg said. ""Obviously, if something comes before the County Commission and the attorney's desk that has something to do with the Village of Wellington, or anything to do with himself, personally, he would have to recuse himself, but a blanket conflict, no.""The village also told Hoffman that if Napoleone does step down, it would likely require the municipality to have a special election to fill the mayor's seat since two council seats are up for election as well.No decision has been made by the county commission at this time.Napoleone was elected to the mayor's seat in 2024, serving a term intended to go through 2028. The Boca Raton native joined the Village Council in 2015, serving as the first non-sitting council member elected without opposition in the Village's history. He also served as vice mayor from April 2019 to April 2020 and was re-appointed to the position in April 2023.The current county attorney, Denise Coffman, is retiring in December, according to multiple sources. In her resignation letter she cited ""next steps, pathways forward and my family's needs.""
