Nachlas has previously shared her concerns about some riders not knowing the rules of the road.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Boca Raton hosts micro-mobility town hall to address e-bike and scooter safety concerns “It’s getting that unified message out, getting the information out and everybody being on the same page so that all of those places are safer for everyone to be,” said Nachlas.We’ve been closely following e-bike safety in Palm Beach County following numerous deadly crashes this past year. Nachlas hopes the initiative will be the first step in preventing tragedy.“Sometimes you’ll see kids sing in and out of traffic and that’s where I get worried,” said Nachlas. “It’s not just pedestrians and bikes anymore, it’s a bunch of different, bunch of different micro-mobility devices. Even within the e-bike category, there are several types of e-bikes.”Nachlas hopes the panel of experts, helmet giveaways, and conversations on rules of the road will spark change.Those attending the town hall are set to learn about the new traffic safety enhancement at the intersection of NE 2nd Street & Mizner Blvd.“We really are interested in the city being a safe space for all,” said Nachlas.A city spokesperson adds that council members have worked with city advisory boards on collecting information from the community and will look into enforcing regulations in the future.“The City Council has taken a proactive approach by specifically tasking the Citizens' Pedestrian & Bikeway Advisory Board (CPBAB) approximately six months ago to research and advise on best practices for e-bike and micro-mobility regulation and safety. City Council will be reviewing the outcome of the plan's recommendations and developing policy decisions based on this data in the upcoming year.”The city adds the event is at full capacity and they expect 100 residents.

"Former Stuart City Manager breaks silence, calls termination 'unfortunate'","NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin CountyStuart Former Stuart City Manager breaks silence, calls termination 'unfortunate' and 'retaliatory' Michael Mortell challenges the circumstances surrounding his termination, calling one commissioner's comments misleading and retaliatory WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted STUART, Fla. — Former Stuart City Manager Michael Mortell is breaking his silence after city commissioners voted Monday to terminate his contract.The commission voted 3-2 to fire Mortell without cause, following weeks of tension that began when Commissioner Sean Reed called for his resignation earlier this month.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Former Stuart City Manager breaks silence, calls termination 'unfortunate' and 'retaliatory' “There were things that caused me concern throughout my due diligence or things that were brought forward to my attention,” Reed said during Monday’s meeting.When asked to elaborate on those concerns, Reed declined to speak on camera.Mortell said he felt “ambushed” by Commissioner Reed's comments during the meeting.“I was astounded that in a modern society that this could actually happen and that he actually thought that there was some level of that that was appropriate,” Mortell said.Mortell said the allegations against him were misrepresented and motivated by retaliation.“It is the most unprofessional thing that’s happened to me in my entire life and it is him retaliating against me because I told him that he has to follow the law and he thinks that he’s smarter and bigger than everybody else,” Mortell said.Mortell, who has spent more than two decades with the city, said he plans to pursue legal action.“The damage he has done could cause me to be unemployed. I’ll have to find out, but I know what’s for sure,” he said. “I’m going to take whatever action is necessary to make this stop.”Despite the abrupt end to his tenure, Mortell said he remains confident in the city’s staff and their ability to continue serving residents.“The staff at the city is so professional and they've been there and they care so much about the city—they care as much as I do and they will work as hard as they can to make sure the city stays the way it is,” Mortell said.

We just continued to pray; we're a very prayerful family,"" she recalled.On Tuesday she told WPTV she lost contact with her family in Jamaica, who were facing the wrath of the storm as it made landfall, and she couldn't get ahold of them.""It was very stressful; we just had to continue to pray,"" Hawthorne said, during those anxious hours,It wasn't until Wednesday morning that she received the long-awaited message from her family.""It was such a relief. Oh glory to God, everything was good. No destruction, just no light right now,"" she said.Her family, residing in Kingston on the eastern side of the island, experienced mostly rain and wind damage. The impact of the storm was daunting. ""Yesterday things got pretty rough with rain and wind in Kingston city,"" described Hawthorne's cousin, Simone Clarke-Cooper. ""I could hear the wind as if it were in the room with me. I could only imagine if this is what we are experiencing in an area that is not as hard hit as they are, I cannot imagine what 185 mph winds would look like.""WATCH BELOW: Jamaica reeling from Hurricane Melissa Melissa’s deadly path: Jamaica reeling as storm hits Cuba, heads for Bahamas Clarke-Cooper expressed the surreal feeling of witnessing the devastation in the hardest-hit areas.""There are entire parishes, towns that have been flattened. There are buildings that are unrecognizable,"" she said. ""There are roads that have become rivers; there are roads that are impassable, because there are downed trees.""She said the toll on the people has been heart-wrenching. ""There are people who have lost everything—everything,"" she said. ""There are people here who have nothing but the shirts on their backs, so it's going to be really hard on them to rebuild, because there is catastrophic damage.""In the spirit of solidarity, Hawthorne's cousin's restaurant, Golden Krust, has become a drop-off location for supplies collected by the nonprofit Free Spirit Outreach, which aims to assist families impacted by Hurricane Melissa.Any business or location that would like to help with the initiative can contact Free Spirit Outreach and they'll place large blue barrels to fill with donations.While WPTV was at Golden Krust, the nonprofits came by for its first round of pickups.They say the response from the community has been nothing short of incredible. ""I know what it feels like after a storm not to have anything, but getting help is one of the things that brings comfort, and that’s what we want to do,"" said Lincoln Lewis, president of Free Spirit Outreach and fellow Jamaican.Lewis emphasized a crucial need for financial support to cover shipping costs for a container filled with supplies they hope to send to Jamaica by the end of the week. ""We already have people on the ground, but as soon as these items arrive, they are ready to start distributing,"" he added.The extent of the damage on the island is still being assessed, as Hurricane Melissa continues to move through the Caribbean.""It is devastating to see, it is sad to see but even more importantly, Joel, it's the spirit of Jamaica that I've seen this morning,"" said Clarke-Cooper, ""with everybody saying we are ready to rebuild, because we have proven before that we are a resilient nation and we will be again.""

For the second year in a row, Security First Insurance, based in Ormond Beach, is looking to lower its rates.WATCH BELOW: Florida-based Security First Insurance announces lower rates Florida-based Security First Insurance announces lower rates ""Security First just filed for an additional 8% decrease on our biggest homeowner's product,"" said Melissa Burt DeVriese, the company's president. ""While many Floridians continue to face rising insurance costs, Security First is moving in the opposite direction.""The rollback follows a 5.2% decrease in 2024 for the company.It comes at a time when many policyholders are still struggling with insurance costs across the state.The reduction follows a trend among some insurance companies after state reforms on curbing litigation.""Really, what you're seeing is the result of all the cost-cutting moves insurance companies have made to keep our costs low and all the moves we've done to address fraudulent claims. That's really what's driving these reductions,"" DeVriese said.The company expects 50,000 of its 140,000 policyholders in Florida should feel the impact of the rate reduction. ""We are writing more policies in South Florida,"" DeVriese saidHowever, in South Florida, where risks and costs run higher, the impact may be mixed.""One of the important things to note is that while we're reducing the rates for our policies for a lot of consumers, their actual premium will be going up because the cost of their home and the cost of the replacement of their home has gone up,"" DeVriese said.Security First is not alone in reducing rates — several other insurers have also cut rates, giving policyholders more reason to shop around for the best deal.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

""We don't have the marketing, advertising dollars, and we also need sponsorships.""Gray launched the nonprofit in 2014 to teach young people leadership, critical thinking, and business skills. Inside the Boynton Beach Mall, she now runs the Kidpreneur Leadership Academy, a hands-on learning space for kids ages 9 to 16.""We're helping them with reading, math, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence,"" Gray said. ""They put on costumes, and for the day they are either the fireman, the policeman — they own the grocery store.""Gray said the program regularly saw 15 to 20 kids each week. Now, that number is down to just a few.""Last week we had three kids come through,"" she said. ""Right now we're having to charge, because we're not getting the grants.""In the last few months, Gray said her nonprofit has applied for more than 25 grants, but only received three small approvals.Beyond youth programs, GBDC also serves adults and seniors through its 40-foot technology bus, which travels to communities to help people get connected — from paying bills and filling out applications to learning basic computer skills.But the bus has been out of service for about six months. Gray said she'll need around $10,000 to get it back on the road.To help fill the funding gap, GBDC is hosting its 2nd Annual Young Entrepreneurs Awards and Fundraising Eventon November 8 from 6 to 10 p.m. at the Delray Beach Golf Club.Gray hopes the event — along with more community support — will help keep her programs running.""We do need to raise about $50,000 to help with some of our capacity issues,"" she said. ""So that we can focus on providing these programs, get our 'Call My Ride' vans on the road, get our technology bus back on the road.""Gray says her goal remains the same: to empower local youth and families — and keep the spirit of entrepreneurship alive in Boynton Beach.If you'd like to learn more about the GBDC Entrepreneurship Institute or donate to its programs, click here.

By: Jamie Ostroff Posted and last updated PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — A local woman who has been fighting for unemployment benefits for five months is finally getting help from the state after WPTV brought her story to light last week.When chief investigator Jamie Ostroff first met Lena Hoti on Oct. 14, she was facing a crucial deadline with just two weeks before potentially losing the room she rents in Port St. Lucie.WATCH BELOW: Woman's reemployment struggle prompts state response after WPTV report 'It gives me hope': Port St. Lucie woman doesn't give up despite reemployment struggle ""I need to pay my rent, and if I don't have this money, I'm going to end up on the street,"" Hoti said. ""I have about two weeks before I have to vacate.""Hoti applied for reemployment benefits in June after losing her hotel housekeeping job. By mid-October, her case hadn't even been adjudicated despite her weekly follow-ups with the state.""Nobody can really give me a straight answer, and it's kind of frustrating,"" Hoti said.After Ostroff emailed FloridaCommerce asking about the delay, a spokeswoman responded on Monday, saying in part: ""While we cannot speak to hypothetical outreach that you're receiving, the majority of circumstances when a claim is taking additional time relate to when the claimant and former employer dispute the facts of how the employee was separated from the employer, or when the circumstances of the claim as submitted are not legally eligible for reemployment.""The spokeswoman also said FloridaCommerce is now working directly with Hoti to adjudicate her claim.WPTV visited Hoti again on Tuesday.""Well, I got a phone call (Monday) night saying that I have to file an appeal with one of my employers, that I was employed with this company,"" Hoti said. ""I never got anything or an email or anything. So I don't know what I have to appeal either, but apparently I got to appeal something.""Hoti said the only documents she received from FloridaCommerce came late last week, including a letter dated Oct. 15, showing her claim was submitted in June and scheduling her first payment request for June 30, 2025.""Why they didn't send me this earlier? I have no idea,"" Hoti said. ""I think they just set it up so that people can fail.""Despite the ongoing challenges, Hoti remains determined in her battle for benefits.""I don't fail,"" Hoti said. ""I'm going to keep bugging them until they get me the money."" ACT OF KINDNESS While the communication with FloridaCommerce is encouraging for Hoti, she also has time on her side, thanks to a viewer who saw last week's story.""It just really hit me hard. And I was like, I felt compelled to want to try and do something to help her,"" said the viewer, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid potential scams. ""Unfortunately, with the ... climate in the world today, good deeds, I believe, can get transformed into something bad for the person who's trying to do good.""""I'm not wealthy by any means. But when I looked at my finances and I was like, I am comfortable enough that I can do something for somebody else,"" the donor said.The gesture gives Hoti more than just a roof over her head while she sorts out the ongoing issues with the state.""Honestly, very grateful,"" Hoti said. ""It gives me hope that maybe I can. ... I think any little bit of kindness any of us can put out there for anybody is worth it.""Meanwhile, Hoti's job search continues.

"DeSantis blasts House property tax proposals as 'half measures'","MoneyReal Estate News Gov. Ron DeSantis blasts House property tax proposals as 'half measures' The governor dismissed the House package, saying none of the ideas 'would get people excited' WPTV Gov. Ron DeSantis at a press event in Tampa on Oct. 29, 2025. By: Forrest Saunders Posted and last updated TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Gov. Ron DeSantis made clear Wednesday he's not on board with the Florida House’s multi-pronged approach to property tax reform, calling the chamber’s newly unveiled package ""milquetoast"" and warning it could doom efforts to deliver real relief to homeowners. At a press event in Tampa, DeSantis said the House's eight proposals — seven of which are constitutional amendments — all designed to give voters a menu of options for cutting or capping local property taxes in 2026, are the wrong approach. He argued that offering multiple measures would confuse voters and make it harder for any one proposal to reach the 60% threshold needed for passage. WATCH: DeSantis says House property tax proposals 'offend' him Gov. Ron DeSantis blasts House property tax proposals as 'half measures' ""You have to have one amendment,"" DeSantis said. ""It's got to be very clearly written and give people a chance to vote for it. What you don't do is put five on there. … It offends me because they think you're stupid enough for them to tell you, 'Oh no, we're supportive of you. We put it up. We put stuff on the ballot. We tried.' They can't think you're that stupid, right?"" The governor's comments come two weeks after House Speaker Danny Perez, R–Miami, announced a slate of proposed ballot measures and one bill based on recommendations from the House Select Committee on Property Taxes. Those include options to phase out or eliminate non-school homestead property taxes, add exemptions for seniors and insured homeowners, and tighten limits on how fast property values can rise.Perez framed the effort as a chance to let voters, not politicians, decide. ""If we have faith in the voters to elect us, we should not be afraid to let them be a part of the conversation about the taxes they pay,"" Perez wrote in the Oct. 16 memo.But DeSantis dismissed the House package as uninspired and unserious, saying none of the ideas ""would get people excited."" In response, Perez fired back in a statement Wednesday: The governor’s comments can only be interpreted in two ways. Either he’s being small and petty, or he has just revealed something significant today about his mysterious property tax plan. The House has proposed eliminating all non-school homestead property taxes. The Governor weirdly called that ‘milquetoast.’ That can only mean the Governor has just announced that he will be proposing to abolish all property taxes including school taxes. I look forward to seeing the Governor’s proposed budget where he makes up for the $21 billion for schools that he plans to cut. DeSantis, meanwhile, said his administration is still developing a single, broader amendment — one focused squarely on homesteaded Florida residents, whom he believes should eventually pay no property tax at all. ""You have a home, you're homesteaded. You should own it. You shouldn't be taxed— it shouldn't be an ATM for the local government,"" DeSantis said. ""That’s the vision we want to see.""Still, the governor acknowledged the challenge of structuring such a plan to avoid unintended consequences, like incentivizing out-of-state buyers to flock to Florida or cutting too deeply into local government budgets that fund law enforcement and education.DeSantis also took aim at past legislative drafting practices, complaining that many recent ballot measures have failed because ""some lawyer on staff drafts something nobody can understand."" He said his team is focused on crafting ""clear, simple language"" that voters can trust and understand.Meanwhile, the House readies to move its proposals through the committee process. State Rep. Toby Overdorf, R–Palm City, who co-chairs the property tax panel, said lawmakers intentionally filed multiple resolutions so voters could choose which, if any, to adopt. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Florida House rolls out property tax proposals for 2026 Florida House rolls out property tax proposals for 2026 ballot ""What we're doing and trying to do is to make sure that the residents of Florida, ultimately the voters, will have the opportunity to make a decision as to what they want to do surrounding their property taxes,” Overdorf told Capitol Reporter Forrest Saunders recently. ""If we give voters a variety of choices, that's what we felt was most appropriate."" Democrats, however, have warned that the proposals could devastate local governments. House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell, D–Tampa, said the plan risks undermining essential public services and shifting financial burdens onto smaller counties.""What firehouse would he come and close in Tampa? What police station would he close in Orlando?"" Driskell said. ""Those are the sorts of activities that our property taxes go to, and we would be, I think, leaving the state in local communities in a situation where it would cause harm.""DeSantis brushed off the criticism, saying his administration will protect school and public safety funding while cracking down on wasteful local spending.The governor's final proposal is expected sometime soon, ahead of the 2026 ballot deadline. It could set up another sharp divide between the executive branch and the House, this time over how far, and how fast, Florida should go on property tax reform.

By: Samantha Roesler Posted ST. LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. — St. Lucie County deputies are stepping up enforcement at Blind Creek Beach after reports of people going nude outside the designated area.""While the ongoing Blind Creek Beach renovation project may be a temporary inconvenience to beach goers, it does not permit the use of non-designated public areas as extensions of the designated nude-optional beach,"" the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office wrote.
