He said this is a call to action since the mini-bike was being used illegally and without helmets.“The ultimate thing that we don’t want to happen is what happened this past Saturday,’ said Chief Coleman. “I think the people throughout Palm Beach County need to understand these are not street-legal devices. A lot of these devices should not be on the roadway.”Chief Coleman said even officers struggle to enforce the law at times.“Coming here, I saw two kids on a motorbike, operating on the roadway way and you try to stop them and tell them to stop and they don’t stop,” said Chief Coleman.Chief Coleman is calling for support ahead of the holiday season, when e-bikes and other devices are gifted.“We need a lot of help throughout the community, a lot of education, schools, parents, churches, to let people know that this is a dangerous situation that we’re in,” said Chief Coleman.Mayor Lawson said the city is working on drafting an ordinance to regulate e-bikes, scooters and other devices and riders can face possible penalties if rules are not followed.“These devices are very dangerous. Like anything else, it was created for good, and without the proper training, it can be tragic,” said Chief Coleman.Mayor Lawson said the city will hold a town hall on November 15th to discuss bike safety.

"Local airports face widespread flight delays as shutdown nears record length","LifestyleTravel Government shutdown nears record length as Florida airports face widespread flight delays This weekend proved particularly challenging for air travelers nationwide WPTV By: Kayla McDermott Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — Florida's major airports are experiencing significant disruptions as the government shutdown approaches its longest duration in U.S. history, with nearly 200 flights delayed across Palm Beach International, Orlando International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports. The weekend proved particularly challenging for air travelers nationwide, with thousands of flights delayed or canceled as federal employees, including air traffic controllers and TSA officers, continue working without pay.WATCH: Travel expert says delays are sign that shutdown is 'starting to wear on the system' Florida airports face widespread flight delays as shutdown nears record length Christopher Ripp experienced the delays firsthand when his daughter's flight to New York was severely impacted. ""They flew over Pennsylvania for an hour and a half. They were almost getting ready to get directed back,"" Ripp said. German Estrada, traveling from Detroit, faced similar issues with extended wait times. ""They had us wait on the airplane for about 50 minutes. Once we landed, it was maybe about a 20-minute delay,"" Estrada said.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed roughly 65% of Sunday's nationwide delays to staffing shortages. Air traffic controllers have been working without pay since Tuesday, while TSA officers have gone more than a week without compensation. Travel Orlando International Airport flights delayed up to 11 hours over staffing Scripps News Group Mickey Alston, vice president of PBI Airport and AFGE Local 558, highlighted the financial strain on federal workers. ""How we're going to get to work if we don't have the gas money to put gas in our cars?"" Alston said.Orlando International Airport, Florida's busiest, was forced to turn away all arriving flights Thursday night and recorded nearly 800 delays over the weekend according to FlightAware. Palm Beach International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports combined saw 673 flights depart late during the same period.Travel expert Katy Nastro warns the situation represents a significant escalation from earlier in the month. ""We saw cancellations late in the week last week on Oct. 30, and that's really significant because we haven't seen mass cancellations pretty much throughout this entire period, entire month of October, they were pretty much average, if not below average, and that's a really big signal that things are starting to wear on the system,"" Nastro said. The timing of the shutdown raises particular concerns as the holiday travel season approaches. ""If this government shutdown lasts through the holidays, we could definitely experience a very messy travel week,"" Nastro said. ""We've seen things like ground stops, ground delays. We've seen delays for multiple days across multiple airports,"" Nastro said. ""Things are starting to wear on the system."" Travel TSA workers face paycheck uncertainty as shutdown continues Kayla McDermott The delays particularly impact business travelers like Estrada, an engineer who relies on air travel for work. ""I travel to different plants around the country. Hopefully I don't get delays and I get home in time,"" Estrada said.For travelers facing uncertainty, Nastro recommends purchasing flexible ticket options. ""This could potentially last through the holidays, but there is no way of knowing. The only thing that you can do is make sure that you do buy a main economy ticket to give yourself that flexibility without the added cost on top of being able to make changes if you need to,"" Nastro said.Nastro also advises travelers to book the earliest possible flights during the day to minimize potential delays or cancellations during the ongoing shutdown. ""You want to give yourself as much time to get to the airport and get through processing,"" Nastro said.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

"Oyster shells from local restaurants are helping this lagoon","News Oyster shells from Palm Beach County restaurants helping restore Lake Worth Lagoon A new recycling and restoration program led by the Palm Beach County Fishing Foundation is giving oyster shells from The Breakers and Cod & Capers Seafood a second life by helping restore lagoon WPTV By: Vannia Joseph Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A new local effort is turning restaurant leftovers into a powerful tool for cleaner water. Oyster shells from The Breakersand Cod & Capers Seafood are getting a second life — helping restore the Lake Worth Lagoon through a new recycling and restoration program led by the Palm Beach County Fishing Foundation.WATCH BELOW: 'Oysters are a keystone species in the marine system,' Tom Twyford tells WPTV Oyster shells from Palm Beach County restaurants helping restore Lake Worth Lagoon Foundation executive director Tom Twyford said until recently, Palm Beach County wasn't part of the oyster restoration movement and that the county is catching up to a growing national trend in oyster restoration. ""We really weren't recycling oysters in Palm Beach County, and we saw an opportunity to collect them for locally based restoration,"" he said. ""We're pretty much late to the party on this one, I got to be honest with you.""Each week, Twyford collects hundreds of used shells from restaurants and takes them to John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, where they cure under the Florida sun. Once sanitized, volunteers string the shells on cables to create vertical oyster gardens, hanging underwater structures that give oyster a place to grow. ""The oysters are strung on a piece of cable and suspended in a water column right at the oyster's happy spot right between high tide and low tide, the perfect environment to grow,"" Twyford explained.""Oyster shells are far too valuable of a resource to just send to the landfill,"" Twyford said, demonstrating how the gardens are lowered into the water. Each new oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day, improving clarity and restoring habitat for marine life. But Twyford said these small projects are about more than recycling — they're a response to years of damage. ""There's been a lot of degradation to our water quality over the years, a lot of loss of local habitat like seagrass,"" he said.One of the biggest threats, he explained, is sediment loading — the fine, mucky material that clouds the water and buries seagrass beds after heavy rains or storms. ""Let's say we get a tropical storm, or let's say we get a hurricane — you can see what happens to our waterway,"" Twyford said.He said these oysters are much more than sea life — they're vital to a healthy ecosystem. ""Oysters are a keystone species in the marine system,"" Twyford said. ""They're the most cost-effective, environmentally efficient filtration system we could ever want to have.""But the project is about more than cleaning the water it's also about connecting the community. ""The other beauty of the program,"" Twyford said, ""is the community outreach aspect,"" noting partnerships with local school groups and volunteers who help build the gardens.Still, Twyford admits there's more work ahead. ""We have a problem where, in bodies of water like the Lake Worth Lagoon, the water quality is a really important issue — and it's one that we're not winning the war on,"" he said. Since starting, more than 170 vertical oyster gardens have been installed, including right in residents' backyards in the Village of North Palm Beach, an area leading the charge when it comes to the filtration gardens.Twyford hopes more coastal communities will join the effort. ""If we can get thousands, tens of thousands of vertical gardens suspended in the waterways of Palm Beach County, we'll be making some progress toward water quality and clarity,"" he said. ""It's not going to solve all the problems, but it's going to help a lot.""

"FAU hired GOP-connected firm to investigate professors over Kirk comments","NewsEducation FAU hired GOP-connected firm to investigate professors over Charlie Kirk comments Lead investigator is a former Florida Supreme Court Justice, costing taxpayers close to $1,000 an hour per the contract WPTV received from a public records request. WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated BOCA RATON, Fla. — Florida Atlantic University will pay thousands to investigate professors for their conduct after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, according to documents WPTV obtained from a public records request. Documents show the public university hired an outside legal firm with GOP connections over other internal methods to investigate staff members. At least one of those attorneys appears to have worked for the Republican Party of Florida when current FAU President Adam Hasner served as majority leader for the party in the state’s House of Representatives.WATCH: FAU hires outside legal firm to investigate employees FAU hired GOP-connected firm to investigate professors over Charlie Kirk comments The man overseeing the investigation, according to a letter one of the professors being investigated posted to X, is Alan Lawson. Lawson’s bio at the firm lists him as founding shareholder and a former Florida Supreme Court Justice, appointed by then-Governor Rick Scott (R). He was also appointed to the Fifth District Court of Appeals by then-Governor Jeb Bush (R). Records show taxpayers will pay Lawson’s firm $925 an hour along with $495 for other shareholders, $390 for associates and $225 for paralegals. READ LETTER FROM LAW FIRM: One of those shareholders is Jason Gonzalez, who was a member of the Florida Republican Party Executive Board. A former employer in a press release said Gonzalez was also the general counsel to the Republican Party of Florida as well as the general counsel to the Florida governor and the gubernatorial appointee to the Florida Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission. Gonzalez’s service with the Republican Party came around the same time FAU President Adam Hasner served as the party’s majority leader in the House of Representatives. The firm directed all comments about concerns of impartiality to the school. FAU didn’t respond to WPTV’s inquiries about how the firm was selected to conduct investigations.WHO IS BEING INVESTIGATED?Dr. Karen Leader, an associate professor of art history at FAU, is being investigated after she shared posts on X calling Kirk racist, transphobic and homophobic. She told WPTV in September that she has since deleted a post alleging Kirk used a racial slur after finding it was not true, but left the other posts up, saying she wanted to start a discourse about what she called the “whitewashing of a controversial figure.” “What I did is posted or reposted a lot of content that offered proof that he had said vile things and targeted populations and demonstrated his bigotry, and I was mostly reposting evidence,” Leader said in September. Education EXCLUSIVE: FAU professor placed on leave over Kirk posts speaks to WPTV Michael Hoffman Her attorney, HB Stivers, said he believed the investigation would be fair and impartial because of the integrity of those involved.Dr. Rebel Cole, a professor of finance at FAU, is under scrutiny after posting messages in response to online criticism of Kirk following his assassination. Cole wrote, “We are going to hunt you down” and “We are going to identify you,” according to posts shared on X.Dr. Kate Polak, who is an instructor and research associate at the school’s department of English, is also on paid administrative leave regarding her comments after Kirk’s assassination. University Press, FAU’s student newspaper, said the suspension was over comments she made on her Threads account. WPTV contacted Cole and Polak and didn’t make successful contact.MORE COVERAGE: State Bill threatens state funding if colleges don't rename roads after Charlie Kirk Audra Schroeder Boca Raton Experts weigh in on FAU professor placed on leave after Charlie Kirk post Michael Hoffman Boca Raton FAU faculty member on leave after comments about Charlie Kirk assassination Emma Romano Boca Raton Second FAU professor placed on leave after controversial political posts Michael Hoffman Sign up for our Morning E-mail Newsletter to receive the latest headlines in your inbox. window.addEventListener('message', });","https://www.wptv.com/news/education/fau-hired-gop-connected-firm-to-investigate-professors-over-charlie-kirk-comments"
