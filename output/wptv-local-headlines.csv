WPTV reported in January when the idea of implementing the pay-to-park system was first proposed.Some business owners urged city leaders to reconsider, worrying it would drive people away.

"Seacoast Bank is investing millions into this project in Stuart","NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin CountyStuart Seacoast Bank investing millions in headquarters in downtown Stuart WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted STUART, Fla. — Seacoast Bank is investing millions in a new three-story, 58,647-square-foot headquarters in downtown Stuart, replacing its 60-year-old building at 815 S. Colorado Ave.Approved by the Community Redevelopment Board and the Stuart City Commission, the reconstruction project includes a new headquarters building and a detached parking garage. Bank officials say the redesign is intended to improve safety, walkability, and downtown access while preparing for future growth. Seacoast Bank “This really reaffirms, kind of replants our flag here in Stuart,” said Tracey Dexter, chief financial officer of Seacoast Bank. “It keeps the local experience of this market here in the community. It helps retain the jobs we have and attracts new ones. We’re planning for growth, and in the short term, it provides jobs for all the partners working with us on the construction site.”The project, which will support 225 current staff members and accommodate future expansion, will also create temporary construction jobs during the building phase.“We’re planning a redesign and new headquarters building on our campus in Stuart,” Dexter added. “We have been in Stuart for nearly 100 years, and Seacoast has really integrated with the fabric of this community. We’re just really excited about recommitting.”The existing facility, built in 1961, will be demolished and replaced with a 90,762-square-foot, three-story private parking garage. The new development will also include a drive-thru bank teller, a drive-thru ATM, and other modern banking conveniences.“The building we’re in today has been here for about 60 years,” Dexter said. “While it’s a very strong, stable structure, it’s just functionally obsolete in many ways. It’s not optimal for how we operate today, and our customers need updates, both in technology and in how the space works.”According to bank officials, services will continue at the current location throughout the construction process.On Sept. 22, 2025, the City Commission granted a major Creek District code conditional use approval for the headquarters project.Seacoast Bank officials call the investment a long-term commitment to Stuart and the Treasure Coast. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-martin-county/stuart/seacoast-bank-investing-millions-in-headquarters-in-downtown-stuart"
"City says $27 million golf course renovation is coming—and so are higher fees","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyDelray Beach Delray Beach plans $27 million renovation for golf course: Where’s the money coming from? City manager tells WPTV's Michael Hoffman the plan calls for a mix of higher greens fees and a bond, rather than direct funding from taxpayers WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated DELRAY BEACH, Fla. — Improvements are coming to Delray Beach’s Municipal Golf Course, and city leaders say the long-awaited project will be a “full-scale renovation” — from the greens to the fairways to the clubhouse to the tee boxes.The plan, which city officials estimate will cost about $27 million, could begin as early as November. But before construction gets underway, leaders have to decide how to pay for it. Delray Beach plans $27 million renovation for golf course Golfers who frequent the course say the upgrades are overdue.“I've been here for about a year now,” said Daniel Fisher. I've been playing pretty consistently. It’s really affordable — $33 for 18 holes, $18 for nine. You can’t beat that.”Fisher says he welcomes improvements, as long as the course remains accessible. Let's Hear It These golf club residents concerned are about deteriorating course conditions Zitlali Solache “I’ll never complain about an improvement,” said Fisher. “It just really depends how much that price increase is. If it ends up being $40 a round instead of $33 — not the end of the world.”Delray Beach City Manager Terrence Moore tells WPTV’s Michael Hoffman the plan, to be voted on in the coming weeks, calls for a mix of higher greens fees and a bond, rather than direct funding from taxpayers. Sanford Ferris Golf Design Rendering of updated course “We are very excited about this opportunity,” said Moore. “It is a very realistic and exciting outcome. The city of Delray Beach is actually in the midst of a revenue bond issuance to cover the costs associated with the renovation that is to be supported by user fees or rates via golfers and other patrons of the facility once the renovation is completed.” He added that a residential and nonresidential rate structure will soon go before the city commission — meaning residents could see smaller increases compared to golfers living outside Delray Beach.City officials plan to hold additional meetings in the coming weeks to finalize the funding details before construction begins later this year. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/delray-beach/delray-beach-plans-27-million-renovation-for-golf-course-wheres-the-money-coming-from"
"Teachers in this district set to become highest paid on Treasure Coast","NewsEducation Martin County teachers set to become highest paid on Treasure Coast under tentative deal New salary agreement aims to close pay gaps, boost recruitment, and reward performance following district’s 'A' rating WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted STUART, Fla. — A new tentative salary agreement between the Martin County School District and the Martin County Education Association would make the district’s teachers the highest paid on the Treasure Coast.Following the district’s recent ""A"" rating from the state, the agreement includes salary increases and performance-based compensation.WATCH: District has earmarked nearly $1 million for salary adjustments Martin County teachers set to become highest paid on Treasure Coast under tentative deal “It’s really special,” said parent Cortni Viti. “I mean, especially if they’re being paid well they’re going to be enticed to stay.”The district has earmarked nearly $1 million of the budget to support the salary adjustments. Under the agreement, the starting salary for teachers will increase by $266, with further pay increases varying based on experience levels. Incentives based on performance will also increase by several hundred dollars. “There were still some pay gaps for more veteran teachers depending on the county,” said Derek Lowe, coordinator of public information for the Martin County School District. “This tentative agreement would make us the highest paid district across all steps of the salary schedule.” Back To School Why school districts are reaching across county lines to grow student enrollment Jon Shainman Lowe added that the goal is twofold: to retain current educators and to make the district more competitive in attracting new talent.“Well, I hope it helps us recruit,” Lowe said. “Rewarding teachers for the hard work and encouraging them to keep working hard is what we’re all about.”The Martin County Education Association, which represents teachers, expressed support for the deal, telling us in a statement: As the Martin County School District celebrates its 'A' rating, the Martin County Education Association applauds the School Board’s commitment to recognizing the educators who made it possible. Reaching an agreement that makes our teachers the highest paid on the Treasure Coast is a significant step forward. Grade A teachers deserve Grade A salaries, and MCEA will keep fighting for pay that matches the passion and impact our teachers deliver every day for Martin County’s children. The pay increase is met with support from educators like Karen Kinsley, who says she once worked for the district but left in search of a better salary.“They’re already doing a very fulfilling job that they love,” Kinsley said. “And to match that with more money, better money, is just wonderful.”Parents are also hopeful that the raise will help attract strong candidates that will shape their child's future. “It’ll probably raise the competition of who they're wanting to hire,” said Viti. “I mean they’ll have more of an opportunity to pick exactly what they’re looking for in a teacher.”The tentative agreement still requires final approval from both the teachers union and the Martin County School Board before it can take effect. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/education/martin-county-teachers-set-to-become-highest-paid-on-treasure-coast-under-tentative-deal"
