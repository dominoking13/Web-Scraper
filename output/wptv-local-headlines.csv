Dr. Williamson, a local family nurse practitioner who was born and raised in Jamaica, said her own experiences living through destructive hurricanes in the 1980s inspired her to create the nonprofit.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Boynton Beach doctor heads to Jamaica to help victims of hurricane Melissa “When you have experienced poverty of your own, and now you see others going through the same thing, you put yourself in their position,” said Williamson. “And for this reason, I have always had this desire to always go back.”Last year, her team of doctors, nurses, and medical professionals traveled to assist more than 600 patients after Hurricane Beryl. This time, the impact of Hurricane Melissa has reignited that mission.“My entire family lives there. Many of them have lost their roofs, they have lost their houses,” said Williamson. “They have still can’t find some of my family members, so this is now more personal for me.”Williamson and her team plan to travel to rural areas of Jamaica to provide medical assessments, first aid, and antibiotics while also working to prevent chronic diseases through early intervention.“I’ve just seen extreme devastation. Extreme,’ said Williamson. “Bodies still can’t be found. There’s stench because there are still bodies underneath. The rescue teams-they are doing a great job. But nowhere to live. The houses are damaged. Cuts and bruises and infections.”WPTV reporter Zitlali Solache also spoke with Veroll Smith, a resident of Jamaica, who described the fear of living through the storm.“It was one of the most terrifying experiences,’ said Smith. “In Jamaica, we have a style where we say everything is alright, man, everything will be alright, but everything is not alright. I can tell you that. We are not good, we need the help.”Williamson hopes her organization’s work will bring relief to families like Smith’s. Fifty medical professionals with Living Well Community Care will be on the ground in Jamaica from Nov. 21 through Dec. 6.“I want people to live well and that’s our ultimate goal,” said Williamson.

"Port St. Lucie approves deal for city’s first pro soccer stadium at meeting","SportsSoccer Port St. Lucie approves deal for city’s first pro soccer stadium after heated public meeting City of Port Saint Lucie By: Michael Hoffman Posted PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — It was a heated meeting — and the first chance for the public to speak out at length about the project. In the end, Port St. Lucie city council members unanimously approved three key parts of the deal to bring the city its first professional soccer stadium.As council members gaveled the meeting to order, residents filled the chambers to share their thoughts. Opinions were mixed on the proposed plan to build the city’s first pro soccer stadium, which would bring a USL professional soccer team to Port St. Lucie.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Port St. Lucie approves deal for city’s first pro soccer stadium after heated public meeting While some jumped at the idea:“I fully support it,” said one resident in support of the plan. “I support you guys in what you're doing, and I commend you for bringing in a good project.”“Coming from a 41-year-old millennial, I am downright excited about this,” said Mark Bryant, also in support. “So let's get this done.”Others voiced strong opposition.“Not one time did anybody in my community in this neighborhood say this is what we want,” said Jennifer Harris.“I would like to know what we're going to do if this thing fails, and everybody here got to foot the bill, what are we going to do?” asked concerned resident Steven Russo.Many residents shared concerns about traffic, noise, and funding — issues the council addressed before taking the final vote.Mayor Shannon Martin said the city had carefully reviewed the project.“We have vetted this completely; we have gone over this with a fine-toothed comb, and all of the traffic issues will be addressed.”She also emphasized that taxpayers won’t be left footing the bill.“The city is not subsidizing in any way, shape or form this stadium or any operational or maintenance costs as it relates to the stadium.”City officials say no public money will be spent until the stadium opens. The $27 million reimbursement will be paid out over 20 years, pending annual approval. Only property tax increases from the stadium’s zone will be used, meaning neighbors won’t see higher taxes.Tuesday’s vote locks in both the funding and operating agreements, securing the stadium project for decades to come.We are working to learn when construction will begin, with plans to be ready for the team’s first match by March 2027.

"Martin County residents divided over growth after minimal raise in population","NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin County Martin County residents divided over growth as officials report population up just 1.23% While longtime residents say the county is losing its small town charm, new data shows growth remains steady and below 2% a year. WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — Longtime residents say it’s impossible not to notice how much Martin County has changed over the years.“As far as growth, I see the natural flora being decimated,” said John Wrobleuski, a Martin County resident of over 20 years.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Martin County residents divided over growth as officials report population up just 1.23% Families who have moved to the area more recently say they’ve also noticed more development.“It’s just expanding so much there are more buildings,” said resident Cheryl Layton.Despite those perceptions, county data suggests the growth may not be as rapid as it appears. Martin County staff told commissioners at a Tuesday morning meeting that the population increased by 1.23% in 2024.“Steady growth,” said Clyde Dulin, comprehensive planning administrator for Martin County Growth Management. “We’ve had some increases in growth, but it’s all been less than 2% for the last four years — five years.”Some residents, like Stuart resident Luseni, believe that consistent growth is important for the community’s progress.“There’s no such thing as no growth, you either grow or you digress,” he said.Others question the data and say even small annual increases can add up over time.“The population growth, as far as I’m concerned, has been enormous,” Wrobleuski said.“For my grandkids, when they’re older, it’s just going to be too expensive — no green space,” Layton added.County staff also presented information on residential capacity within the Urban Service District, noting there is still room for future development.“We have enough residential capacity in our Urban Service Districts to serve the projected housing needs for the next 10 and 20 years,” Dulin said.The presentation comes as commissioners prepare to discuss whether to expand the Urban Service District at a board meeting scheduled for Nov. 18.For now, residents remain divided on whether growth in Martin County should slow down or continue at its current pace.Portions of this story were assisted by artificial intelligence tools and reviewed by a WPTV journalists to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to editorial standards.

That's the biggest one,"" one resident said when asked about financial pressures.WATCH BELOW: Florida residents weigh leaving state over rising expenses Poll: Florida residents weigh leaving state over rising expenses The findings come as a surprise to researchers, given Florida's traditional appeal as an escape from high-cost northern states.""I may have guessed that Floridians were happier than everybody else, but maybe that trend isn't bearing out,"" said Eric Levy, the assistant director of FAU's Business and Economic Polling Initiative (BEPI).

Any bike going more than 28 mph or having a motor of at least 750 watts would be treated as an ""electric motorcycle"" — the type Lundy was riding.Under the proposed law, such bikes would need to be registered, riders would need a driver's license, and the vehicles could not be used on sidewalks or bike lanes.The state would also add motorized bikes into crash reports, and the crash dashboard would include all motorized bikes.

"College appeals ruling blocks land transfer for Trump library","NewsTrump College appeals ruling blocking Miami land transfer for Trump presidential library Land is valued at more than $67 million AP Photo/Marta Lavandier Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is proposing that President Donald Trump's presidential library be built in a parking lot that is currently used by Miami Dade College staff and faculty and is adjacent to the Freedom Tower, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025, in Miami. By: Kate Payne Posted MIAMI — The board of a South Florida college is appealing a judge's ruling temporarily blocking officials from giving away a parcel of prime real estate in downtown Miami to be used for President Donald Trump's future presidential library.Attorneys for the District Board of Trustees of Miami Dade College filed a notice of appeal in Florida's 3rd District Court of Appeal on Tuesday, challenging a lower court's injunction that bars the transfer of the property — at least for now. Trump Presidential Library planned for downtown Miami, sparking backlash Last month, Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz sided with a Miami activist who alleged that college officials violated Florida's open government law when they gifted the sizable plot of real estate to the state. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top Florida officials then voted to transfer the property to the foundation for the planned library.Marvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed the lawsuit arguing that the college board violated Florida's Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land.The nearly 3-acre property is a developer's dream and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One real estate expert wagered that the parcel — one of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard — could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more.The parties are expected to appear before the Miami-Dade judge again on Nov. 24, when attorneys for the college plan to ask that court to stay its proceedings, pending the appellate court's review.

I will continue to work with the Office of Insurance Regulation to ensure that Florida’s insurance market is working for its insurance policyholders and that insurance companies are adhering to their requirements.""""Claims management practices must always be efficient and fair, especially after Hurricanes,"" Yaworsky said. ""I have said it before, and will say it again, the Office of Insurance Regulation takes consumer protection very seriously. I implore all insurers to review their practices and perform at the high caliber we expect. I am also very proud of our team’s efforts in holding insurers accountable and want to commend their efforts — OIR's Market Conduct Unit has initiated over 100 examinations, completed more than 340 investigations and secured $14.5 million in consumer restitution.""The OIR said it has also secured about $14.5 million in consumer restitution since insurance reforms were passed by lawmakers.
