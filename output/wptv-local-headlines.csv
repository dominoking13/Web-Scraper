"Martin County teacher gets administrative hearing after Facebook post","NewsEducation Martin County teacher's case heads to administrative hearing after school board vote Matthew Theobald’s future will be determined by an administrative law judge WPTV By: Zitlali Solache Posted MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — Matthew Theobald’s future could soon be in the hands of an administrative law judge.On Tuesday, school board members voted 3-2, to allow an administrative hearing for Theobald, meaning a third party would take the case.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Martin County teacher's case heads to administrative hearing after school board vote Theobald, a teacher and president of the Martin County teachers union, was suspended without pay after calling Charlie Kirk a “racist, misogynistic, fear-mongering neo-nazi” on Facebook.“Matt is not just a teacher; he goes above and beyond when anyone is in need,” said his wife, Kaylin Rowell. “You all should be ashamed of yourselves. I also do not need to tell you that these actions are also highly unconstitutional.”While dozens of supporters attended the meeting, others also called for his termination.“You are free to say what you want,” said Elizabeth Cain. “You’re not free to call people racist, misogynists.”Theobald’s attorney, Martin Powell, spoke with WPTV after the school district’s decision.“That was a safe space for him because those are conversations he has with his family and friends,” said Powell. “It’s what makes America great, the exchange of ideas.”Weeks after Theobald’s suspension, Powell filed a request, asking for a fair hearing through the state.“We’re surprised but excited about the results,” said Powell. “I think we’ll get a third party to actually evaluate the facts and evaluate the case.”In the letter, Theobald’s attorney calls for the district to reverse his suspension, termination recommendation, and provide back pay. Powell said this will assure a fair trial.“Instead of having the political body that is the school board be the ultimate arbitrator, judge, 'an executioner', or as they say, I’m excited about having a third-party review it,” said Powell.The hearing should be held within 60 days.

"Teachers report no background checks at this Fort Pierce school","NewsEducation Teachers report no background checks at this Fort Pierce school State law requires school employees receive level two background checks WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Multiple teachers at Creative Learning Lab Academy tell WPTV they didn’t receive legally required background checks before they started working with children as young as Kindergarten.The Florida Department of Children and Families said it is still working to get our news team information about any possible investigation or regulatory action against the school’s owners for more than a month. Our news team previously discovered the school wasn’t paying teachers on time, which led the school to close and then reopen within a 24-hour period. The school, according to a letter WPTV obtained, shows that the school officials closed earlier in October.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Teachers report no background checks at this Fort Pierce school State law requires teachers and any other school employee to get a level two background investigation. Those investigations include sending fingerprints to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which did tell WPTV it had some prints on file for the Fort Pierce private school. However, multiple employees told WPTV they didn’t receive any background checks before entering the school even though offer letters said a successful “background screening” was required for employment.""They just did that out of formality to make it look like they were doing it,” said a teacher, who spoke to WPTV on the condition of anonymity due to possible retaliation and possible consequences on her professional teaching license as a mandatory reporter. “…The more we pushed and the more we questioned, they got agitated and upset.“This teacher said it raised a “red flag” about the school because she used to teach in a public school where background checks were required. For example, this teacher said she just had a drug screening performed before she could shadow a teacher leaving a public school to take over her position. Another teacher at the school told WPTV he never performed any activity to turn over his fingerprints before he started teaching elementary school children.Chris and Balanga Madison own the school, according to its website. When WPTV’s Ethan Stein reached out to Chris about the lack of background checks into his staff, he declined to deny those allegations and texted us a statement about the difficulties of running a private school.“Thank you for all you do to ensure the safety of our children and also exposing what a struggle it is to educate the children in our community,” Chris wrote.The school, according to Step Up for Students, received about $44,000 from taxpayer-funded scholarships from students attending the school. One teacher told WPTV that Madison branded the school as a place to educate underprivileged children in a private setting that offered free lunch, but the school lacked textbooks and materials for teachers and students, as well as a kitchen. Teachers also told WPTV the kids didn’t get uniforms even after parents handed over hundreds of dollars.Eventually, the school told teachers they were struggling to make payroll costs in August. Then, teachers, who were scared to speak to WPTV for fear of losing their job, told WPTV staff started to leave.""At any moment, the doors can close,"" a Creative Learning Lab Academy teacher, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job, told WPTV in September. ""We are struggling as much as they [parents] are struggling with what's going on. The people who are still there do care about the kids. We all do care about the school and want it to work. But, we're not sure it's going to (work).""He said the departures have caused class sizes to grow. Staff members also claimed the school has been giving parents false reasons for teacher absences, such as saying employees are sick.""We don't want to leave them astray,"" the teacher told WPTV. ""But, you feel like at any point the doors may close.""The Florida Department of Education said it monitors compliance of the state’s background check law through the annual renewal process and can take regulatory action, including suspension or removal from scholarship participation, if a school fails to meet statutory requirements. It directed us to ask question about potential investigations to law enforcement, who directed our questions to the Department of Education, and the Department of Children and Families.

"Residents sound off on Boca Raton Beach and Park district proposals","MoneyReal Estate News Residents sound off on Boca Raton Beach and Park district proposals WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted BOCA RATON, Fla. — The debate over the future of Boca Raton’s North Park area is heating up again and this week, all eyes are on the Greater Boca Raton Beach and Park District.Following Monday’s public meeting, residents are weighing in on what kind of development they want to see replace the now-defunct Ocean Breeze Golf Course. The discussion centers on several proposals being reviewed as part of a formal request for proposals (RFP) process.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Residents sound off on Boca Raton Beach and Park district proposals At the meeting, district leaders discussed multiple competing plans, including the top-ranked Boca Surf Park, a golf course redevelopment, and a sports and entertainment facility. If approved by commissioners, each could bring a multi-million-dollar private investment.“We may take one, we may take all three, we may take two, or it could be any or all of the above,” said Briann Harms, executive director of the Beach and Park District.Harms said the district is taking a deep look at each company’s proposal to ensure the project aligns with the community’s recreational goals.“The goal is filling a recreational need,” Harms said. “If we can get some revenue to offset the operational costs, but the number one priority is providing a recreational need.”But for homeowners who live nearby, the excitement over new amenities is tempered by concern. Residents say they’re worried about traffic, noise, and property values if large-scale projects move forward in their neighborhood.“There are any number of places in the Boca community where this could be built without affecting pre-existing residential neighborhoods,” said Joel Lavintman, a homeowner in the San de Vance community.Here’s a look at the major proposals under consideration:Boca Surf Park: A $60 million project that could generate an estimated $25–40 million in economic impact and create 80 to 100 direct jobs. Plans include a 49-year concession term with two 25-year renewal options and a year-round operating schedule. Boca Sports and Entertainment Facility: A 40,000-square-foot indoor complex featuring six basketball courts (convertible to six to eight volleyball courts), 4,000 square feet of indoor turf for speed and agility training, and a 36-foot-high central ceiling. Municipal Golf Partners (Kemper Golf): A proposed short course with a 30–35 bay covered driving range. Developers say they’re prepared to invest up to $20 million, with projected district revenues exceeding $36 million over a 56-year term.YMCA partnership proposal: A plan focused on youth and sports wellness programs, summer camps, and potential future aquatic facilities in collaboration with the Beach and Park District. District officials say no decision has been made yet. They’re still waiting on key financial and operational details from each proposal before moving forward.There’s also no set timeline for when commissioners will make a final decision.“We want to continue to hear from the residents. Their feedback and their input have a lot of weight with our board and I think it's important that they keep engaging in this process,” Harms said.

Matt Slocum/AP Jack Nicklaus waves before hitting the first tee for the honorary tee off before the first round of the Masters golf tournament, April 9, 2015, in Augusta, Ga. By: AP via Scripps News Group Posted Professional golf legend Jack Nicklaus has won a $50 million verdict in a defamation lawsuit filed in Florida against his former business partners.A six-person jury in Palm Beach County found Monday that the Nicklaus Companies had damaged the 18-time major champion’s reputation and exposed him to ridicule, hatred, mistrust, distrust or contempt. Nicklaus Companies owner and executive chairman Howard Milstein and executive Andrew O'Brien were also named individually as defendants, but jurors did not find them personally liable.Eugene Stearns, an attorney for Nicklaus, said Nicklaus has spent his life helping others and earning a reputation as not just a great athlete but a great human being.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Tiger Woods undergoes seventh back surgery in 11 years to replace collapsed disk“He deserved better than what he got, and we’re pleased that the jury addressed the particular circumstances that were so annoying,” Stearns said.According to the lawsuit, Nicklaus, 85, claimed Milstein, O’Brien and others at the company spread false stories that Nicklaus considered a $750 million deal to join the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV Golf League and that he was suffering from dementia and no longer mentally fit to manage his affairs.Defense attorneys said at trial that Nicklaus Companies executives never tried to defame Nicklaus and argued the case was basically a business dispute. They said no harm was done to Nicklaus' reputation, and there was no reason for a company that shared the golfer's name to attack him.Attorneys for Nicklaus Companies didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday evening.Earlier this year, a New York judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Nicklaus Companies against Nicklaus that attempted to prevent the golfer from using his name, image and likeness to promote his golf course design business.Nicklaus joined Nicklaus Companies in 2007 as part of a $145 million deal, but Nicklaus eventually quit and planned to continue designing golf courses on his own. While Nicklaus is once again free to design golf courses under his own name, Nicklaus Companies retains the rights to sell clothing and equipment with “Jack Nicklaus” logos.

WATCH: Martin County law enforcement shares rare insight into controversial detention facility Martin County deputy details Alligator Alcatraz experience ""For something that was constructed on such short notice, it was extremely impressive from a logistical standpoint,"" McCarthy said.The deployment is part of a year-long mission stretching through next June. McCarthy said the governor's office asked all sheriff's offices in Florida to send teams to the site on a weekly rotating basis.The deputies' role focused strictly on security operations, including checkpoint management and perimeter protection. They did not interact with detainees housed at the facility.""We do not interact with the detainees at all. We had no interaction. They're within the fenced-in detention facility.

Jamie Ostroff McCarthy described seeing numerous detainees being transported in and out of the facility but characterized his team's overall deployment as uneventful.He noted that protesters and demonstrators who remained near the facility appeared experienced and stayed off the property.""A lot of the people that are still there are more of your seasoned protesters or demonstrators. So they knew what they could and couldn't do. They stayed off the property,"" McCarthy said.McCarthy offered insight into conditions at the facility, which has been largely hidden from public view behind fences and security barriers.""You watch the news, and that's a lot of your perception and what you build in your head, and there was a lot of negative connotation surrounding the facility itself,"" McCarthy said.He described the facility as well-organized and focused on safety protocols.""It was extremely clean. It was extremely well-run, well put together and organized,"" McCarthy said. ""It's very much geared towards safety, and they're not looking to have any incidents.

For city planners, community voices are the cornerstone of the plan. Florida requires every city to update its comprehensive plan regularly, and Boynton Beach leaders said they want this one to reflect the needs and priorities of the people who live here.Some residents voiced frustration over the pace of development. ""We moved in and they had all the mangroves around us — isn't that nice? And now we find out, all of a sudden, they approved multi-million dollar condos,"" one resident said. Others said they're concerned about overdevelopment and losing the city's natural character. ""I'm frustrated with all the concrete going up, and the horizon that I'm losing,"" another resident said. Many participants at the workshop said they'd like to see the city focus on redevelopment rather than expanding into new areas — and on reconnecting neighborhoods long divided by I-95. ""Right now, the community is divided by I-95, obviously,"" one resident shared.City staff say feedback like this will help shape key elements of the plan, which covers housing, transportation, economic vitality, and environmental resilience. ""Healthcare is going to be here forever, and with an aging population, there's a lot of opportunities there we haven't taken advantage of, and we need to,"" another resident added.City data shows the 25-to-44-year-old population continues to grow — another sign that Boynton Beach is evolving. Some longtime residents said that change brings new opportunity. ""I think there's a lot more opportunities here in housing and careers. A lot of the times people used to leave the city, and now I think more people are staying,"" one resident said.Next steps include integrating public feedback into draft elements of the plan, updating maps and policies, and holding another public workshop before the city commission reviews the updated plan. City staff estimate the process could take 33 to 40 weeks to complete — a long-term vision built on listening to residents and planning for the next generation of Boynton Beach.

""All of that is now appearing to kick in, so they have to roll back the money.""A statement from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation states the following:""If excess profits are found, our regulatory team works together with our legal team to draft a consent order which orders the company to return the excess profits to policyholders…""The money — either a check or a policy credit — is slated to go to Progressive personal auto policyholders who are active clients as of Dec. 31, 2025, according to paperwork filed with the SEC.""It's going to compare to whatever their policy was. So, it won't be, 'Let's just give out the money to everyone.' It'll vary by client,"" Norberg said.A Progressive spokesperson sent WPTV the following statement regarding the credits:""Progressive strives to match price to risk as closely as possible and regularly adjusts rates to ensure we remain appropriately priced for the risk we insure. In the past year, on two separate occasions, Progressive meaningfully reduced rates for Florida personal auto policyholders. Since Florida insurance reforms were enacted in early 2023, we have had lower than anticipated loss severity and frequency in this market. Despite our ongoing actions to match price to risk, Progressive currently estimates that it will exceed the statutory profit limit that a Florida statute imposes for this specific line of business and is preparing to return excess profit to our Florida personal auto policyholders, consistent with Progressive’s goal to deliver sustainable value to our customers and comply with Florida regulations. Progressive currently expects Florida personal auto policyholders active as of December 31, 2025, will receive a credit in 2026. The actual credit amount for each policyholder will vary in proportion to each auto policy’s earned premium during calendar year 2025 and will depend on final year-end financial results for 2025.

"Virginia Giuffre raped by 'well-known Prime Minister,' memoir claims","NewsEpstein Virginia Giuffre raped by 'well-known Prime Minister,' US version of posthumous memoir claims 'I believed that I might die a sex slave,' Giuffre writes Bebeto Matthews/AP Virginia Roberts Giuffre holds a news conference outside a Manhattan court following the jailhouse death of Jeffrey Epstein, Aug. 27, 2019, in New York. By: Christian Edwards, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, CNN Posted and last updated LONDON — Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking ring, wrote in her posthumous memoir that she was brutally beaten and raped by an unidentified prime minister and that she feared she might ""die a sex slave.""""In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people. I was habitually used and humiliated — and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied,"" Giuffre wrote of Epstein and his circle. ""I believed that I might die a sex slave.""WATCH BELOW: The Making of ""Filthy Rich"": The Epstein Story The Making of Filthy Rich: The Epstein Story (28 minutes) Six months after her death by suicide in Australia, Giuffre's memoir ""Nobody's Girl"" was published Tuesday and contains harrowing details of the abuse she allegedly suffered as a teenager, and her years attempting to get justice for herself and her fellow victims.In the U.S. version, Giuffre claims she was raped by a man whom she had ""taken pains to describe in my legal filings only as a 'well-known Prime Minister.'"" In the UK version, the passages are almost identical but refer to the man as a ""former minister."" It was not clear what accounted for the discrepancy.While on the sex offender's Caribbean island, Giuffre described how Epstein ""trafficked me to a man who raped me more savagely than anyone had before."" She wrote that she was 18 at the time.""He repeatedly choked me until I lost consciousness and took pleasure in seeing me fear for my life. Horrifically, the Prime Minister laughed when he hurt me and got more aroused when I begged him to stop,"" she wrote.""Afterward, I tearfully begged Epstein not to send me back to him,"" Giuffre wrote. ""I got down on my knees and pleaded with him. I don't know if Epstein feared the man or if he owed him a favor, but he wouldn't make any promises, saying coldly of the politician's brutality, 'You'll get that sometimes.'"" Epstein Epstein survivor recounts the meeting that changed everything Alexandra Miller The memoir will intensify a transatlantic scandal over the proximity of the rich and powerful to Epstein, which has claimed political scalps in Britain and, for months wracked Congress in the United States. Its publication will heap fresh scrutiny on Prince Andrew, the disgraced British royal accused by Giuffre of sexually assaulting her while she was a teenager. Andrew, who's King Charles' brother, vehemently denies the accusations against him.Facing further public outrage over his relationship with Epstein, Andrew announced last week he had relinquished the use of his royal titles and would no longer be known as the Duke of York, saying: ""I have decided, as I always have, to put duty to my family and country first."" He will, however, retain the title of ""prince,"" since he is the son of the late Queen Elizabeth II.While Buckingham Palace would have hoped Andrew's decision could mark the end of a scandal that has plagued the royal family for years, the latest revelations in Giuffre's memoir will likely deepen the prince's disgrace.Among those is Giuffre's claim that Andrew's ""team"" tried to hire online ""trolls"" to harangue her around the time she brought a civil case against the prince in New York. Giuffre alleged that, having been trafficked by Epstein, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17. Epstein UK charities cut ties to Sarah Ferguson over email calling Epstein a 'friend' AP via Scripps News Group Despite claiming never to have met her, Andrew reportedly paid millions to settle the civil case in 2022. Writing of that settlement, Giuffre said: ""After casting doubt on my credibility for so long — Prince Andrew’s team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me — the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well.""The allegation that Andrew tried to hire trolls comes after the Mail on Sunday, a British paper, reported that Andrew in 2011 asked a police officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on Giuffre. London's Metropolitan Police said it was ""actively looking into"" the report.Another damaging report found that Andrew had kept up his friendship with Epstein two months after he insisted he had broken it off. In a disastrous 2019 BBC interview, in which Andrew's attempt to clear his name backfired spectacularly, the prince insisted he had broken off his friendship with Epstein during a walk in New York’s Central Park in December 2010.Newly unearthed emails have contradicted that claim. The Mail on Sunday reported that, in February 2011, a day after the British press published an image of the prince with his arm around the teenage Giuffre, Andrew wrote to Epstein: ""It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it. Otherwise, keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon!!!!""The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. Discovery Company.

The club is one of several nonprofits that work with Main Street Fort Pierce to make the ghost tours happen.""If you want to get involved, if you really don't know anybody and want to get connected, you can get involved through Main Street,"" Holland said.Pat DeShong dove headfirst into helping nonprofits when she moved back to the area a few years ago.At a recent WPTV Let's Hear It event in Juno Beach, she wanted to sound a clarion call for senior community involvement.""I also see so many seniors like myself out there, and we have so much to offer. Most of us have so much emotional intelligence. We don't get uptight about certain things or stressed out that if you're younger, you do, or I used to when I was younger,"" said DeShong.DeShong has volunteered with animal rescue groups and police organizations.She said volunteering could lead to a full-time job, and it's a great opportunity to meet other people.""Get out and volunteer because there are so many great causes that need our help,"" DeShong said.A study by the University of Maryland values volunteer time at $34.79 per hour.
