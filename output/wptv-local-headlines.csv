"Runoff set for Fort Pierce District 2 City Commission seat","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyFort Pierce Runoff set for Fort Pierce District 2 City Commission seat after special election The runoff election is scheduled for January 13, 2026, and only District 2 residents will be eligible to vote WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated FORT PIERCE, Fla. — The race for Fort Pierce’s next City Commissioner isn’t over yet. With no candidate winning a majority in Tuesday’s special election, voters will head back to the polls in January for a runoff between Chris Dzadovsky and Jaimebeth Galinis.The District 2 seat has been vacant since James Taylor resigned earlier this year following 24 counts of child exploitation charges. His resignation forced the city to call a special election to fill his position.For residents like Iola Mosley, who has called Fort Pierce home for nearly a decade, the process has been frustrating. Runoff set for Fort Pierce District 2 City Commission seat after special election “I love Fort Pierce,” Mosley said. “Everyone is polite, you know. And it's a good feeling when you know your neighbors are really neighbors and look out for you. And that's what I get from Fort Pierce.”But she says that the sense of trust has been shaken.“To have this expense and to have to be forced to have a special election, it just breaks my heart,” Mosley said.The city says the runoff election will cost roughly $60,000 — money that some voters say could be spent elsewhere.“It is a lot. Yeah, that is not ideal,” said Marie-Ann Kessler.“There are other things that you could put the money towards — beautifying the city, beautifying certain parts of Fort Pierce — but you can't put that money towards that now, because now you have to do a runoff election,” said Pamela Turner.Voters tell WPTV that what they want most in their next commissioner is simple: accountability.“We need more accountability,” Turner said.The runoff election is scheduled for January 13, 2026, and only District 2 residents will be eligible to vote.

"How IRC schools might address low enrollment and financial concerns","NewsEducation Indian River County schools consider restructuring to address low enrollment and financial concerns District leaders say changes could include combining schools and adding programs, while parents express concern about possible impacts. WPTV The School District of Indian River County's headquarters during the 2023-24 academic year. By: Cassandra Garcia Posted VERO BEACH, Fla. — The School District of Indian River County is considering major restructuring over the next two years as it looks for ways to increase enrollment and remain financially stable.Currently, the district is operating at a 72% capacity with a goal of reaching more than 90%. Superintendent Dr. David Moore said new programs could help attract more students and prevent financial strain.“If we want to hold true to the structures that are not yielding full schools, we will be financially bankrupt,” Moore said. Indian River County schools face funding concerns That statement has raised concerns among some parents, including Michael Marsh.“When you hear the word bankrupt, that’s a heck of a word to use, a very scary word,” Marsh said.At a recent board meeting, Superintendent Moore explained that the district may need to combine or move some schools while developing innovative ways to appeal to families.“If we don’t right-size and enhance what we’re offering to our community, then we will—shame on us,” Moore said.Marsh said he worries that merging schools could lead to overcrowding and affect the district’s A-rating.“You’re not [just] changing a school name. You’re deciding to send all these students to these schools,” he said.Superintendent Moore emphasized that any changes will be rolled out gradually and with community input.“It will not be a rushed process, it will not be a process in which things are happening in isolation,” Moore said. “We’re probably taking the hardest, longest, most complex way of doing this work, but it’s the right way.”Some of the feedback has already begun. In a statement to WPTV, the superintendent said, ""conversations with school leaders began in early October, followed by teacher and staff meetings during the week of October 27 at Glendale Elementary, Oslo Middle, Osceola Magnet, Rosewood Magnet, Sebastian Elementary, Storm Grove Middle, and the Freshman Learning Center.""The next step will involve gathering input from families at all affected schools. Family and informational sessions are scheduled for Nov. 11–13, with additional town hall meetings planned later in November in both North and South County.Marsh said he hopes the district listens closely to community voices.“This can’t come from up top. We need to hear from everyone, so I guess it’s kind of mixed emotions,” he said.Portions of this story were assisted by artificial intelligence tools and reviewed by a WPTV journalist to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to editorial standards.

"These are the 4 cities in Palm Beach County New Yorkers are relocating to","MoneyReal Estate News Surge of New Yorkers relocating to these 4 Palm Beach County cities, real estate agents say WPTV's Joel Lopez is uncovering that many NYC residents have already initiated what’s being dubbed the 'Mamdani Migration' as people are looking to make South Florida their new home full-tim WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — All eyes are on South Florida from New York City residents, wanting to move from the Big Apple now that Zohran Mamdani is officially the NYC Mayor.WATCH BELOW: 'The last two weeks, it’s been completely a game changer,' CEO Talbot Sutter tells WPTV's Joel Lopez These are the 4 cities in Palm Beach County New Yorkers are relocating to The recent political shift in New York City, with Mamdani built his campaign around making New York City more affordable, but his policies have raised concerns among some about potential tax increases and policy changes from his administration. WPTV has uncovered that many NYC residents have already initiated what’s being dubbed the “Mamdani Migration” as people are looking to make South Florida their new home full-time.Rising demand in real estateThe real estate offices of Sutter & Nugget in North Palm Beach told WPTV's Joel Lopez, the Palm Beach County market is getting a surge in demand.“The last two weeks, it’s been completely a game changer,"" said CEO Talbot Sutter.He said his NYC clients have been a mix of seniors, families, residents and workers whose companies are relocating to South Florida.To meet this surging demand, Sutter shared that they are “having to hire more members to our team to handle the demand from New Yorkers wanting to move down.”So, where are NYC residents looking to move down to? National Politics Mamdani makes history in NYC mayor’s race: 'We have toppled a political dynasty' Scripps News Group Sutter revealed that the top cities his NYC clients are targeting include Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens, Delray Beach, and Boca Raton.Impacts from the migration was further evidenced by recent offers.""We’ve had directly two offers that were stalemated over the summer that we’ve had three showings Monday and Tuesday and offers today, Wednesday. Because of the race. Directly out of the buyer's mouth, they said they were waiting until Wednesday, and we got the offer this morning,"" Sutter said, emphasizing that issues surrounding taxes and quality of life are significant motivators for these NYC transplants.In the past few years, Sutter estimates that around 30,000 New York residents have moved into Palm Beach County and Broward County.Inventory concerns“As far as inventory goes, are you seeing room for all these people?” Lopez asked.“I’m seeing a lot of what I call a 'coke bottle' effect where it's an influx of people, and not enough inventory. Some people say inventory is up right now. We were just looking at stats this morning 56% from year to year, but that inventory is also being scooped up in the last month like that,"" Sutter replied.Despite the year-to-year increase in inventory, Sutter insists that “that inventory is also being scooped up in the last month like that.”Boca Raton's appealOn Tuesday, WPTV spoke with Boca Raton Mayor Scott Singer about the city’s efforts to attract NYC businesses and have them relocate their corporate offices to the Boca Raton.After hearing concerns from Boca Raton residents on the growth this may create, Lopez posed the question: “Wouldn’t you say that also some residents in New York would also see the opportunity to come down here as residents?”Singer acknowledged the potential influx.“We will expect to see that, but we can’t accommodate everyone,"" Singer stated. ""We’re a fairly built-out city. We might have people trying to buy homes here but we're not building to accommodate everyone who wants to come from New York.” WATCH BELOW: 'We’re focused on the businesses,' Mayor Scott Singer tells WPTV Could NYC mayoral election trigger surge in migration to South Florida He elaborated that new building projects aren’t primarily aimed at incoming residents but focus on creating space for NYC businesses that have already committed to relocating to the area.Singer calls Boca Raton the economic engine of Palm Beach County, highlighting that it is home to 40 publicly traded companies from industries such as financial services, financial technology, medical technology, AI, quantum computing, manufacturing and more. “I think that's great; it provides the job and economic vitality we need in ensuring jobs for the next generation and beyond,” Singer remarked.Economic impactSutter acknowledges the potential for increased traffic but suggests “where companies come, residents will follow.”He noted New York residents alone have contributed $9.2 billion in revenue to South Florida.Sutter went through his inventory platform and told WPTV there are over 5,000 single-family houses available for purchase throughout Palm Beach County. Politics Could NYC mayoral election trigger surge in migration to South Florida? Joel Lopez However, Sutter fears that this inventory may not be enough, predicting they could be sold within the next three months from the surge in NYC residents.“I've seen West Palm as the Wall Street—not the new Wall Street—and I see the area exploding,” he warned.To navigate the shifting landscape, Sutter has observed that his NYC clients are open to settling in communities further west.He said he has also heard from people in states like Illinois and California expressing interest in South Florida.Advice for potential moversDespite the fervent interest in relocating, Sutter advises potential movers to take their time. “Don't rush into a property and research the areas,” he advised.He recommends buying property in a neighborhood that is in close proximity to work, ensuring a smoother transition for new residents.

"Family of woman killed after seeking help from police files lawsuit","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoynton Beach Family of Boynton Beach woman killed after seeking help from police files wrongful death lawsuit Nearly 2 years after Fridelene Daniel was shot and killed outside her home, her family is suing the city and a police officer they say failed to protect her WPTV Police body came footage of Fridelene Daniel. By: Ange Toussaint Posted and last updated BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — Nearly two years after a Boynton Beach mother was shot and killed outside her home, her family is suing the city and a police officer they say failed to protect her, even after she went to police for help.“I really don’t understand how my mother walked inside of a police station, a man that is threatening her life followed her in there, and the officer thinks it was just OK to let them walk out,” said Fridelene Daniel’s daughter.WATCH: Daughter says police failed to protect her mother Family files wrongful death suit against Boynton Beach Daniel was killed outside her Boynton Beach apartment in November 2023, just hours after she filed a complaint against her ex-boyfriend, Robens Cesar. “Even looking at the video, Robens is there menacing my mother,” her daughter said. She was just 16 years old at the time. “I got a phone call from my aunt and she was freaking out, saying I heard gunshots,” she recalled.Now, Daniel’s daughter has filed a wrongful death lawsuit accusing the city of Boynton Beach and Officer Jermaine Jones of failure to protect her mother from Cesar. Frideline Daniel Complaint by Megan Agugliaro “Somebody walks in, asks you for help and you do absolutely nothing, you just let them walk out,” she said.According to police reports, Daniel told Officer Jones that Cesar was following her and that he owned a gun. Body cam video shows Cesar standing inside the Boynton Beach Police Department lobby as Daniel made her complaint that morning. You can hear Daniel tell police, “He keeps following me. I don’t want that.”Cesar later told investigators he “couldn’t stand to see Daniel with another man.” An internal affairs investigation later revealed Officer Jones claimed there was some misunderstanding at first, saying Daniel, who was from Haiti and spoke with a Creole accent, may have been misunderstood when she said the word “gun.” Jeff Ringrose/WPTV Robens Cesar, 41, appears in court in Palm Beach County, Fla. on Nov. 9, 2023. The lawsuit alleges Officer Jones failed to conduct a proper investigation and neglected to take immediate action to ensure Daniel’s safety.“We have a police force that took an oath to serve and protect,” said attorney Gary Susser, who represents Daniel’s daughter.Officer Jones was suspended for two weeks following the internal investigation, but Susser says that isn’t enough. “When you have a woman seeking help, literally being stalked and harassed, and literally followed into the police station, nothing was done. And that is egregious conduct,” Susser said.A spokesperson for the Boynton Beach Police Department said the city will respond through legal channels. Cesar, who is charged with first-degree murder, is still awaiting trial.

By: Matt Sczesny Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Economic concerns dominated voters' minds in Tuesday's elections, leading to Democratic victories in New York City, New Jersey, Virginia and California as the party pledges to address affordability issues.When Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayor's race, he largely did it by focusing on an issue that stretches from red states to blue states: the cost of living.WATCH BELOW: New York City to Florida, affordability remains the top issue Affordability remains top issue in red & blue states ""This is essentially the same issue that got Donald Trump elected president, it's inflation, it's lack of affordability,"" said Dave Aronberg, a former Florida state senator and former Palm Beach County State Attorney. ""Essentially the same message that prices are too damn high.""As New York City wrestles with affordability issues, the same can be said for Florida, where a recent FAU poll showed about 50% of residents have considered moving because of the cost of living, with insurance, property taxes and inflation among the top factors.""Affordability issues are broader and harder to tackle for any one politician,"" Aronberg said. ""It's not like you can push a button or turn a switch and then things are less expensive.""In Florida, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have targeted affordability as a top issue.Democrats are proposing several bills to reduce the cost of homeowners insurance, while Republicans are taking aim at reducing property taxes.""My job is to find some way to put money back in the pocket of Floridians,"" state Rep.

By: Kayla McDermott Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — The federal government shutdown has entered its 36th day, officially becoming the longest shutdown in U.S. history as Republicans and Democrats remain locked in a standoff over health care with neither party willing to budge.President Donald Trump summoned Senate Republicans to the White House this morning, where he blamed the shutdown for Tuesday's election results and urged lawmakers to eliminate the filibuster. Doing so would allow Republicans to pass bills with a simple majority without Democratic support. Government shutdown reaches historic 36 days as TSA workers struggle without pay ""If you don't terminate the filibuster, you'll be in bad shape. We won't pass any legislation. There'll be no legislation passed,"" Trump said.While some signs on Capitol Hill suggest negotiators could be making progress, with lawmakers expressing cautious optimism that a deal could be reached by the end of the week, Democrats claim it all depends on the White House.Meanwhile, TSA workers who are no longer being paid are speaking out about the mounting challenges they face. These federal employees continue working despite being cut off from paychecks and some benefits, with many unsure how much longer they can last.""Everybody is hurting from this,"" said William Watts, a TSA officer and veteran who is manning the front lines. ""I shouldn't be treated this way working for the federal government."" Travel TSA workers face paycheck uncertainty as shutdown continues Kayla McDermott Watts described the difficult conditions workers face daily. ""We're expected to come in each day with a smile on our face under the tumultuous stress of the general public,"" Watts said. ""There's no relief, there's no aid.""Mickey Alston, a representative with AFGE Local 558, a federal union representing seven airports in the area, has been receiving daily calls from federal workers begging for help. ""I myself just had a medical procedure done yesterday and I had to beg just to try and get a deferment,"" Alston said. ""We can't buy medication because we don't have a check. That is very demoralizing.""Alston noted the urgency of housing situations for affected workers as some workers won't even have a place to live soon. ""Some rental places only give you a week tops to actually pay rent and mortgages,"" Alston said.

Finlay said.Finlay has witnessed shortages in air traffic control and TSA staffing, and expressed concern about potential disruptions as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warns of potential mass chaos in the skies. ""It is very scary for the traveling public,"" Finlay said. For Watts, his motivation to keep coming to work remains his family, despite the financial hardship.

"Park rangers could soon patrol these parks as city approves $500K safety program","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyLake Worth Beach Park rangers could soon patrol Lake Worth Beach parks as city approves $500K safety program WPTV's Vannia Joseph speaks to residents and city leaders about the plan that would create a new Park Ranger Division within the city's Leisure Services Department WPTV By: Vannia Joseph Posted and last updated LAKE WORTH BEACH, Fla. — Park rangers could soon be a regular sight at some of Lake Worth Beach's most popular public spaces.City leaders just approved a $500,000 Park Ranger Program aimed at keeping local parks clean, safe, and family-friendly. The plan, approved at Tuesday night's city commission meeting, would create a new Park Ranger Division within the city's Leisure Services Department.WATCH BELOW: 'We really want to embed them with the community,' Leisure Services Director Stuart Sword Park rangers could soon patrol these parks as city approves $500K safety program At Bryant Park, a father and son duo were having lunch at a bench when they learned about the city's latest move.""Quite frankly, I think the park seems pretty safe right now,"" said parkgoer Chase Patterson.While Patterson said he generally feels comfortable at the city's parks, leaders said the new initiative is meant to further enhance that sense of safety for families and visitors who frequent the city's green spaces.""$500,000 is a lot of money for the city of Lake Worth,"" said Elam Patterson.Of that half-million dollars, about $352,146 will go toward wages and benefits, and another $66,000 for other expenses including mountain bikes, uniforms, certifications, and marketing materials. That leaves more than $80,000 in reserve as the city evaluates the program's first phase. Lake Worth Beach City spending nearly $100K on upgrades to public park restrooms Vannia Joseph Stuart Sword, the city's director of Leisure Services, said the idea has been months in the making. He describes it as a ""cold start program"" — the first of its kind for Lake Worth Beach.""So, the park rangers will initially be at the beachfront, in Bryant Park, in Sunset Ridge, and Howard Park,"" Sword said. ""Those parks are cumulatively about 30 acres of green space."" Sword said those four parks will act as a focus group to gauge the success of the program before expanding to others.""Their footprint is not just limited to those four parks, they could go to the other 32 open green spaces throughout Lake Worth Beach,"" said Sword.While Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office deputies will continue overnight patrols under the city's $15 million contract, the park rangers' duties will differ.WATCH: Mayor proposed making people pay to use park bathrooms Lake Worth Beach to tackle vandalism at public park restrooms ""A park ranger is not a law enforcement officer. They are not certified under the criminal system, so when they approach a citizen and they're not in line with a city ordinance, they will issue a warning,"" Sword explained. ""They will have the ability to issue citations if the situation warrants that citation being issued, they will not have arresting authorities but they will go through F.A.C.E training, that stands for Florida Association of Code Enforcement, once they go through that training, they will be they will be certified to enforce city ordinances. A lot of those city ordinances do pertain to our parks, beach front, and our recreation facilities."" City commissioners said the move comes after complaints from residents who said they've felt unsafe in certain areas, particularly Bryant Park, where issues with homelessness and vandalism have been ongoing. Months earlier, WPTV reported that the city spent nearly $100,000 on restroom upgrades to prevent repeated damage. Those improvements included concrete sinks, sturdier dividers, and tile that's harder to damage and easier to clean.Sword said the Park Ranger program will roll out in phases beginning with recruitment, training, and community outreach before rangers hit the parks. The program would start with one manager, three full-time rangers, and two part-time rangers, they'd focus on education, enforcement, and community outreach, using bike patrols to stay visible and approachable.""Ideally, in the next 120 days, you will see a uniformed park ranger in one of the four parks I mentioned,"" Sword said.

"Trump lands in Miami to speak about his economic agenda","NewsTrump Trump lands in Miami to speak about his economic agenda on the anniversary of his election win Patrick Semansky/AP FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2020, file photo President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington before boarding Marine One. Unemployment benefits for millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet were set to lapse at midnight Saturday night unless Trump signed an end-of-year COVID relief and spending bill that had been considered a done deal before his sudden objections. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) By: Seung Min Kim, Associated Press Posted MIAMI — President Donald Trump is in Miami on Wednesday — the anniversary of his reelection to a second term — to speak to a forum of business leaders and global athletes about what he sees as his economic achievements.He began his remarks by proclaiming his love for the city of Miami and bragging about his electoral success one year ago, as well as the state of the economy.""We have the greatest economy right now. A lot of people don't see that,"" Trump said.The Republican president's speech to the America Business Forum will be a broad look at his economic agenda and how investments he has secured abroad help U.S. communities, according to a senior White House official. It's a significant effort from Trump to put a positive spin on the economy at a time when Americans remain uneasy about the state of their finances and the cost of living — and when major campaigns in Tuesday's elections were centered on affordability and the economy.The AP Voter Poll survey, which included more than 17,000 voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City, suggested the public was troubled by higher prices and fewer job opportunities despite Trump's promises to tame inflation and unleash growth. Republicans handily lost key races in Virginia and New Jersey, and the president acknowledged Wednesday that the ongoing government shutdown, whose effects have rippled throughout the economy and forced government workers to go without paychecks, was ""negative for the Republicans.""In his speech, Trump will touch on deregulation, energy independence and oil prices, and affordability, said the White House official, who insisted on anonymity to preview the president's address.Trump spent five days in Asia last week with stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. He worked to ease trade tensions with Beijing in a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In Tokyo, he promoted several major energy and tech projects for the U.S. that will be funded by Japan.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said he thinks Trump's recent travels ""have been transformational in his presidency"" and said his speech will be a highlight of the forum, which organizers have described as a more accessible version of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or the Milken Institute Global Conference, which gathers the world's elite for discussions on the economy.Political leaders, business executives and athletes including tennis legend Serena Williams and soccer star Lionel Messi are among the speakers at the forum inside Kaseya Center, the home of the Miami Heat that been has transformed with an elaborate, futuristic stage where speakers are introduced with a light display and machines shooting smoke into the air. It's primarily sponsored by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, which is a key pillar of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to pursue megaprojects and investments abroad.""This conference not only is creating this incredible collection of people, but it's also creating them in a particular moment in time,"" said Suarez, a Republican.Earlier Wednesday, the conference hosted María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader and winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize who praised the U.S. president's posture toward Venezuela in her remarks.""Regarding the strategy of President Trump toward this criminal narco-terrorist structure, it's absolutely correct because Nicolás Maduro is not a legitimate head of state,"" said Machado, who appeared at the forum remotely.Trump's visit also highlights how the Miami area is playing a key role during his second term.Trump is set to host leaders of the world's leading rich and developing economies at next year's Group of 20 summit at his golf club at the nearby city of Doral, despite what critics say is the appearance of impropriety.Trump's sons have taken over running the Trump Organization while their father is in the White House, and the president has insisted that his family's business will not make any money by holding the summit at the golf club.The city is where Trump wants to locate his future presidential library, which is now facing a legal challenge over whether the plot of land in downtown Miami is being properly transferred. Miami is also one of the U.S. host cities for next year's World Cup, which Trump has eagerly promoted as the kickoff to several major global sporting events for which the U.S. is playing host. Ensuring the success of the World Cup has been a top priority for the Trump administration.FIFA President Gianni Infantino, with whom Trump has developed a close friendship, is scheduled to speak at the Miami forum later Wednesday.

The incident happened at about 2:48 a.m. in the parking lot of Harpers Pub, located at 1774 Southeast Port St. Lucie Blvd.WATCH BELOW: Argument about chickens leads to 3 arrests after shots fired outside pub Shooting outside Port St. Lucie pub stemmed from chickens & eggs, police Police said a preliminary investigation revealed that a disturbance occurred in the parking lot after the pub closed. During the disturbance, police said Peter Riera, 44, of Port St. Lucie, brandished a Glock 30 handgun and fired four shots at three different victims — 2 men and one woman in their 20s — as they ran through the parking lot. No one was struck by the gunfire. Investigators said the three victims knew each other and had just met Riera that night. According to the police, they were all drinking together inside the pub and were all intoxicated to varying degrees. They tell us Riera and the three victims then got into an argument over chickens. ""There was a conversation about how many, I kid you not, how many eggs a chicken can lay. And that conversation got a little heated, and as it went out into the parking lot, the conversation continued, and the shooter became agitated, became paranoid,"" said Sgt. Dominick Mesiti. Once they were all outside the pub, police said Riera apparently ""became paranoid and agitated"" as he accused the victims of trying to ""con"" him. But investigators spoke with witnesses who say that claim was unsubstantiated. These allegations escalated the disturbance, resulting in Riera firing his handgun. Surveillance video shows Riera hiding after police say he fired at the three victims. Police announced Wednesday that Riera now faces the following charges: 3 counts of attempted aggravated battery with a deadly weapon2 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon 4 counts of discharging a firearm in public 1 count of use of a firearm while under the influenceDuring the investigation, police said Brandon Pace, 24, of Port St. Lucie, was detained at the scene and arrested after police said he obstructed officers during the investigation and kicked two officers while being detained.

"Fintech firm that boasted it would bring 200 new jobs is shutting down","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach Fintech firm MyBambu shutting down West Palm Beach office, laying off all employees The company sent WPTV a written statement calling the letter 'precautionary’ because it’s working on raising money to keep the office open WPTV By: Ethan Stein , Audra Schroeder Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A West Palm Beach fintech firm that boasted it would bring 200 new jobs to the area is already shutting down operations. MyBambu, a financial services company that moved its base of operations from Memphis to West Palm Beach in 2021, moved into a new 35,000-square-foot office space on Dixie Highway over the summer — marking one of the largest leases in the city of West Palm Beach. WPTV was at that July event featuring city and county leaders, when CEO Douglas Quay remarked, ""We are getting ready to grow significantly."" WATCH: MyBambu closing West Palm Beach office Fintech firm that boasted it would bring 200 new jobs is shutting down Just three months later, the company is laying off all 141 employees and ceasing operations by the end of December, according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) notice sent to the Florida Department of Commerce. The company states in the notice that this decision was made ""after unexpectedly learning that the main and historical source of funding for MyBambu's operations would end, depriving MyBambu of funding necessary for running its operations and necessitating the commencement of an orderly wind-down."" A spokesperson for the company declined to answer WPTV’s questions about the letter. However, MyBambu sent us a written statement calling the letter “precautionary"" because it’s working on raising money to keep the office open.Multiple employees, who talked to WPTV off camera, said they are nervous and frustrated about the closure after recently changing offices. The letter said the first wave of layoffs, 100 employees, was expected on Oct. 31. The other 41 employees would likely lose their jobs by Dec. 31.

She also said she was confident employees laid off would find new jobs because of the area’s unemployment rate.
