"Why human trafficking operations are surfacing in PBC neighborhoods","NewsPalm Beach County Why human trafficking operations are surfacing in Palm Beach County neighborhoods Data from the Human Trafficking Hotline shows residence-based commercial sex was among the most common venues for trafficking in Florida, with 58 cases reported last year WPTV Human trafficking advocates say traffickers often target neighborhoods to avoid detection. By: Zitlali Solache Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — We’re digging deeper into the multiple human trafficking and prostitution rings in Palm Beach County.Officials with the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office told WPTV, they caught 31-year-old Cinthia Saucedo Torres after she fled to Mexico and tried to re-enter at the U.S. border.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Why human trafficking operations are surfacing in Palm Beach County neighborhoods We first told you about the investigation on Tuesday, after Torres was arrested, and faces multiple felonies, accused of running and profiting from brothels in Lake Worth and West Palm Beach through threats and violence.Our coverage sparked a wave of reaction on TikTok, with viewers expressing shock over the neighborhoods where the operations were active.Laura Cusack, with the Human Trafficking Coalition of the Palm Beaches, explains traffickers often target neighborhoods to avoid detection.“You go to a hotel; you’re somewhere out in the public — there’s staff. There’s security. There’s front desk staff. There might be managers and housekeeping. There's lots of eyes that can pay attention to what’s going on,” said Cusack. “But if you’re in a neighborhood, it allows them to go under the radar, in the sense that there isn’t staff monitoring.”According to the arrest report, a victim told investigators she met a man at a restaurant who offered her money for a massage. When she arrived, she found herself in a brothel and was pressured to perform sexual acts. She says she felt forced to stay for money, and when she tried to leave, she was threatened with a gun.“The really unfortunate aspect or recruitment tactic that these traffickers will use is they will look for individuals who maybe need something, who are desperate, who are down their luck, who need a job, who want to provide for their families,” said Cusack.Data from the Human Trafficking Hotline shows residence-based commercial sex was among the most common venues for trafficking in Florida, with 58 cases reported last year.Cusack applauds law enforcement, but said it will take more effort from people to fight the crisis.“They do a great job in investigating and following up, but it really takes the community to be the ones to tip them off or give them the information or see something and report it,’ said Cusack.As of Wednesday, court records don’t show pending charges against Torres’ brother or husband, and it's still unclear how many victims were involved.If you would like to report a trafficking situation, call the National Human Trafficking Hotline toll-free hotline at 1-888-373-7888.","https://www.wptv.com/news/palm-beach-county/why-human-trafficking-operations-are-surfacing-in-palm-beach-county-neighborhoods"

LUCIE, Fla. — If you’ve driven down St. Lucie West Boulevard during rush hour, you’ve likely seen the line of cars that backs up into the intersection when drivers don't make the green light.Now, the Port St. Lucie Police Department is cracking down on drivers who ""block the box,” the area within an intersection that should remain clear.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: ‘Don’t block the box’: Port St. Lucie police target drivers blocking intersections Rush-hour traffic is already slow-moving, but when vehicles stop in the middle of intersections, it creates gridlock and delays for everyone on the road.“Everybody’s in a hurry depending on what your day is like and people want to get to their destination so they’re going to blow every light that they can,” said Port St. Lucie resident Darlene Mahler.Police say that by trying to squeeze past the intersection and tailgate the car in front of them, drivers are actually disrupting the flow of cross traffic.“People are so self-centered that they’re just so worried about themselves and don’t really consider anybody else and it just makes it harder for everyone,” said commuter Cyrus Postis.To address the issue, Port St. Lucie police are increasing enforcement along busy stretches of St. Lucie West Boulevard. Their message: “don’t block the box!”“It’s just something that needs to be done, [so] that people realize, you know what, you’re not the only one in line,” Mahler said.Photos posted on the department’s Facebook page show long lines of vehicles stopped in the middle of intersections.The problem doesn’t just affect drivers, but also pedestrians. “A lot of people stop in the crosswalk,” said resident Tom Murphins, who relies on his scooter to get around. He’s even installed an air horn to alert drivers blocking his path.Police say they’ll begin the campaign with education before issuing tickets at intersections known for congestion, including Peacock, Cashmere, and California boulevards.“I just came from there and it was just like that, there was a traffic trailer going westbound that blocked the whole thing,” Murphins said.Both drivers and pedestrians hope the crackdown will help traffic move more smoothly and safely through one of the city’s busiest corridors.Portions of this story were assisted by artificial intelligence tools and reviewed by a WPTV journalists to ensure accuracy, clarity, and adherence to editorial standards.","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/dont-block-the-box-port-st-lucie-police-target-drivers-blocking-intersections"

"2nd lawsuit seeks to stop this government redevelopment project","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoca Raton Resident files lawsuit to halt government campus redevelopment project WPTV's Ange Toussaint is digging into the lawsuit filed by Lorraine Blank who claims that the city failed to comply with state laws and did not conduct an independent analysis for the project WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted and last updated The Boca Raton Government Campus Redevelopment Project is facing another hurdle as a Boca Raton resident asks a district judge to stop the project from moving forward.WATCH BELOW: 'We should really put all the time and take local opinions into consideration,' Joli Thompson tells WPTV 2nd lawsuit seeks to stop this government redevelopment project According to the lawsuit filed by resident Lorraine Blank, she argues that the city failed to comply with state laws and did not conduct an independent cost-effectiveness analysis for the project.The lawsuit also raises concerns that the redevelopment could lead to “the privatization of historically public property” and the “reallocation of civic infrastructure toward commercial uses.” It claims the city has discussed selling some residential units, which could permanently deny other residents access to certain areas.In the filing, Blank said the “absence of a proper cost-effectiveness analysis is particularly concerning given the project’s scale and the disparity in developed square footage dedicated to private interests,” suggesting the proposal primarily benefits private developers rather than serving a public purpose as required under Florida’s public-private partnership laws.WATCH BELOW: Third version of Boca Raton downtown campus project revealed Third version of Boca Raton downtown campus project revealed, residents weigh in It’s the latest pushback against the proposed Boca redevelopment campus — and the second lawsuit filed against the city.The project by Miami-based Terra Frisbie Group would transform 30 acres of publicly owned land into a mixed-use development. The plan includes a new government campus, community center, and residential units. Despite several revisions from developers and public meetings, the proposal has been met with widespread criticism and petitions from the Save Boca group.Boca Raton resident Joli Thompson also questions why the city continues to move forward with the project.“I think if we’re gonna put this much time and money and resources into something this vast and large, we should really put all the time and take local opinions into consideration before doing something like this,” Thompson said. “I’ve lived here my whole life, and I don’t think we need anything crazy or any changes.""WATCH BELOW: Boca Raton resident wants injunction to stop Save Boca ballot measure Resident wants injunction to stop Save Boca ballot measure In October, the city filed a motion to have the lawsuit dismissed, but the case continues. In a statement, city officials said the claims are inaccurate and that a cost-effectiveness analysis is being conducted. The city said it engaged PFM Group Consulting to perform the analysis and plans to complete it before entering a final binding contract.The city said the analysis remains in draft form, because developers Terra Frisbie with the One Boca project paused it in response to feedback that eliminated private development within Memorial Park.The case is scheduled to be heard in December, and a ballot measure over the city’s sale and lease of public land is scheduled for March.READ FULL LAWSUIT BELOW:","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boca-raton/resident-files-lawsuit-to-halt-government-campus-redevelopment-project"

'This is a self-inflicted wound, and it's not going away,' says former Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg WPTV By: Dave Bohman Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — The friendship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump frayed in 2004, four years before Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution. But in a 2011 email from Epstein to his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein writes Trump ""spent hours at my house"" on Palm Beach with one of Epstein's victims and that encounter ""has never once been mentioned"" by police. House Democrats release emails from Jeffrey Epstein ""There's no smoking gun that indicates that President Trump was involved in any criminal activity,"" said former Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg.Aronberg has followed the Epstein case closely and read some of the Epstein emails. One was in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, who once had access to the president. Epstein wrote of Trump, ""Of course he knew about the girls."" ""Where this hurts is in the court of public opinion amongst his base,"" Aronberg said.""This is a self-inflicted wound, and it's not going away. This could all be overcome by releasing all the Epstein files. Say to the public that yes, you were friends with Epstein, but that ended.""Epstein died by suicide while in jail in 2019.

Melanie Stansbury, D-New Mexico.The White House is fighting back.""These emails prove absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong, and what President Trump has always said is that he was from Palm Beach and so was Jeffrey Epstein,"" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.

It’s open 24/7 and it’s open to anyone.WPTV reporter Victor Jorges spent the morning with Palm Beach Harvest CEO Deborah Morgan.She told him about their efforts to bring food directly to those who need it. Because they don’t have a brick-and-mortar location, it allows them to be wherever the need is, she said.Morgan explained that Palm Beach Harvest has been around for nearly three decades and their focus helping in more than one way.“Sixty percent of food is consumed, 40% is thrown away,” she said. ""We’re that 40%, we capture that. That’s what makes us completely different from other food banks. We rescue that food that would otherwise end up in our landfills, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with the food.”They’ve also recently partnered with Goodwill Industries to provide meal packets, perfect for kids and older adults. It’s easy to use, just add hot water to the mixture and it’ll turn into an oatmeal or vegetable soup.“Everyone loves it,” she said. “And it’s easy to prepare.”Jorges asked Morgan what the best way for the community to help the organization was. She said they appreciate everything they receive, but they’re always looking for financial donations, so they can pay for gas and their trucks. Drivers volunteer their time and the food they give out is donated, so transportation is their main cost.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/palm-beach-harvest-providing-free-food-to-those-who-need-it-most"
