To have a chance to receive mentorship from premier coaches,” said Stuart Sword, the assistant director of assisted services in Lake Worth Beach.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's Kendall Hyde speaks with kids competing in the event Lake Worth Beach kids take the field for MLB’s Pitch, Hit & Run competition As the name suggests, the competition focuses on pitching, hitting, and running drills and gives kids a chance to sharpen their skills and advance through multiple rounds, with the grand prize being a trip to the World Series.Each kid says that every event brought different challenges.10-year-old Kolton Curtis finished first in his age group, calling the pitching portion the toughest but most rewarding.“Pitching because it was so small, and it was really hard — it was a good competition,” Curtis said. He’s now focused on advancing, with dreams of watching Major League players up close. “It’s really cool, they throw the ball hard, and they hit it like 400 feet.”Other standouts included Ethan Cabrera, who said he enjoyed “the pitching, the hitting, and the running,” and Victor Marshall, who placed second in his age group. “I’m not that surprised, but I’m surprised — because that’s how I usually hit,” Marshall said.But for some, the event was less about winning and more about community. Ricardo Sanchez-Berio summed it up by saying, “If I lose, I lose; it really doesn’t matter. If you lose, it’s just about having fun, and the point of baseball is to have fun, friendship, and get better.” ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/sports/local-sports/lake-worth-beach-kids-take-the-field-for-mlbs-pitch-hit-run-competition"

The event brought together Keep Palm Beach County Beautiful, the Sheriff's Office and families from nearby schools near Benny's on the Beach.The event marks the 40th International Coastal Clean-up and volunteers say they're seeing different types of trash than they did decades ago, highlighting evolving environmental challenges.WPTV's Victor Jorges spoke to organizers about what’s next after volunteers put in the work.""We've picked up hundreds of pounds of trash,"" said Linda Moreno, executive director for Keep Palm Beach County Beautiful.The organization weighs and catalogs all collected debris, sending the data to the Ocean Conservancy to contribute to global pollution tracking efforts.After four decades of participation, organizers have noticed significant changes in both participation and the types of pollution they encounter. More families are now attending the events as a way to spend time together while contributing to environmental protection.The composition of beach litter has also evolved over the years. Volunteers are finding fewer cigarette butts scattered across the sand, suggesting possible changes in smoking habits or disposal practices. However, they're encountering a new challenge: microplastics.These tiny plastic fragments are becoming increasingly common but present a greater removal challenge due to their small size, making cleanup efforts more complex than in previous decades.More information about Keep Palm Beach County Beautiful's volunteer opportunities are available here:https://www.keeppbcbeautiful.org/monthly-volunteer-opportunities.html ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/region-c-palm-beach-county/lake-worth-beach/lake-worth-beach-cleanup-highlights-shifting-pollution-trends-after-40-years"
"CDC drops universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendation. What it means for Florida","NewsYour Health Matters CDC panel drops universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendation. What it means for Florida Panel voted to remove all universal recommendations for this fall’s COVID shot, instead leaving the decision up to individuals. WPTV By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory panel issued new COVID-19 vaccine guidelines Friday — and the decision could affect millions of Floridians.The panel voted to remove all universal recommendations for this fall’s COVID shot, instead leaving the decision up to individuals. They also voted to remove prescription requirements, meaning patients won’t need a doctor’s note to get vaccinated. WATCH: CDC leaves decision to get vaccine up to individuals CDC drops universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendation. What it means for Florida But the changes are already raising concerns about access and cost.Dr. Michael Haller, a pediatric endocrinologist, says with no CDC recommendation in place, insurance companies may decide not to cover the vaccine — even for people who want it.“It may result in fewer insurers being willing to pay for vaccinations, even for those who do want it,” Haller told WPTV’s Michael Hoffman. “So the notion that anybody will be able to get it if they want it may not actually be correct.” Haller says one positive step is that the CDC panel eliminated the prescription requirement.WATCH: Resident compares search for COVID shot to scavenger hunt COVID vaccine restrictions leave residents scrambling for boosters “That’s at least a move in the right direction,” he said, adding that requiring prescriptions has been “an unnecessary burden” that discouraged people from getting vaccinated.“I have colleagues who were unable to get vaccinated, who actually are over 65 because they didn't walk into a major pharmacy with a prescription in hand, and had to be turned away, only to come back later with one so that they could then be given the vaccine,” said Haller. “So, you know, every little thing like that that happens is going to have an exponential effect on the number of people who aren't vaccinated, and therefore going to increase the spread.”The updated guidance will not take effect until the CDC’s acting director signs off — and it’s not clear when that might happen.Once finalized, CVS has already said it will allow patients in Florida to book appointments online or walk in for the shot, according to NBC News.And while the CDC may no longer recommend the vaccine, other medical organizations say they will continue to do so. WPTV Investigates 'It's a mess!' New rules cause confusion over COVID vaccine in Florida Katie LaGrone “The American Academy of Pediatrics will continue to provide its own vaccine recommendations,” Haller said. He stressed the importance of remembering the virus has, like the flu, not totally gone away.“People think COVID is gone, but it is not. We’re in the middle of another COVID wave, and there are people dying of COVID every day. The number of those deaths could be reduced if people were appropriately and adequately vaccinated.” ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/health/cdc-panel-drops-universal-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation-what-it-means-for-florida"
