Mitchell Elementary School.Neighbors who live nearby the school said they’re already noticing safer driving. More than 200 drivers ticketed in first week of Boca school zone speed cameras “I think people are starting to become more aware,” said resident Jonathan Shair.We first told you about the speed zone cameras back in July. Last week, parents weighed in on the cameras, and they’re already seeing safer driving.Drivers going 10 miles over the speed limit in active school zones will be cited $100. For Shair, that lesson hit when he got a warning in the mail.“Because of this [warning], I will make sure that I try to be more careful when I’m on that road for sure,” said Shair.Thousands of drivers like Shair were given these warnings during the test period last month. He believes the system is working.“I just hope that they’ll put in more cameras along all these schools so we can really make the city a safe place to live,” said Shair.We learned where the revenue is distributed:$60 stays with the city or county to help run the camera program and fund other public safety initiatives.$20 goes to the General Revenue Fund.$12 goes to the local school district for safety improvements, transportation, or security — funds that must also be shared with charter schools.$5 supports the School Crossing Guard Recruitment and Retention Program.$3 goes to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for training.

""My neighbor did the right thing, and the outcome was not the right thing.This incident isn’t isolated; similar pranks across the country have resulted in tragic outcomes, including injuries and fatalities when well-meaning residents mistake pranksters for intruders. National News 11-year-old fatally shot in Houston after 'ding dong ditch' prank, police say AP via Scripps News Group ""It’s a very, very dangerous game they were playing. Luckily no one was killed. This could have gone in a very different direction,"" said criminal defense attorney Michelle Suskauer, who is not involved in this case.She emphasizes that self-defense and stand your ground laws have their limits.“The question in this particular case is what did this person reasonably believe or did they reasonably fear that their home was going to be broken into?” she posed.She expects a lot more usage of firearms in Florida with open carry and anticipates more arrests from people misusing firearms.""You have a right to protect yourself; you have a right to protect your property. Every case is different, and we have to look at the interactions between the two and figure out if the use of his firearm is reasonable,"" said Suskauer. ""It's a good message to firearm owners that every use of their firearm is not necessarily protected.""Cairo's next court appearance is scheduled for next month. Hall hopes for a fair outcome.“I hope the outcome is that that young man learns a very serious lesson and that my neighbor Santiago, his name is cleared,” she said.

LUCIE, Fla. — Port St. Lucie residents have long asked for more entertainment options close to home. Now, city leaders say their answering the call with a new public-private partnership that will bring dining, nightlife and family-friendly spaces to the heart of the city.WATCH BELOW: 'Can’t wait to see it come to fruition,' Lillian Soto tells WPTV This new addition will soon bring restaurants and family fun to Port St. Lucie By early next year, the vacant lot next to Pioneer Park in The Port District is expected to be transformed into The Grove, an entertainment hub that will feature seven venues offering everything from rooftop dining to casual eateries.“We’re excited about it! Can’t wait to see it come to fruition,” said resident Lillian Soto.The project marks the latest milestone in Port St. Lucie’s ongoing surge of growth and development. Community leaders broke ground on The Grove less than two weeks after announcing plans for a soccer stadium nearby.“I have seen Port St. Lucie change quite a bit. It is becoming more geared towards families which is nicer because there really wasn’t a lot for young families to do in the area,” said resident Shantel Luke.Developed by SŪDĀ Investments, the $15 million project is expected to create more than 200 jobs and attract an estimated 400,000 visitors annually.“Bringing that economic impact—bringing those dollars right here into Port St. Lucie is really great for our local economy,” said Mayor Shannon Martin.WATCH BELOW: Port St. Lucie awarded professional soccer team Port St. Lucie awarded professional soccer team Many residents said a space like this has been long overdue.“We travel outside of Port St. Lucie to go find fun things to do so this will keep money down here, revenue down here, and keep us down here too,” said resident Jonathan Loyd.“It’s nice, especially living down here directly in this community for my kids to be able to come here and play, for us to do date nights or walk down here, the boys to come fishing,” Luke added.While excitement grows, some residents expressed concern about potential parking and traffic issues once the district opens.“The parking lot right now is already full,” said Gemini Soto. “There’s zero, zero parking at all—where are we going to put those people?”Martin said the city has planned ahead to address those concerns.“Everything has been set and planned according to all of our planning standards, according to all the traffic analyses and it’s not like we’re going to have swarms of hundreds and hundreds or thousands of people at a time,” she said.For now, residents are eagerly awaiting the arrival of what city officials hope will become a destination for locals and visitors alike, offering a vibrant new space for dining, entertainment and community connection.

"This mayor could be the next Palm Beach County Attorney","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWellington Wellington Mayor Michael Napoleone on short list to become next Palm Beach County Attorney WPTV reaches out to the village to ask if Napoleone would have to step down as mayor Village of Wellington Wellington Mayor Michael J. Napoleone By: Michael Hoffman , Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WELLINGTON, Fla. — WPTV learned Thursday night that Wellington Village Mayor Michael Napoleone is on the short list to become the next Palm Beach County Attorney.His consideration to leaving the position, after voters gave him more than 80% of the vote last March, hasn’t been previously reported until Thursday. We started pushing for answers after we learned Napoleone applied to become a county attorney and is being interviewed for the job. Wellington Mayor Michael Napoleone on short list for Palm Beach County Attorney role Napoleone confirmed to WPTV with a statement saying, ""I'm honored to be on the final interview list. Right now, I'm letting the process play out. I'm focusing on the jobs I have now and will make a decision as to everything else after the Commission makes their decision.""In the state of Florida, it is illegal for an individual to hold two government offices at the same time.WPTV reporter Michael Hoffman reached out to the Village of Wellington to ask if Napoleone would have to step down as mayor if he takes on the new job with the county.In a statement provided to Hoffman, the Village attorney said in part:""There is nothing in Wellington’s Charter or Code of Ordinances that would require the Mayor to resign from his position if he is selected to be the County Attorney. In addition, in AGO 73-337, the Florida Attorney General opined that an elected school board member’s employment as a part-time County Attorney would not constitute dual office holding under Florida’s Constitution…” “ We do not know whether any County policy would require him to resign. Whether he continued in office or not would likely be part of his negotiations with the County. If he did remain as Mayor while also serving as the County Attorney, he would have to be careful to avoid any matters involving the County and Wellington.""Searching for answers, Hoffman spoke with attorney and former Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg. He said that while he would likely be allowed to hold both positions, there would have to be precautions taken.""There's not an automatic conflict of interest here,"" Aronberg said. ""Obviously, if something comes before the County Commission and the attorney's desk that has something to do with the Village of Wellington, or anything to do with himself, personally, he would have to recuse himself, but a blanket conflict, no.""The village also told Hoffman that if Napoleone does step down, it would likely require the municipality to have a special election to fill the mayor's seat since two council seats are up for election as well.No decision has been made by the county commission at this time.Napoleone was elected to the mayor's seat in 2024, serving a term intended to go through 2028. The Boca Raton native joined the Village Council in 2015, serving as the first non-sitting council member elected without opposition in the Village's history. He also served as vice mayor from April 2019 to April 2020 and was re-appointed to the position in April 2023.The current county attorney, Denise Coffman, is retiring in December, according to multiple sources.

"Elderly couple faces homelessness after fire destroys longtime home","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoynton Beach Elderly couple faces homelessness after fire destroys longtime home James and Mammie Wright have lived in their Boynton Beach home since 1974 WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — A Boynton Beach couple, who spent five decades in the same home, say they are now facing homelessness after a fire tore through their house earlier this year.James and Mammie Wright have lived in their Boynton Beach home since 1974. But on April 27, a fire swept through the property, leaving behind heavy smoke damage, a collapsed roof, and a lifetime of memories reduced to ashes.“I was in the bathroom washing up and I smelled smoke,” said Mammie Wright. “I told my husband I smell something burning. I’m standing there and seeing the smoke go around my utility door.” WPTV Within hours, the couple’s home was unlivable. The Boynton Beach Fire Department said the cause of the fire remains undetermined, but inspectors declared the structure uninhabitable.WPTV visited the home of the couple after speaking with them at our Let’s Hear It event held in Boynton Beach on Wednesday. When we arrived, the Wrights walked through what used to be their living room and kitchen, now dark, moldy spaces. Old photos, church suits, and other personal belongings remain scattered throughout the home.“This used to be the living room,” Wright said softly. “I took all my pictures off the wall.”The couple said they had paid off their mortgage early, hoping to live out their retirement years in peace. But they did not have homeowners insurance, and their fixed Social Security income isn’t enough to rebuild.They attempted to sell the damaged home to an investor, but the deal recently fell through when the buyer reduced the offer.Since the fire, the Wrights have been living with friends and in motels for months. They say the emotional and financial strain has been overwhelming.“It was really, really hard,” Mammie said. “A lot of times I couldn’t sleep at night. I’d wake up hoping something would change, but it didn’t,” added James.The Area Agency on Aging of Palm Beach and Treasure Coast says situations like the Wrights’ are becoming more common as housing costs rise and elderly residents struggle on fixed incomes.“It happens more frequently than you would expect,” said Dwight Chenette, executive director of the agency. “We receive many calls for housing assistance, it’s one of the top reasons people reach out.The agency told WPTV they are working to connect the Wrights with local programs that can provide legal aid and housing support.“We have specially trained representatives who are familiar with the resources available for seniors,” Chenette said.The Wrights say they’re hopeful help will come soon.Residents in need of elderly housing or legal assistance can contact the Area Agency on Aging at 866-684-5885.

As the impasse continues, Americans who are already struggling financially face mounting concerns, particularly those who rely on SNAP benefits for food assistance.WATCH BELOW: 'These are people's lives at stake,' Judith Cruz tells WPTV's Kayla McDermott Shutdown threatens SNAP benefits as food banks brace for crisis Food bank leaders across Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast are sounding alarms about an impending crisis. With at least 400,000 people already food insecure in the region, local organizations are preparing for unprecedented demand.""We are going to go into an emergency crisis here,"" said Jamie Kendall, CEO of the Palm Beach County Food Bank.Judith Cruz, CEO of the Treasure Coast Food Bank, echoed those concerns, noting her organization already serves 250,000 people weekly. ""This is going to double that number,"" Cruz said.The urgency stems from a notice issued by the Florida Department of Children and Families explaining that SNAP benefits will be cut off next month if the government shutdown continues past November 1st. Food bank executives say the timing couldn't be worse, as their organizations are already operating with low supplies.""It's kind of bringing back some COVID memories to be honest with you,"" Kendall said. However, Cruz emphasized this crisis differs significantly from the pandemic response. ""With COVID, we had safety nets, and the government stepped in and took care of the citizens, took care of the communities across the entire country,"" Cruz said. ""With this there is no safety net. We are the only safety net, and our resources are being stretched too thin.""To Cruz, the political standoff is just harming the American people who voted the very leaders into office that are causing the stalemate.WATCH BELOW: Rising grocery prices increases food insecurity Rising grocery prices increasing food insecurity ""We need the help from the federal government.

""We used to buy 15,000 turkeys. I think we purchased maybe 2,500."" Kendall is working with partner organizations to develop contingency plans as the situation deteriorates. ""With our 200 partner agencies that are boots on the ground out there, they're going to be in the front lines of this as well,"" Kendall said. ""So we are working on some plans here of what that might look like, and hoping for the best.""Those partner agencies, like Boca Raton Helping Hands, understand the critical role food assistance plays for vulnerable populations. A representative from the organization, which receives food from the Palm Beach County Food Bank, explained the diverse demographics affected by potential cuts.""It helps them to stretch a budget that otherwise would not be able to allow their families to have quality food,"" the representative said. ""We have to remember these are senior citizens that get it, children, people who are working jobs already, just not making enough money at those jobs."" Among those affected is Kyle Cohen from Lake Worth, who relies on SNAP benefits and Social Security to make ends meet.

That case from 2014 had nearly identical accusations but was dropped because of a lack of evidence.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Investigators uncover third case involving Okeechobee babysitter accused of poisoning children WPTV's Michael Hoffman has been following this case since her arrest, even confronting the suspect as she bonded out of jail.WPTV's Michael Hoffman has uncovered new documents that show a third investigation into the possible poisoning of a baby in the care of Adamo. The incident report from 2023 shows a healthy 2-month-old was picked up from Adamo's Okeechobee home after a day of babysitting. Parents took the baby to a friend's house before going home.They noticed abnormal breathing at the friend’s house, worsening when they got home. Documents showing that the 2-month-old “was a bit lethargic and not acting his normal self.""Parents then noticed it was “as if the baby could not wake up.”They rushed him to the hospital, where staff found “the baby tested positive for opioids” and was airlifted to another hospital. After 2 doses of Narcan, the infant “has made a full recovery.”The investigation brought detectives to test the parents' bottles and formula for opioids, which all came back negative.At the friend’s house, “CSI took many samples and none showed trace amounts of opiates.”When they went to Adamo’s home — investigators “found the house to be very clean,” but documents show “No evidence was collected at the [Adamo’s] residence.”According to documents, investigators “could not discover where the source of the opiate originated from or how the child came into contact with it.”The case was then closed.Hoffman asked the sheriff’s office why Adamo’s house wasn’t tested in 2023, to which they responded the following:“Given recent events in the current [2025] case, the agency has initiated a review of all past cases involving Adamo. Updates will be provided if and when any new information regarding those cases becomes available.”Even with this latest case, investigators say there is a possibility for more investigations to come to light. This is an ongoing investigation. Stay with WPTV for updates.

It will measure 60 feet in diameter and will sit on the west lawn, the same location as Trump's first term in office.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Palm Beach approves larger Mar-a-Lago helipad, neighbors raise concerns ""Will it make noise? Absolutely. These are very big helicopters, and they do make noise,"" said land use attorney Harvey Oyer III. ""They're very heavy, which is why we don’t want to land it on the grass.""Oyer said it will be used for security evacuation rather than daily travel and will be built to support Marine One's weight.During the meeting, member Alexander Ives raised concerns about allowing temporary structures in the town, voting against the request. WPTV has listened to people with concerns about noise, which is nothing new for longtime resident Dave Kaminer.""We have constant helicopters flying up and down the coast,"" said Kaminer.Kaminer, already hearing helicopters at midnight, hopes this won’t add to the noise.""We would hope that Mr. Trump or anybody else using that helicopter is not going to be out here at 2 a.m. waking people from their sleep and that they'll be using it for the benefit of our country,"" said Kaminer.Now, Mar-a-Lago representatives will apply for a building permit.Mar-a-Lago will pay for the helipad, and it will be removed at the end of Trump's presidency.
