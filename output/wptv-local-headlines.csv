"Man arrested after allegedly driving SUV at LGBTQIA+ running club members","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach Man arrested after allegedly driving SUV at LGBTQIA+ running club members in West Palm Beach Ihab Mustafa El Mahmoud faces aggravated assault charges; prosecutors reviewing case for hate crime enhancement WPTV By: Emma Romano Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A 43-year-old man was arrested Monday night after police say he drove a sport-utility vehicle at members of a local LGBTQIA+ running club in West Palm Beach, made multiple attempts to strike them and then fled the scene.The West Palm Beach Police Department responded about 8:20 p.m. to a park along the 1300 block of Parker Avenue after members of the running club reported that a driver in a Ford Bronco accelerated toward the group. Witnesses told officers the driver made a second attempt to hit runners, then drove recklessly across sidewalks, through grass and up an embankment before leaving eastbound on Okeechobee Boulevard, according to the department.Officers issued a lookout for the described vehicle and shortly afterward observed a person matching the suspect's description pull into a parking garage in the 700 block of North Dixie Highway and remove the vehicle's license plate. Police say they took the driver, identified as Ihab Mustafa El Mahmoud, into custody in the garage without incident.Investigators say El Mahmoud became upset after a perceived comment by a male member of the running club, which led to his agitation and the alleged actions. The department has charged El Mahmoud with two counts of aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony and one count of reckless driving. Prosecutors are reviewing the case for possible enhancement under Florida's hate crime statute.The West Palm Beach Police Department provided the information in a statement on the incident. It did not immediately release further details about injuries or the status of the investigation. The case remains under investigation and charges are pending.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

"La Quinta homeless housing plan collapses, county searching for alternatives","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach La Quinta homeless housing plan collapses, leaving Palm Beach County searching for alternatives WPTV's Khalil McLean By: Michael Hoffman Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A plan to turn a La Quinta Inn on Okeechobee Boulevard into housing for seniors and veterans at risk of homelessness has officially collapsed — and many in the community are demanding answers.Last week, WPTV reported that the $16.8 million proposal to purchase the 114-room hotel had fallen through. After viewers reached out with questions, WPTV’s Michael Hoffman returned to the property to learn what happened and what’s next.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: La Quinta homeless housing plan collapses, leaving Palm Beach County searching for alternatives For people living on the streets, the news is devastating.“It sucks,” said Richard Lundsford, who has been without stable housing.Dennis Thomas, who has experienced homelessness since 2008, said the need for help is urgent.“There’s no place for the homeless out here — at all,” Thomas said. “The longer you are out here — it’s like you lose touch with your sanity.”Palm Beach County commissioners voted to kill the purchase after an inspection revealed water damage, mold, and other hazards. Officials said repairs would be too expensive for taxpayers.No public money was spent before the deal was terminated.Commissioner Maria Sachs, who opposed the project from the start, said the county made the right decision once the problems became clear.“The most important thing is that when we realized as a county government that this was not going to work, we withdrew from the contract and we left that so that Uh, we were not going to put our people in a place that was not suitable for them,” Sachs said.With the La Quinta plan scrapped, Sachs said the county is considering alternatives — including tiny homes — as they search for a new site to support residents experiencing homelessness.Meanwhile, people like Dennis Thomas say they simply want a safe place to go.“We don't want to be out here. We want to live normal lives, but sometimes it's hard getting off the streets,” Thomas said.When Hoffman asked what it would mean to have a place to rest his head, Thomas didn’t hesitate.“It takes back a part of your or gives you back a part of your sanity,” he said.WPTV will continue to follow this developing story.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/la-quinta-homeless-housing-plan-collapses-leaving-palm-beach-county-searching-for-alternatives"

"West Palm Beach considers major waterfront upgrades","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach West Palm Beach considers major waterfront upgrades; lane reduction on Flagler sparks debate WPTV's Khalil McLean By: Michael Hoffman Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — West Palm Beach leaders are taking a close look at major changes to the downtown waterfront as part of the city’s new “Your Waterfront Your Way” plan — and one proposed idea is already getting strong reactions from residents.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: West Palm Beach considers major waterfront upgrades; lane reduction on Flagler sparks debate A newly released 89-page report calls the city’s waterfront underused, poorly designed, and in need of significant upgrades. Among the biggest recommendations: reducing Flagler Drive from four lanes to two to make room for expanded bike and pedestrian paths.The idea has residents split.Ed Goulart, who moved to West Palm Beach less than a year ago, says the waterfront already feels just right.“I always take pictures and send it to my family, make them a little bit jealous from back home,” he said.“I'm fairly new to West Palm, and I think it's perfect the way it is.”But the city argues the space could serve the community better. The plan outlines more shade, a redesigned seawall, new multi-use paths, and even the creation of a waterfront department and “waterfront czar.” Consultants say these changes could transform how people experience downtown.For longtime Flagler residents like Sherry Eckstein, the biggest concern is traffic.“The traffic on Flagler over the five years I've lived here has gotten progressively worse,” she said.“It's a gorgeous waterfront. I want people to be able to enjoy it, but not at the risk of terrible traffic and congestion.”Others, like Annie Barbiero, welcome the lane reduction and hope it calms what they see as out-of-control speeding.“Those speed limit signs as a joke, because everybody just speeds. It's wild. This is like the Wild West, really,” she said.“So, yeah, shrink it. Make people walk, make them take the circuit, make them take a water taxi, force them to get some exercise. Why does everybody have to drive everywhere?”Nothing in the plan is final. Commissioners and Mayor Keith James say they’re cautiously optimistic about improvements such as adding shade for events and establishing a waterfront czar. When — or if — construction begins remains unclear.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/west-palm-beach-considers-major-waterfront-upgrades-lane-reduction-on-flagler-sparks-debate"
