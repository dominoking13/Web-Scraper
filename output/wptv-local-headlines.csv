"Martin County teachers to receive pay raise","NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin County Martin County teachers become the highest paid in the Treasure Coast with pay raise The boost in salaries is costing the district nearly $1 million and brings their starting salary to $51,300 WPTV By: Zitlali Solache Posted and last updated MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — Martin County teachers are close to becoming the highest paid on the Treasure Coast.On Tuesday, the school board voted unanimously to ratify an agreement that would boost starting pay. Martin County teachers set to receive raises We first told you about the potential salary increases last week. Teacher union president Matthew Theobald said the goal is to keep the district competitive.“Our teachers helped this district earn an ‘A’ grade, and it since to know that grade ‘A’ teachers are going to be getting grade ‘A’ salaries,” said Theobald.The boost in salaries is costing the district nearly $1 million and brings their starting salary to $51,300.“There are certain areas where Martin County has historically lacked behind our neighbors and what this proposal does, is it emphasizes those years of experience to make them competitive to the surrounding districts,” said Theobald.The agreement puts Martin County on the top of the list for starting teacher salaries on the Treasure Coast. But retired district teacher Ginger Shannon who attended the meeting, believes the increase is still not enough.“33 years now in Martin County and we were never paid what I thought was appropriate salary,” said Ginger Shannon. “It’s not a very big increase. It’ll hardly be felt in anybody’s paycheck.”However, Theobald said Tuesdays’ decision is the beginning to a brighter future for teachers.“A higher salary increase would definitely be helpful, but the proposal is definitely a step on that direction,” said Theobald.Theobald adds the next goal is renewing a millage agreement, which could mean even more pay for teachers. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-martin-county/martin-county-teachers-set-to-receive-raises"

"Family marks 2 years since Oct. 7 attack","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWellington Palm Beach family reflects on 2 years since Oct. 7 attack as Trump peace talks emerge The Rockmacher family shares ongoing impact of Israel-Hamas war as President Trump proposes peace plan WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted WELLINGTON, Fla. — WPTV is tracking high-level talks between Israel and Hamas on President Donald Trump's peace plan, as it is coinciding with the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel.WPTV's Joel Lopez is reconnecting with a family that has been personally affected by this conflict over the years.WATCH BELOW: Joel Lopez sits down with the Rockmacher family Palm Beach family reflects on two years since October 7 attack as Trump peace talks emerge Vivian Rockmacher expressed, “I don’t think anybody anticipated that it would go this long, and it’s heartbreaking.”The ongoing war has profoundly impacted her family’s daily life.“You're constantly looking over your shoulders. You wear a yamaka on your head; you never know what you're going to get, even here in Palm Beach,” said Warren Rockmacher.“I've never felt like a target before in my life, before now, the way we feel right now.”The Rockmacher family, a proud Jewish family, shared their story with WPTV when the war first erupted two years ago.During which they struggled to find flights home for their two children studying in Israel amidst the attacks.Their daughter, Talia Rockmacher, conveyed the gravity of the situation during a phone interview two years ago: “We've been basically hunkered down, we've been going out to get groceries. Our friends have gone to war; we all know people who have been killed and kidnapped.”Their children eventually returned home safely.This brutal assault resulted in the tragic loss of approximately 1,200 Israeli lives, and with around 250 individuals taken hostage, of whom 48 remain in Gaza to this day.In response to the attack, Israel launched an intense military operation.Israel's military response in the last two years has resulted in significant Palestinian casualties, with Gaza's health ministry reporting that around 67,000 Palestinians were killed—about half of whom were women and children.“What do you do when they’re pointing the finger at Israel for genocide on Gaza?” asked Lopez.Warren Rockmacher responded passionately, “We were attacked after 9/11, we went back, and the United States did whatever they had to do after 9/11. No one claimed genocide. Here’s Israel, a sovereign nation attacked, the worst attack since the Holocaust on Jews. Israel goes and tries to defend themselves; all of a sudden, it’s genocide, and the world is turning against them.”The geopolitical landscape is further complicated as many nations recognize or plan to recognize Palestine as a country.WPTV reached out to the Florida Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), which declined interviews related to the October 7th anniversary, but their national chapter posted a statement online that read in part:“It is long past time for the genocide in Gaza to permanently end, for all hostages and political prisoners to go free. The past two years of horror should mark the last chapter, not the latest chapter, in decades of oppression, conflict, and tragedy.”Warren concluded, “We've been livling with this for two years and the most important thing is we need to remember who started this. It wasn’t the Israelis who started it, they did not start this but they will finish it and we hope that it’s finished soon, and we want it to be done peacefully and we want an everlasting peace in the middle east.”In the last two years, their children returned to Israel for humanitarian work and to continue their studies but are back full time in the United States.Despite the ongoing turmoil, their daughter recently got married in Israel, though not without challenges. “I think it was the Wednesday night before the wedding at about 4 in the morning; we were in Tel Aviv, and when those sirens go off and you’re in a dead sleep, you hear them,” Warren recalled.“It rolled us out of bed, not having any idea what was going on. We ran into the bomb shelter, and it’s not an experience I don’t think either one of us want to deal with again, but this is commonplace for the Israelis.”Amid these turbulent times, former President Trump has presented a peace plan aimed at ending the war, calling for a ceasefire that would allow for the release of hostages, prisoners, and those who have died from both Israel and Gaza.The Rockmacher family shared they have a family member fighting in a war and remain cautiously optimistic about the discussions, believing that Trump’s peace plan could be the first step toward bringing this protracted war to an end. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/wellington/palm-beach-family-reflects-on-two-years-since-october-7-attack-as-trump-peace-talks-emerge"
"Port St. Lucie Project Lifesaver gets funding, will remain free to families","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyPort St Lucie Port St. Lucie's Project Lifesaver secures funding to keep helping families track at-risk individuals $6,000 grant allows tracking program for individuals with autism, Alzheimer's and dementia to operate without cost to families WPTV By: Cassandra Garcia Posted PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — A safety program that helps track individuals prone to wandering will continue operating in Port St. Lucie after receiving new funding.Project Lifesaver provides tracking devices to individuals who may be at risk of eloping, like those with autism, Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. The devices allow law enforcement to quickly locate missing persons using specialized transmitters.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Port St. Lucie tracking program for vulnerable residents to remain free thanks to new funding Sarah Durgee enrolled her 17-year-old son Dylan, who has autism, in the program seven years ago.“He requires a lot of assistance [and] constant supervision so there’s always that concern that there could be elopement or that he could encounter people in public that he might not be safe with,” Durgee said. Run by the Port St. Lucie Police Department, the program had been facing a funding gap. While the department had budgeted $15,000 for the program, an increase in equipment costs meant they could no longer cover the cost of new transmitters and batteries.“We provide transmitters [and] batteries for families who may have autistic family members or a family member with dementia and or Alzheimer’s,” said Master Sgt. Dominick Mesiti of the Port St. Lucie Police Department. Families were notified in September that while the program would continue, participants would need to cover the cost of new transmitters and batteries.Durgee said the device offers reassurance in emergencies.“You never know what’s going to happen so it just really gives us that peace of mind and that ease that he’s going to be safe in our home and our environment,” she said.For Durgee, the value of Project Lifesaver goes beyond equipment.“One of the biggest aspects of Project Lifesaver is that it brings the police officers into our home and they get to see what autism looks like,” Durgee said. ""They actually physically put the band, a lot of times, on our children.”She says she reached out to members of the city council and the police chief to share how the program has helped her family. Her concern was not about the cost of the batteries, but rather about losing access to the at-home service.Since then, the department secured a $6,000 grant, allowing families to join and stay in the program without additional cost.“This technology just makes it quicker and easier for us to locate them on top of the other resources that we would utilize,” said Mesiti.Durgee says she’s relieved to see the program continue.“We’re really excited to continue with the program and to just have that security that it’s going to be helping out the autism community and continuing to bring awareness,” she said.The small wearable device is helping deliver peace of mind and in some cases, life-saving support for families like the Durgees. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/port-st-lucie-tracking-program-for-vulnerable-residents-to-remain-free-thanks-to-new-funding"

He began by saying the department values its partnership with the city of Lake Worth Beach.""There's thousands of people that have active administrative immigration warrants, so some of those people are being picked up — those are the people we are going after,"" the lieutenant said.He added that there are designated deputies handling these specific cases and emphasized that PBSO is not conducting raids, targeting, or racially profiling people.Commissioner Christopher McVoy, however, was among the most vocal during the meeting—acknowledging PBSO's role in enforcing laws but urging a shift in focus.""The real stuff—murder, rape, robbery—that's what I want PBSO focusing their energy on,"" McVoy said.He also pushed for more transparency, calling for data that shows who is being detained. ""We need to know racial background, of who's picked up—we need to know names. That's a minimum,"" he said.McVoy added that the city has a long-standing history of advocacy and should continue to speak up for human rights. ""We are a community that has had a tradition of speaking out,"" he said.

Ron DeSantis is proposing that President Donald Trump's presidential library be built in a parking lot that is currently used by Miami Dade College staff and faculty and is adjacent to the Freedom Tower, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025, in Miami. By: Kate Payne, Associated Press/Report for America Posted A Miami activist alleges that city officials violated Florida's open government law when they gifted a sizable plot of prime downtown real estate to the state, which then transferred it to the foundation for Donald Trump's future presidential library.The nearly 3-acre (1.2-hectare) property is a developer’s dream and is valued at more than $67 million, according to a 2025 assessment by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser. One of the last undeveloped lots on an iconic stretch of palm tree-lined Biscayne Boulevard, one real estate expert wagered that the parcel could sell for hundreds of millions of dollars more. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Legal fight looms as Trump library planned in South Florida Trump Presidential Library planned for downtown Miami, sparking backlash Marvin Dunn, an activist and chronicler of local Black history, filed a lawsuit Monday in a Miami-Dade County court against the Board of Trustees for Miami Dade College, a state-run school that previously owned the property. He alleges that the board violated Florida's Government in the Sunshine law by not providing sufficient notice for its special meeting on Sept. 23, when it voted to give up the land, and he's seeking to block the land transfer.Representatives for the college didn't immediately respond to a Tuesday request seeking comment.An agenda released ahead of the meeting simply stated the board would consider conveying property to a state fund overseen by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet, but provided no details on which piece of property was being considered or why. Unlike every other meeting the board has held this year, the 8 a.m. meeting on Sept. 23 was not livestreamed.“No one not already in on the deal would have had any idea from this ‘notice’ of what the District Board of Trustees was actually planning to do,” the lawsuit states.At 8:14 a.m., DeSantis' press office sent out an email announcing he would propose gifting the land for Trump's presidential library.A week later, the governor and his Cabinet made it official, effectively putting the property under the control of the Trump family when they deeded the land to the foundation for Trump’s library. The foundation is led by three trustees: Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and the president's attorney James Kiley.Flanked by glitzy condos, the property overlooks a waterfront park and is across the street from the Miami Heat's arena. Miami Dade College had used it as an employee parking lot, though two decades ago the property was eyed for a major expansion of the college's downtown campus, according to a 2006 report by Miami News.DeSantis has touted the potential benefits the college could see from the presidential library development, though the land deal doesn't guarantee any commitments to the school, which is one of the nation's largest institutions of higher education. The deal only specifies that the parcel must contain “components” of a presidential library or center, with construction starting within five years.
