Forbes' new adventure aims to help kids build confidence, create bonding moments and make wash day fun. ""A lot of curly girls grow up not loving their hair because it wasn't maintained correctly, or like me, I don't know how to do hair,"" Forbes said. Tapping into years of expertise as a cosmetic formulation scientist and countless days of washing and doing her kids' hair, Forbes created the the full-experience brand known as Little Curlies. ""I thought, 'a kids line',"" Forbes said. ""There's a gap in the market right now. Many products say for all curls."" Forbes stresses that all hair is good hair in the activity book she wrote. She also made sure to leave an encouraging note on each product she formulated, especially for the tightest of curls. The product label reads ""Let's celebrate the magic of your crown."" Forbes described the success she's experiencing from her new products as surreal. ""Just be intentional, and the biggest thing is diversity,"" Forbes said. ""Inclusion is the first thing. Not the second."" Right now, Forbes is raising funds to expand her workspace and product line. Her GoFundMe can be found here.

The structure has a direct line of sight to where Air Force One parks at Palm Beach International Airport.""Those are things the Secret Service looks for first and foremost, and in this case, they were able to identify and mitigate it,"" said Tim Miller, a former Secret Service agent.Miller noted this latest security concern comes as Trump has been the target of two assassination attempts in the past 15 months.

"Steep decline in overdose deaths linked to crackdown on treatment facilities","NewsPalm Beach County Overdose deaths drop 60% in Palm Beach County as law enforcement cracks down on treatment facility fraud Decline outpaces statewide trends and positions county ahead of national efforts to combat the drug epidemic, according to local officials WPTV State Attorney Alexcia Cox By: Kayla McDermott Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — Palm Beach County has seen a dramatic 60% decrease in overdose deaths compared to three years ago, marking some of the best progress law enforcement has achieved since the opioid pandemic began nearly 10 years ago.The significant decline outpaces statewide trends and positions the county ahead of national efforts to combat the drug epidemic, according to local officials.WATCH: State attorney attributes decline to crackdown on drug treatment facilities Palm Beach County touts decline in drug overdose deaths ""Just about everyone in our community knows someone who has been affected by substance abuse,"" said Chief Michael Coleman of the Riviera Beach Police Department. Law enforcement across the county has been working for nearly a decade to change that reality, and officials say they are now seeing results. State Attorney Alexcia Cox attributes much of the progress to cracking down on widespread fraud and abuse in drug treatment and sober home facilities. ""It's progress that outpaces statewide trends,"" Cox said. The state attorney's office has made significant strides in addressing the problem through targeted enforcement efforts. ""We've made more than 120 arrests and secured over 110 convictions,"" Cox said. Jim and Adrienne Tichy, who run The Lodge recovery facility in Delray Beach, have witnessed the transformation firsthand. They remember when Delray Beach had hundreds of overdose deaths in a single year in an area that Adrienne Tichy describes as significant to the recovery industry. ""For those that don't know, [it] is the addiction treatment capital of the world,"" Adrienne Tichy said. ""When this first erupted, there was nothing but body bags coming out of this area,"" Jim Tichy said. The Tichys are now part of Delray's drug task force and praise the state attorney's office for its task forces focusing on patient brokering, fraud, and opening dialogue to find solutions in the addiction treatment industry. ""It's a hard job they're doing. They're doing a good job, too,"" Jim Tichy said.Adrienne Tichy acknowledges the industry's past problems while highlighting improvements in standards and oversight. ""Yes, there was corruption. Yes, there was corruption in the recovery residence community, but we have a standardization now. It's called the National Alliance for Recovery Residences, and we're members of both the national and the Florida chapter... There are good treatment centers. There are people doing the best they can with what is out there and and we just stand shoulder to shoulder every day, doing what we can in our neck of the woods,"" Adrienne Tichy said. Cox says these efforts have been vital in decreasing the number of deaths. ""It's a moment of pride for our community,"" Cox said.However, challenges remain. Despite the decrease in overdose deaths, the Tichys say fentanyl usage continues to rise. ""Fentanyl is still there, still alive and well, by a long shot,"" Jim Tichy said.Assistant State Attorney Al Johnson acknowledges that while significant progress has been made, the work continues. ""It's not done, but we've done so much to curb the opioid crisis,"" Johnson said.Another reason for the drops in overdose deaths: Narcan. The Tichys say everyone should have the life-saving drug on them at all times just in case someone is in need.

By: Kate Hussey Posted and last updated STUART, Fla. — A Stuart city manager with more than two decades of service to the city faces potential termination after a commissioner unexpectedly called for his resignation during a public meeting this week, and a WPTV investigation finds taxpayers may foot the bill. WATCH BELOW: 'I applaud Commissioner Reed for taking action,' Robin Cartwright tells WPTV Taxpayers could be on the hook if Stuart city manager is fired Mike Mortell has spent more than 20 years with the city of Stuart — the last two as city manager. Some residents are calling the move to oust him an ambush.The shocking moment came during Monday's commission meeting when Commissioner Sean Reed used an agenda item he requested a week prior to discuss Mortell's contract, then instead moved to replace him.""First I want to say that I totally respect you Mike for what you've done for the city and what you do for the city,"" said Reed, ""but what I'd like to ask for publicly is your resignation."" Stuart residents Ted Astolfi and Robin Cartwright were among seven people who spoke during public comment, and hadn't expected to until Reed's surprising move. Both offered opposing views on the Mortell situation. ""It was shocking. It really was,"" Astolfi said, defending Mortell. ""I was compelled to speak, because suddenly there was this motion right on the box to request the resignation of our city manager, and without any justification, whatsoever."" ""I applaud Commissioner Reed for taking action, because I feel like if you have something that you want to do, you should do it,"" Cartwright said, questioning Mortell's adherence to the city's code of conduct. ""I'm not so much in favor of somebody being fired, I want to be very clear. I'm more in favor of his contract being reviewed. And if he's not abiding by his contract, then the commission holding him to that.""Reed didn't explain his reasoning, saying only he wasn't on the commission when Mortell was hired.

Stuart 'I truly am surprised': City manager at risk of losing job Aja Dorsainvil ""Out of respect for Mike I would rather not open up everything and try to litigate his faults,"" Collins said during the meeting.Residents demanded transparency about the commissioners' reasoning.""The public needs to know your reasoning and thought process and justification for taking this action,"" Astolfi said.""I appreciate them wanting to protect somebody's integrity. But on the flip side, I think if we're going to have this discussion, it needs to be an honest discussion in the public with the public present,"" Cartwright said.WPTV's public records request revealed Mortell's contract, which shows commissioners can fire him without cause. His salary is $225,000, and firing without reason would force the city to pay him 20-weeks severance. Attorney Aaron Bass reviewed the contract and noted the financial implications for taxpayers.""The taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for that if he is not fired for cause,"" Bass said.Bass pointed out the payout doesn't include the costly process of hiring a new city manager.""That's not a cheap thing to do to just set about doing a search to hire a new city manager,"" Bass said. ""That's a lot of money that the taxpayers are going to be paying toward his salary, and the question is, what went on here if they are not firing with cause?""WATCH BELOW: Stuart city manager at risk of losing job Stuart city manager at risk of losing job Stuart Mayor Campbell Rich said he was blindsided by the move and plans to demand answers at the next meeting.""I am not aware of any complaints about Mike's performance and I will be meeting with every department head to ask that,"" Rich said.Collins said taxpayers deserve answers but wouldn't share details about the commissioners' concerns.""Sometimes it's just a personnel switch, you know, and if there's more serious issues that might have been alluded to at the last meeting, I'm sure they'll come out,"" Collins said.""Were you aware of these “serious issues” or were these things that other commissioners just alluded to?"" asked Investigative Reporter Kate Hussey.""It's tough, like we can't talk, so you don't know how, what other interactions have happened,"" responded Collins.

"8 proposals aim to cut property taxes: Here's what Rep. Overdorf told WPTV","MoneyReal Estate News 8 proposals aim to cut property taxes in Florida: Here's what Rep. Toby Overdorf told WPTV 'We will not impact school taxes in any way, nor police and fire,' Overdorf says WPTV State Rep. Toby Overdorf speaks with WPTV reporter Matt Sczesny on Oct. 17, 2025, about new proposals to cut property taxes in Florida. By: Matt Sczesny Posted and last updated PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Florida lawmakers are moving forward with eight proposals aimed at reducing property taxes for homeowners, as rising costs continue to burden residents across the state.State Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Stuart, chairs the Select Committee on Property Taxes and said the panel has one clear objective: cutting property taxes for Florida homeowners.WATCH BELOW: 8 proposals aim to cut property taxes 8 proposals aim to cut property taxes in Florida The committee has identified eight initial proposals for potential relief, including eliminating non-school homestead taxes, improving the homestead exemption, capping tax increases and eliminating what's known as portability restrictions.""We will not impact school taxes in any way, nor police and fire,"" Overdorf said. However, other property taxes are being targeted for potential cuts. One of Overdorf's own proposals, House Joint Resolution 211, would eliminate portability restrictions, allowing homeowners to transfer their tax savings when they move to a new property located in Florida.""People within the state, even if they downsize, would not get hit with a much higher property tax bill?"" WPTV reporter Matt Sczesny asked Overdorf on Friday. ""That is correct. They could take that portability number with them, and in some cases, they may actually not even have to pay property taxes,"" Overdorf said.The proposals face the challenge of reducing funding for counties and cities that rely on property tax revenue. Overdorf acknowledged this concern but believes there's room for cuts without affecting services.""Right now, we're approaching $60 billion just in property taxes across our state. I sincerely believe there is an opportunity for pullback of that revenue within local government and still receive the same services,"" Overdorf said.The timeline for these proposals is moving quickly. Overdorf's committee and other legislative committees will begin studying the proposals next month, with lawmakers potentially voting on them as early as January. The Proposals at a Glance Categorical Eliminations:HJR 201 (Rep. Steele): Eliminates non-school property taxes for homesteads entirely.HJR 203 (Rep. Miller): Phases out those same taxes over ten years, with an additional $100,000 exemption added each year.HJR 205 (Rep. Porras): Exempts Florida residents 65 and older from paying non-school property taxes on homesteads.Additional Exemptions:HJR 207 (Rep. Abbott): Creates a new 25% homestead exemption on non-school taxes — aiding current and first-time homebuyers.HJR 209 (Rep. Busatta): Offers an extra $100,000 exemption to homeowners who carry property insurance, intended to ease overall housing costs.Reforms:HJR 211 (Rep. Overdorf): Eliminates the cap on “portability,” allowing homeowners to transfer their entire Save Our Homes benefit to a new property, even if it’s of lesser value.HJR 213 (Rep. Griffitts): Adjusts caps on taxable value growth — limiting increases to 3% over three years for homesteads (currently 3% annually) and 15% over three years for non-homesteads (currently 10% annually).HB 215 ( Rep. Albert): Would require a two-thirds vote to raise local millage rates and allow newly married couples to combine their Save Our Homes benefits.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

"Union claims new evidence exonerates suspended officers","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyWest Palm Beach West Palm Beach police union claims new evidence exonerates suspended officers Fraternal Order of Police says suspended officers were targeted WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — West Palm Beach's police union believes they've uncovered new evidence that could exonerate seven police officers suspended for their alleged involvement in a ""double-dipping"" scheme.The officers were placed on paid leave last October after being accused of working overtime details during their regular scheduled shifts, effectively getting paid twice for the same hours. WATCH BELOW: Union claims new evidence exonerates suspended officers Union claims new evidence exonerates suspended West Palm Beach officers Documents obtained by the union, shown to WPTV reporter Ethan Stein, show the police department said captains, like those suspended, were able to flex their schedule to work overtime details at other times.""Command Staff positions are subject to flex scheduling and/or hours at the direction and authority of the Chief of Police,"" reads the 12-page document in response to a 2020 city internal audit finding officers were being overpaid back during Fiscal Year 19. ""Management submits that the identified employees (as well as the entire Command Staff) routinely work more than 40 hours per week without ""hourly compensation…The identified 'overlapping' hours would only be relevant if these staffers worked standard hours; they do not and their ability to work some overtime details at unusual hours is authorized by the Chief of Police.""Adam Myers, who is the president of the Fraternal Order of Police in West Palm Beach, said these statements show the city knew about captains changing their schedules to work various overtime details. He also said these documents show that the criminal investigation and internal investigation about the alleged time stealing was never necessary.""This wasn't criminal,"" Myers said. ""This was an internal issue within the department, and these employees were targeted for whatever reason, but that memo right there proved our point.""The seven police officers suspended, according to WPTV's past reporting, include various members of the command staff, including an assistant chief and multiple captains. The police department asked the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office to investigate those officers criminally. However, in April, the sheriff's office announced it didn't find enough evidence to recommend charges. Their investigation found that salaried officers at the West Palm Beach Police Department would change their hours when they had to work various situations or attend meetings. Former Police Chief Frank Adderley explained the situation to investigators from the sheriff's office in body camera video WPTV obtained from a public records request.""You know, if the guys had a homicide like the night before, 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., I don't think he's coming in 8 a.m.,"" Adderley said in the footage.Adderley was fired by Mayor Keith James as police chief last year, citing a variety of instances, including financial improprieties among staff members. James has never specified those claims, but the seven officers were suspended after Adderley’s firing. Letters that WPTV obtained show those officers were placed on paid leave for overtime/financial misconduct.Myers told WPTV that he believes these officers are being targeted by the department.""You gotta question what the motivation is behind this,"" Myers said. ""If the city administration is aware that this issue has been identified and addressed, why did it surface again?""The city of West Palm Beach declined to comment on this story because of an ongoing internal investigation into the officers. However, audio obtained by our newsroom reveals the department's new leadership team believes the suspended captains created a toxic culture, referring to them as ""Seal Team Six.""""Many people who have come forward and say, 'You know, we're so glad that change is happening,' because it appears that many were under the assumption that 'Seal Team Six' was not only stifling careers (but) ruining careers,"" Deputy Chief Tony Shearer said. ""And if you get in the way of their efforts, if you try to openly complain about what they were doing, your career would be in danger.""He said captains were able to pick premium details for overtime first, based on seniority, and then shift their hours to cover the details. He said this led to complaints from the rank-and-file officers.""It was my understanding that because of all the complaints coming from the officers, sergeants and lieutenants, who couldn't do this shift, change adjust,"" Shearer told investigators. ""They were saying this is hypocritical and this is wrong.""However, the union believes these suspended officers should get their jobs back because they did nothing wrong. They are part of a lawsuit, along with some of the suspended officers, working to get their jobs back and return to the department. The next hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. );","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/west-palm-beach-police-union-claims-new-evidence-exonerates-suspended-officers"
"NOAA releases winter outlook: What can we expect?","WeatherWeather News NOAA's winter outlook calls for a warmer winter for much of the US La Niña expected to last through most of winter (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) A pedestrian bundles up as he walks on the street during cold weather in Chicago, Wednesday, Jan. 8, 2025. By: Sami Squires Posted NOAA has released its outlook for the 2025-2026 winter season, and it leans toward warmer-than-average temperatures for a large area of the U.S., including Florida.Stretching from California down the Gulf Coast and up to the northeast, NOAA is expecting overall temperatures to be slightly warmer than normal. Normal highs in December through February in South Florida are in the mid-70s. NOAA A big factor in the forecast is due to La Niña (cooler Pacific waters), which is expected to last through most of winter before transitioning back to a neutral phase (normal conditions) late winter or early spring.During a La Niña winter, temperatures are warmer than normal in the South and cooler than normal in the North. We will also have to keep an eye on drought conditions in the southern U.S. NOAA Portions of the Treasure Coast and Okeechobee are highlighted for possible below-average rain this season. As of October, Central and South Florida are no longer in a drought. But as we head into the dry season, there is still a deficit in annual precipitation totals. Vice versa, a wetter weather pattern is forecast to be more common in northern states, especially in the Pacific Northwest and Midwest. ); About WPTV NewsChannel 5 Join WPTV First Alert Weather Spotters team Jonathan Diego The Day The Sky Turned The Day the Sky Turned: One Year Later WPTV News Surfing Blog Palm Beach Surf Forecast, updated local surf forecast for SE Florida James Wieland","https://www.wptv.com/weather/weather-news/noaas-winter-outlook-calls-for-a-warmer-winter-for-much-of-the-us"
