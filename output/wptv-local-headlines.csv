Food bank officials say delays in November SNAP funding, concerns over a potential federal shutdown and broader economic struggles are putting additional strain on local resources. “Our phone has been ringing off the hook,” Kendall said.Among those waiting for help was Dianna Torres, who drove from Sunrise to Lake Worth.“With two teenage girls, myself and then my mother, it’s hard.

However, the company told the Florida Department of Commerce it now plans to close their West Palm Beach office in a WARN letter released earlier this week. It’s unclear if any of the additional employees were hired as promised.“We were aware we were losing money,” said one employee who sat in meeting with management that were keeping anonymous due to professional reputation in the industry. “…In meetings toward the beginning of the year. We were told that we had to, you know, break even by a certain part that year.”This employee said management made statements about the company’s financial restraints, which was openly discussed in the office as “the rapture,” similar to a trend on social media about the end of the world. The employee then said the company didn’t make payroll.“Everybody was sorta like staring at each other, like this might be it,” the employee said.This employee said he was laid off on Nov. 3, which was the day the company said it expected layoffs to begin in their letter to the Florida Department of Commerce.

He said there are some exceptions for sudden unforeseen circumstances and if there’s a reasonable chance of receiving outside capital from investors to save the company.Barack said he believes the company is trying to cite those exceptions in the letter because the company said it is “providing this notice as soon as practicable” along with touching on possible attempts at receiving outside investment. However, he said he would recommend employees talk with counsel to learn about their legal options.“It depends on what the facts are,” Barack said. “The magical phrase doesn’t get you there. It whether or not you were in fact not able to see these circumstances were going to happen.”MyBambu said it’s working on stabilizing its operations and it won’t reveal how many employees the company has laid off. However, the company said its deeply concerned about ongoing reporting about the company in a statement: “We are deeply concerned that ongoing reporting based on speculation and unverified claims could jeopardize our current funding efforts and, in turn, the livelihoods of our employees and the trust of the customers we proudly serve,” texted a company spokesperson. “We respectfully ask that accuracy and fairness guide any reporting moving forward, as the consequences of misinformation extend beyond headlines—they directly affect real people and families who depend on this company’s continued success.”","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/fintech-firm-mybambu-losing-money-since-start-of-the-year-employee-says"

On Friday, nearly 20,000 flights were delayed with at least 1,400 cancellations across the country, according to FlightAware.WATCH BELOW: Florida lawmakers share thoughts on reduced flight, ongoing shutdown Florida lawmakers share thoughts on reduced flights, ongoing government shutdown Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that restrictions could increase next week as staffing shortages create safety concerns. ""It is not a science, it is an art that we're trying to deploy to keep people safe in the airspace, and we're trying to be trying to prevent the pressure that we now see building in the system,"" Duffy said.The FAA is grounding 10% of flights at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, New York, Atlanta and Charlotte.Government workers in air traffic control and TSA are working without pay during the shutdown, leading to further delays as they struggle to make it into work.

Frankel criticized House leadership for the extended recess during the crisis. ""It's an embarrassment and a disgrace that our Speaker of the House has sent us away for seven weeks,"" Frankel said.Frankel disputed Republican claims about funding the government, arguing their approach would harm Florida residents. ""When they say they voted to fund the government. Now, here's what they did. They voted to throw millions of Floridians off their health care, including hundreds of thousands of veterans. And so it's a misnomer for them to say they voted to fund the government. They voted to fund it the way they want to fund it. We've been out now for seven weeks.

""I never dreamed anything like this would happen.""WATCH: Doctor's fight against breast cancer insurance denials gets a nod from hit drama Florida doctor's fight for breast cancer patients denied insurance coverage gets Hollywood spotlight The episode, which aired last week, told the story of a breast cancer patient undergoing complex breast reconstruction surgery and included a special mention about the federal law that's supposed to protect women who opt for surgery after cancer.However, in real life, that coverage mandated by the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) doesn't always apply.For months, Investigative Reporter Katie LaGrone and Photojournalist Matthew Apthorp have shared the stories of Florida breast cancer patients who were denied insurance coverage for procedures recommended by their physicians, including breast reconstruction surgery.It's a problem Billington and other members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) have been working to fix. Over the summer, they hit the halls of Capitol Hill to speak with lawmakers about introducing new legislation to modernize the 27-year-old law, making it harder for insurance carriers to deny claims.As a result of their efforts, U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida and Debbie Dingell of Michigan recently introduced bipartisan legislation to update the law and expand coverage for breast reconstruction patients to include newer treatments like implants and microsurgical techniques. The legislation also includes safeguards to ensure patients get access to coverage as advancements in breast reconstruction continue to evolve. Dr. Michael Metzner, a practicing physician and friend of Billington's, also happens to be a supervising producer for Grey's Anatomy. He said Billington called him several months ago about the issues her patients were experiencing with insurance denials. Metzner said he’s been pitching an episode about breast reconstruction surgery for years.After getting producers on board and speaking with Billington, he felt the episode needed to address the Women’s Health & Cancer Rights Act.""I think that's a very important piece of information to put out there, because we're trying to educate without people knowing that they're being educated,"" Metzner said.Billington and Metzner agree that the timing of the episode with the recently filed legislation was an unexpected but welcome surprise.""This was truly the aligning of the stars,"" said Metzner.Billington recalls learning about the upcoming episode.""He's like, we're going to mention the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, and I was like, are you kidding me?"" Billington added.Metzner said it was an easy sell since Grey's Anatomy has always fought for patient rights.""Grey's Anatomy has a history of talking about really complex surgical issues, insurance issues, and pretty much patients' rights across the board,"" Metzner said. ""We're trying to educate without people knowing that they're being educated.""That education didn't end on television.In another plot twist Billington didn't see coming, Grey's Anatomy star Jason Winston George, who plays Dr. Ben Warren on the show, took to Instagram to promote the episode and included a videoBillington had previously recorded as part of her ongoing advocacy.""Those of us working the show actually learned some crazy things about the law and health insurance coverage for breast reconstruction surgery. It blew my mind,"" George stated in his video post on Instagram before he pitched it to Dr. Billington as the ""real doctor"" to explain the issue.George ended his post by advocating for change.""The law needs to be modernized to ensure that every woman has access to modern breast reconstruction options. It's that simple,"" he said.Billington didn't know she was being featured in the video until one of her staff members played the video and she heard her voice.""I'm grateful and I'm thankful. I'm just so happy that people think that this is important and are giving these patients a voice,"" Billington said.Voices that are now being amplified by some friends in high places.Billington is hoping to expand the celebrity support for change in the law.""Well, I was going to call Michael to be like, Hey, do you happen to know Taylor Swift's mom?Because Taylor Swift's mom had breast cancer, and she wrote a song about that experience,"" Billington said.""That would be great if they can support this. They would make a huge difference,"" said Billington with a smile.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
