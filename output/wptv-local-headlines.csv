"West Palm beach woman accused of running human trafficking ring","NewsPalm Beach County West Palm Beach woman accused of running human trafficking and prostitution rings with family members Deputies said 31-year-old Laura Saucedo Torres operated several brothels with her husband and her brother WPTV Detectives said Torres fled to Mexico at one point, leaving her three children alone, of ages 17, 12 and 10. By: Zitlali Solache Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — A West Palm Beach woman was arrested last week, accused of running multiple human trafficking and prostitution rings across Palm Beach County alongside her own family.Deputies said 31-year-old Laura Saucedo Torres operated several brothels with her husband and her brother.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: West Palm Beach woman accused of running human trafficking and prostitution rings with family members According to investigators with the Palm Beach County Sheriffs office at least four active brothels were uncovered in Lake Worth and West Palm Beach, where women were being trafficked.WPTV’s Zitlali Solache spoke with Laura Cusack, a human trafficking advocate, about the growing crisis in our local neighborhoods.“I think it definitely opens the eyes of the community to see this is an issue that’s happening right here,” said Cusack, Director of Programs for the Human Trafficking Coalition of the Palm Beaches. “So many people think this is overseas or somewhere else, another state, but it is here in Palm Beach County.”Detectives learned three of the locations were in Lake Worth — on Allison Court, A Street and D Street and another on 30th Court in West Palm Beach.Torres, her husband and her brother allegedly advertised young women for sex, and used threats to maintain their operation in control.Investigators said the group’s network had ties to another brothel WPTV first reported on in February when two Guatemalan men were arrested and accused of human trafficking.“It’s not just a male trafficker,” said Cusack. “It’s not that creepy white van, it can be next door, a female trafficker in broad day light perhaps.”Detectives said Torres fled to Mexico at one point, leaving her three children alone, of ages 17, 12 and 10. One of them was forced to help manage the brothels — transporting victims and handling cash deposits.In one report, a female victim told investigators she came to the area looking for work. She met a man at a restaurant who offered to pay her for a massage. When she arrived at the address, she realized it was a brothel and was told she would have to perform sexual acts with men. The woman told detectives she felt pressured to go along because she needed the money. Eventually, the victim tired to leave and was allegedly threatened with a gun.On June 4, detectives served six search warrants. Inside Torres’ home, investigators found $80,000 in cash hidden inside a stuffed animal and records showing more than $18,000 in wire transfers overseas.Cusack said community awareness plays a huge role in identifying trafficking close to home.“Is there a lot of traffic coming and going from your neighbors house?,” said Cusack. “Different cars, not the same cars every week, different cars, coming and going in all hours of the night. More awareness like that can lead to more arrests, can lead to making our community safer and eradicating human trafficking.”Court records do not indicate Torres' husband and brother have any pending charges related to the case.","https://www.wptv.com/news/palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach-woman-accused-of-running-human-trafficking-and-prostitution-rings-with-family-members"
"Decade-old Trump lawsuit resurfaces amid new flight restrictions over Palm Beach","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyPalm Beach Decade-old Trump lawsuit resurfaces amid new flight restrictions over Palm Beach neighborhoods WPTV's Caleb Holder By: Michael Hoffman Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — As new federal flight restrictions push planes away from Mar-a-Lago and over nearby neighborhoods, a decade-old lawsuit filed by Donald Trump shows this isn’t the first time he’s fought to change flight paths over Palm Beach.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Decade-old Trump lawsuit resurfaces amid new flight restrictions over Palm Beach neighborhoods In 2011, Trump filed a 68-page lawsuit, uncovered by WPTV’s Michael Hoffman, against Palm Beach County and Palm Beach International Airport (PBIA), seeking to stop the expansion of the airport. The lawsuit called for “barring of flights over or near Mar-a-Lago,” alleging that the constant flying of planes over the estate caused damage to the historic structure and that the noise created a public nuisance.Now, residents in neighborhoods like Flamingo Park say they’re dealing with the very same problems Trump once described.Residents say new restrictions are impacting daily lifeRecent changes from the FAA and U.S. Secret Service have expanded flight restrictions around Mar-a-Lago to be in effect 24/7, redirecting planes away from the estate and over nearby historic neighborhoods.The agencies say the expansion is for security purposes. But residents say the noise and disruption are affecting their health, property, and peace of mind.“What no one seems to be able to get a hold of at this point is what exactly is the threat when he's not in residence?” said Nevin Bauman.“It does seem like an extreme change of format,” added Stephen Sanders.Residents echo Trump’s old complaints — from the other side of the flight pathTrump’s lawsuit more than a decade ago argued that flights over Mar-a-Lago were damaging the property and creating an unbearable noise problem.Today, residents near the airport are making the same arguments about planes being pushed over their homes instead.“Our homes are not prepared for the impact of the sounds that we are receiving,” said Suzette Green.“My concern is, like many other things, this one-year, temporary experiment is just a way of getting us used to what is going to become permanent,” said Linda Stein. “This cannot be made permanent.”Future of flight restrictions unclearThe FAA and airport officials say they are still working on a plan to present to the Palm Beach County Commission. Until then, the future of the restrictions — and the direction of flights over Palm Beach — remains up in the air.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/palm-beach/decade-old-trump-lawsuit-resurfaces-amid-new-flight-restrictions-over-palm-beach-neighborhoods"

"Flight delays persist at Palm Beach International Airport amid restrictions","NewsPalm Beach County Flight delays continue at Palm Beach International Airport amid nationwide air traffic restrictions More than 80,000 flights delayed and 30,000 canceled nationwide this week according to FlightAware WPTV By: Ange Toussaint Posted WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Flight delays and cancellations continue at airports across the country, impacting more than 86,000 flights since the FAA imposed air traffic restrictions on Friday.At Palm Beach International Airport, travelers are still feeling the effects. While operations appeared calmer Tuesday, many passengers described frustration over limited communication from airlines.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Flight delays continue at Palm Beach International Airport amid nationwide air traffic restrictions “They cancelled our flight- basically PBI was closed at 11:30, and we sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes,” said traveler Nick Vannice, whose Delta flight to Palm Beach was canceled Monday night.Vannice said he and other passengers were left confused after receiving little information from airline staff.“There was no communication. We literally sat on the plane, and everybody got confused. There was no clarity,” he said, adding that the cancellation caused him to miss a day of work.Another traveler, St. Lucie County resident Nick Kasper, described his experience as “a nightmare.”“When we were descending, all of a sudden the captain comes on and says, ‘Guys, we’ve got bad news. West Palm Beach is closed—there’s no one in the tower, so we’re diverting you to Fort Lauderdale,’” Kasper said.He told WPTV he and other passengers were left stranded at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport without airline representatives to help.“This is the worst experience I’ve ever had,” he said. “I understand air traffic control is out of United’s control, but a bus- I mean, a simple bus - they could’ve done that.”“Once we got off the plane we were totally on our own. I’ve never seen anything like it before,” he added.Palm Beach International Airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the closure. In a previous email, an airline spokesperson said “reductions in airline schedules elsewhere may impact flights scheduled to fly to PBI.”United Airlines also did not respond to a request for comment. The FAA said airlines are required to issue full refunds for cancellations but are not obligated to provide compensation for meals or hotels.Despite the frustrations, flight activity at PBI appeared to stabilize Tuesday, with only a handful of delays. Some travelers reported smoother experiences.“I think things are relatively normal,” said passenger Cory Haupt, who’s visiting Palm Beach County. “It appears that the airlines have changed their schedule, so what you see is what you get, but so far, so good.”According to FlightAware, more than 80,000 flights were delayed and over 30,000 were canceled nationwide this week.Federal employee and traveler Renee Reynolds said she’s hopeful conditions improve soon.“I’m just thankful that they’re willing to work at the moment and still not getting paid, and I think that’s the challenge for folks,” she said.","https://www.wptv.com/news/palm-beach-county/flight-delays-continue-at-palm-beach-international-airport-amid-nationwide-air-traffic-restrictions"
"'Too long': 50-year mortgage proposal sparks debate over home affordability","MoneyReal Estate News 50-year mortgage proposal sparks debate over home affordability in Palm Beach County WPTV's Vannia Joseph is speaking to financial experts who say the real fix isn't lengthening loans, but lowering interest rates WPTV By: Vannia Joseph Posted and last updated PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — A new proposal from the Trump administration is stirring debate about how to make homeownership more affordable. The idea — a 50-year mortgage loan, is being pitched as a way to lower monthly payments and help more Americans buy homes.WATCH BELOW: 'You're probably going to end up paying higher interest,' Chuck Czajka tells WPTV 50-year mortgage proposal sparks debate over home affordability But local experts said it could come with long-term financial consequences.In Palm Beach County, home prices are already pushing many buyers to their limits, a 50-year mortgage could help some qualify for a home, but a local finance experts said it's a decision that could keep you paying long past retirement.President Donald Trump introduced the 50-year loan proposal this week. Administration officials said it's designed to make housing more accessible for middle-class families by stretching payments over a longer period.""It depends on what the rate is on any mortgage, right?"" One shopper WPTV spoke to said.Meanwhile, a new national survey shows people are waiting longer to buy their first home — the median age now 40 years old.Here in Palm Beach County, where the median household income is just under $83,000 and the median home price sits around $480,000, local buyers would need to earn well into six figures to comfortably afford a home, according to most mortgage calculators.Some residents aren't convinced a longer mortgage is the answer.""No, that's too long,"" one woman said. ""Age does play a big role,"" another added. National News Trump hints at 50-year mortgages. Here’s what that would actually mean Scripps News Group Local financial expert Chuck Czajka, founder of Macro Money Concepts, said the concept may sound appealing but comes with major tradeoffs.""Spanning a mortgage out over 50 years, you're basically almost talking about an interest-only loan,"" Czajka said. ""It's going to take you a long time to create that principal and gain equity in your home — and you're probably going to end up paying higher interest.""Czajka said the real fix isn't lengthening loans, but lowering interest rates.""When you look at a standard 30-year mortgage, you really don't start knocking out principal until year 22,"" he said.While he acknowledges a 50-year loan could help younger buyers get started, he warns it could also keep many homeowners paying into their 70s or 80s.When asked if it could help with today's affordability crisis, Czajka didn't mince words.""My honest opinion — no. I think it's going to help the middle man. It's going to help realtors, it's going to help bankers, it's going to help mortgage people,"" Czajka said. ""I don't think it's going to help the day-to-day person do anything other than get into a house that they're probably going to find out they can't afford.""

No, the police building is not infested with mold. Are there instances with mold that is being addressed? Absolutely, and we are addressing that. But, everything you hear isn’t true and consider the source.” Mayor James made his comments after Commissioner Christy Fox proposed selling the downtown police station and moving it to the historic northwest neighborhood, specifically where the city leases land to the Salvation Army. Fox argued the city could use the money from the sale to create a new public safety building, which would also contain a fire station, rather than spend $6 million dollars on repairs to the building. West Palm Beach City to cover medical costs for police officers sickened by mold Ethan Stein “Our police are currently working out of a building that is completely mold-infested,” Fox said. “We’re spending $6 million at the moment, which will probably balloon to $12 to $20 million. They’re being sent home to work from home because it’s so toxic. Why are we allowing this to happen? We should be demolishing this building.” Commissioner Cathleen Ward she heard from Police Chief Tony Araujo that the mold issue isn’t as bad as people are portraying. But she acknowledged the land is valuable real estate.COMMISSIONERS: WE NEED MORE INFORMATION FROM MAYOR’S OFFICEThree different city commissioners said they would like to see an increase in the amount of information shared with them about the city’s operations at Monday’s commission meeting as well. Those three commissioners made the request after Adam Myers, president of the union for the city’s police officers, spoke at public comment about the city not reinstating five captains on paid administrative leave for allegations they worked overtime details during regular scheduled hours, commonly called “double dipping."" Commissioner Fox, who out of the three who made the request spoke most passionately about the need for more information, said she’s hasn’t received an update on the reason those officers are being placed on administrative leave since she asked for an update at the last commissioner meeting. She said a similar situation occurred regarding plans for the Salvation Army’s building in the city’s northwest neighborhood.Commissioner Ward, who claimed she was denied a meeting by the mayor’s office with the city’s police chief at a prior meeting, reiterated those sentiments about needing more information. She expressed concern that she wasn’t aware of a $10 million-dollar plan with the Salvation Army building, which Fox brought up during the meeting. West Palm Beach Mold, poor air quality at headquarters prompts relocation of command staff Ethan Stein “When we ask for workshops or when we ask presentations, we’re not trying to be difficult. We just want the information so we can share it with our residents,” Ward said. “It’s not a power grab. It’s nothing other than we’re doing our job.”Commissioner Christina Lambert, who was endorsed by Mayor James to succeed him as mayor, reiterated the need for “improved” information in a prepared speech made during the meeting. She said she respects the administration’s “tough decisions” in leadership, but expressed the need to have knowledge about the city to properly perform the job.“When commissioners aren’t included in early conversations or fully utilized in decisions that impact the city, it makes it harder for us to do our jobs and represent our residents effectively,” Lambert said. “…As commissioners we also have a duty to provide checks and balances and to make sure our residents understand what’s happening.”Mayor James didn’t respond to those concerns during Monday’s meeting. A spokesperson sent WPTV this statement from the mayor: The health and safety of our employees will always be our highest priority. We are taking every necessary precaution to ensure that our Police Department staff work in an environment that is safe, secure, and supported. Our continued testing and remediation efforts reflect our unwavering commitment to the well-being of those who serve our community.","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/west-palm-beach/west-palm-beach-mayor-addresses-police-headquarters-mold-issues-for-first-time"
