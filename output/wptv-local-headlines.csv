"Lake Worth Beach debates charter changes for development","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion C Palm Beach CountyLake Worth Beach Lake Worth Beach commissioners debate charter changes for potential oceanfront development Residents oppose H.O.R.I.Z.O.N. project that could bring Hyatt hotel and 120-foot height exception to beachfront H.O.R.I.Z.O.N By: Zitlali Solache Posted LAKE WORTH BEACH, Fla. — During a nearly five-hour special meeting Monday night, Lake Worth Beach city commissioners discussed several potential charter changes, including some that could pave the way for new development along the city’s oceanfront.Commissioners voted to move forward with two proposed charter amendments as referendum items, one related to lease terms for properties east of A1A, and another for lease terms on other city-owned properties.However, a proposed amendment to increase building height limits will not move forward as a referendum item.We first told you about the project last month, known as H.O.R.I.Z.O.N. Many residents told WPTV they feared the charter changes would open the door for a new five-acre project beside Lake Worth Beach.The proposal includes a Hyatt-branded hotel, a redesigned Jack Nicklaus golf course, and a relocated community pool.Last month, developers asked the city to place questions on the ballot, including one for a 99-year lease on city-owned land east and west of A1A and another to allow a height exception up to 120 feet.Many residents, like Ginny Powell, said it’s too much change for their beach town.“I don’t want to see a wall of high rises down Lake Avenue,” Powell said. “We want to see smart growth. We don’t want to see overdevelopment. We want to keep our historic charm.”Several attendees at the meeting also called for more community engagement before any future charter changes move forward. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/region-c-palm-beach-county/lake-worth-beach/lake-worth-beach-commissioners-debate-charter-changes-for-potential-oceanfront-development"
"Dive team finds missing man's body after 10-year search","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoca Raton Private dive team solves 10-year-old missing person case, finds Steven MacKrell's body in Boca Raton pond Sunshine State Sonar discovered Steven MacKrell's remains in Boca Raton pond after conducting more than 400 searches WPTV's Caleb Holder By: Michael Hoffman Posted and last updated BOCA RATON, Fla. — After a decade of uncertainty, investigators say they’ve found the body of 25-year-old Steven MacKrell, bringing long-awaited answers to his family and it’s all thanks to a private dive team that made the discovery.In an exclusive interview with WPTV, the team behind the recovery shared how they solved a cold case that had stumped investigators for years.WATCH BELOW: WPTV's Michael Hoffman sits down with the founder of Sunshine State Sonar Dive team solves 10-year-old missing person case, finds Steven MacKrell's body in Boca Raton pond Beneath the dark waters of a Boca Raton pond, a mystery that lasted 10 years has finally been uncovered.It was the early hours of July 30, 2015, when surveillance video captured MacKrell at a Valero Gas Station in Pompano Beach. Another clip showed him driving away in his 2013 Ford Fusion. That was the last time anyone saw him alive.In the years after his disappearance, investigators tried to piece together what happened that night, but eventually, according to police documents, “exhausted all leads.”Seven years later, Michael Sullivan, founder of Sunshine State Sonar, and his private dive team stepped in.“We started working on that case,” said Sullivan.Sullivan and his team searched hundreds of bodies of water across South Florida, marking each location as they went. Then, he says, one team member came forward with a theory.“She says, I’ve got a theory. Steven gets on 95, he goes north a couple exits. As soon as he gets off this exit, he makes a left. If he continues down that road, it dead ends into the water,” Sullivan recalled.After years and more than 400 searches, they decided to check one more spot — and this time, their sonar revealed something different.“It’s over three years looking for Steven MacKrell. It’s finally over. We found him,” Sullivan said as they found MacKrell.The Boca Raton Police Dive Team responded and pulled the 2013 Ford Fusion from the pond. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed that the remains inside were indeed MacKrell’s.For Sullivan and his team, the discovery brought a sense of relief.“We’re just happy that we can provide them with these answers, and they no longer have to wonder, you know, what happened to the son, the brother and family member and friend,” said Sullivan.While the recovery provides long-awaited closure for MacKrell’s family, the case isn’t officially closed.Investigators with the Fort Lauderdale Police Department are still asking anyone with information about that night in 2015 to come forward.If you have any information, contact Fort Lauderdale Police or submit an anonymous tip to Broward Crime Stoppers at 800-458-TIPS. ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boca-raton/private-dive-team-solves-10-year-old-missing-person-case-finds-steven-mckrells-body-in-boca-raton-pond"
"Brightline gets $42M for safety upgrades as Boca ridership grows","LifestyleTravel Brightline ridership surges in Boca Raton as $42 million in federal safety grants arrive Rail service will expand from 19 to 28 daily trips in Boca Raton while federal funding addresses safety concerns WPTV's Ange Toussaint By: Ange Toussaint Posted BOCA RATON, Fla. — Daily train travel is on the rise in Boca Raton, proof that the demand for rail service across Florida is growing.Brightline says new federal funding will finally bring long-delayed safety upgrades to its South Florida corridor.WATCH WPTV'S COVERAGE BELOW: Brightline ridership surges in Boca Raton as $42 million in federal safety grants arrive Riders like Sofia Savino say the service has become part of their daily routine.“I travel a lot to Orlando because my sister lives up there. It’s super easy don’t have to get stuck in traffic,” Savino said.According to Brightline, ridership across Palm Beach County has increased over the past year. The company plans to expand its Boca Raton schedule from 19 daily trips to 28.“We’ve seen a lot of demand and a lot of growth from the Boca residents and the Boca market,” a Brightline representative said.Brightline said in a statement announcing the network expansion that 80% of South Florida trains and 90% of Orlando-bound trains include a Boca Raton stop.But as ridership climbs, so does the need for safety. Since Brightline began operating in Florida in 2018, more than 100 people have died in train-related incidents.Company officials say $42 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT)- funding that had been backlogged since 2022- will be used to address critical rail safety projects.The grant will go toward four major projects, including the following: fencing, signage, new technology, and enforcement programs in Palm Beach County. Here is the full list of projects according to Brightline:A grant for $24,934,138 announced in August 2022 to the Florida Department of Transportation for improvements to 330 highway-railroad crossings, along 195 miles of corridor, including fencing, crossing delineators, crisis support signage and other intrusion prevention mitigations.A grant for $1,648,000 was announced in September 2023 for a Trespassing Identification and Classification System under the CRISI Grant Program for FY22. The project will advance a technology that will provide real-time alerts and aggregate data to generate heat maps of trespassing and potential collision events on the Florida East Coast Railway right of way from Miami to Cocoa.A grant for $15,440,000 was announced in June 2023 to increase safety at 21 grade crossings along the Brightline/Florida East Coast Railway corridor with additional crossing gates and delineators.A grant for up to $150,000 was announced in October 2024 for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office to support overtime costs for targeted enforcement of pedestrian trespassing at identified hot spots.Ashley Blasewitz, director of media relations for Brightline, said the company is prioritizing education and prevention.Every one of these instances is tragic, but they’re also preventable,” Blasewitz said. “Making sure that the education, enforcement, and engineering solutions are in place — and letting people know they cannot beat the train, to stay behind the white line, to obey the safety protocols — is one of our top priorities.” ; }).then();","https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boca-raton/brightline-ridership-surges-in-boca-raton-as-42-million-in-federal-safety-grants-arrive"

"Scientists warn rare reef found only in Florida could be destroyed again","News 'Out of sight, out of mind': Scientists warn rare Florida reef could be destroyed again Scientists say the Oculina Bank, found nowhere else on Earth, could vanish forever under Trump administration fishing order Matthew Kauerauf/ WPTV News Dr. Grant Gilmore, who previously dived the rare Oculina Bank off Fort Pierce, raises concern about a reef that may be opened back up to shrimp trawling. By: Kate Hussey Posted FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Beneath the surface of the Atlantic, about 15 miles off the coast of Fort Pierce, lies one of the most unique coral reefs in the world — and one of the most fragile.Known as the Oculina Bank, this 300-square-mile deep-water reef was the first of its kind ever discovered. WATCH: Protected ecosystem could be destroyed due to executive order Scientists warn rare reef found only in Florida could be destroyed again But this protected ecosystem now faces potential destruction as federal officials consider reopening parts of it to shrimp trawling after decades of restrictions.The South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, one of eight federally appointed councils across the country, proposed two amendments this year that would allow commercial shrimp boats to drag massive nets across portions of the reef. The proposals directly respond to a Trump administration executive order calling for reduced fishing regulations and enhanced economic opportunities for the seafood industry.""We would be killing accidentally and incidentally many 100-year-old coral systems that support literally thousands of different species,"" said Jim Moir, executive director of Indian River Keeper. The Oculina Bank sits 200 to 300 feet below the surface, built from a rare coral called Oculina varicosa that glows white in the deep, dark waters. Unlike most reefs that need shallow sunlight, this unique ecosystem thrives in the depths. Yacht no more: Artificial reef to help replenish rare coral Joel Lopez Dr. Grant Gilmore, a marine scientist who has dived the reef, described towering coral formations reaching 50 feet high and stretching for miles. ""This is extremely unique,"" Gilmore said. ""That species only occurs along this coast of Florida, and no place else."" Federal scientists discovered the reef in 1975, documenting an underwater paradise teeming with snapper, grouper and thousands of other species. By 1984, the government declared it a ""Habitat Area of Particular Concern."" But scientists say shrimp trawling devastated the ecosystem, and discovered 90% of the reef was destroyed by the early 2000s as massive nets dragged across the seafloor, scooping up everything in their path.""It's just rubble on the bottom,"" Gilmore said. ""You can see the scars from the otter doors. You can see occasionally nets that have broken off."" WPTV The federal government created the nation's first marine protected area in 1994, temporarily closing a third of the reef to trawling. The federal government responded by creating the nation's first marine protected area in 1994, temporarily closing a third of the reef to trawling. Protections later expanded to most of the reef and became permanent. Now the federally appointed council wants to reverse course.Industry struggles amid space launches and importsBob Zales, executive director of the Southeastern Fishing Association and a generational shrimper, believes reopening access is essential for the struggling rock shrimp industry.""The shrimping industry is teetering on the brink of extinction,"" Zales said.Council data shows the rock shrimp industry has plummeted from over 700 trips per year in the mid-1990s to under 100 since 2010. The number of active rock shrimpers dropped from 144 in 1996 to less than 30, with just 12 active boats in 2018.Zales attributes the decline to high costs, competition from imported shrimp and closures of previously open fishing areas. Space launches have created another challenge. Coast Guard records WPTV obtained show waters off Port Canaveral were restricted at least 50 times this year due to rocket launches.""When these launches go up or are scheduled to go up, they have to shut down access to the area for safety reasons,"" Zales said.Amendment 11 would reopen a 16-square-nautical-mile area along the northeastern edge of the Oculina Bank to shrimp trawling. Amendment 12 would expand access to 24 nautical miles.""Every little bit helps,"" said Zales. Economic arguments favor reef protectionDr. Edie Widder, a marine biologist who has studied deep-water reefs for decades, argues the ecological cost of opening the bank to trawling would far outweigh the fishery's small economic return.""The rock shrimp fishery is a niche market,"" Widder said. ""It's a very small market compared to the commercial fishery and the recreational fishery in Florida.""NOAA data WPTV dug up supports this assessment. In 2023, brown rock shrimp landed nationwide totaled just 600,000 pounds worth $1 million. That same year, Florida fishermen alone landed nearly 100 million pounds of fish worth just under $300 million — species like snapper and grouper that depend on the reef to spawn. Previous council studies show that between 2003 and 2014, only 1.7% of shrimping took place inside the reef — fewer than 2 trips out of every 100. ""If you just want to do it on an economic basis, you want to sustain that commercial fishery and that recreational fishery, you need to be able to sustain the spawning grounds,"" Widder said. ""It's just basic biology.""Public overwhelmingly opposes reopeningAbout 150 people from across the country submitted comments to the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council. Approximately 120 opposed both proposals, citing environmental concerns. Only 25 people supported both amendments, while five backed one amendment but not the other.Many pushing to reopen the bank argue the areas in question no longer hold living coral. The council's own proposal cites NOAA mapping that in 2022 ""did not note the presence of live, standing, dead or coral rubble within the proposed areas for shrimp trawling.""But that same study warned sediment from trawling could drift into the reef and smother living coral, while snapper and grouper could be swept up as bycatch.""It's the nursery for those fish species that are going to be supplying our children and our great-grandchildren's future fish,"" Moir said. ""We're risking covering these corals with plumes of sediment that are dragged up from the bottom and carried over those coral reefs by the currents that exist on the bottom.""Widder expressed skepticism about the industry's ability to avoid environmental damage.""I think they're being overly optimistic about how they can place their nets,"" Widder said.

"Homeowners seek options after gov't shutdown halts this program","MoneyReal Estate News Government shutdown halts National Flood Insurance Program, leaving homeowners seeking alternatives Florida officials push for program extension as private insurers offer alternatives during hurricane season WPTV By: Matt Sczesny Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The federal flood insurance program has come to a sudden halt due to the ongoing government shutdown, prompting concerns from Florida officials and forcing homeowners to explore private insurance options as storm season continues.The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is currently on hold, preventing new policies from being issued and existing policies from being renewed while the government remains shut down.WATCH BELOW: Gov't shutdown halts National Flood Insurance Program; here's what you can do Government shutdown halts National Flood Insurance Program Former Florida Chief Financial Officer and current U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., expressed hope for a resolution to the political standoff.""I'm hopeful we have cooler heads prevail in the Senate,"" Patronis told WPTV reporter Matt Sczesny.Republicans and Democrats continue to blame each other for the shutdown. Democrats cite concerns over federal subsidies for the Affordable Care Act as a key sticking point.""Democrats are holding back until we can fix what is a looming crisis, which is running out of federal subsidies for the Affordable Care Act,"" said U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-Fla.The program suspension comes at a critical time, with storm season still active along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Patronis is supporting legislation to extend the program through mid-November.""We're piling on this together to try and get the NFIP extended because it's a concern for everyone along the Gulf Coast, the Atlantic coast, as storm season is not over yet, and it's not if but when a storm will hit,"" Patronis said.However, Florida property owners have alternatives beyond the federal program. Private flood insurance companies are actively writing policies throughout the state, according to Robert Norberg of Arden Insurance in Lantana.""Fortunately, we have more private markets than ever,"" Norberg said.Private insurers offer several advantages over the federal program, including competitive rates and enhanced coverage options.""Competitive rates, better coverage in many cases, most of my clients have opted for the private flood option, they do satisfy all the banks, so you don't have to worry about lenders, and most of those have a lower waiting period too,"" Norberg said.Property owners with current federal flood insurance policies can rest assured that any claims will still be covered despite the program suspension.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
