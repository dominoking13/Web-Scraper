"Teen helps several stranded drivers after flash flood in Boca Raton","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoca Raton Boca Raton teen helps several people stranded in flash flood Thomas Ruzzano Thomas Ruzzano approaches the vehicle and helps the elderly man to safety. By: Zitlali Solache Posted BOCA RATON, Fla. — A Boca Raton teen is being credited for helping rescue stranded drivers after a flash flood hit the area Sunday night. Thomas Ruzzano, 18, was at the movie theater at Mizner Park with his girlfriend when they heard thunderstorms.“During the movie, we just heard lightning, pouring the whole movie and then on the way out, we’re in a flood,” said Ruzzano. “We were going down the road, and we just see cars backed up. The whole roundabout, the whole entire garage, everything, even the bathrooms in the movie theaters flooded.”The flash flood brought strong winds and lightning, leaving sections of the city submerged under water. According to Doppler Radar, Boca Raton experienced an estimated 8 inches of rain Sunday.Ruzzano recalls the moment he jumped into the water to help drivers near Mizner Park. WPTV WPTV's Zitlali Solache sat down in an interview with Ruzzano, hours after the rescue. “I went from car to car. Probably six or seven people just going car to car, making sure everyone was okay,” said Ruzzano.Even the people Ruzzano rescued stepped up, joining in to help an elderly man who was trapped in his car.“He was actually stuck in the car and we had to help him out. I think he was a little lost of the whole situation, so we helped him,” said Ruzzano. “He was trying to push the car after we got him out and we were like ‘No sir. We just have to get you to safety, make sure you’re okay.’ We brought him to a restaurant nearby and just made sure he’s okay.”Ruzzano said he relied on his instincts, a trait he credits to his family.“I learned it from my dad, he always taught me and raised me right,” said Ruzzano.Though drenched on the ride home, Ruzzano said it’s a night he’ll never forget and one that left many grateful he was there.“They were just very thankful and they kept telling me how lucky they were to have me there,” said Ruzzano.

"'We need help': Residents urge city action on flooding problems","NewsPalm Beach CountyRegion S Palm Beach CountyBoca Raton Stranded and frustrated: Boca Raton residents urge city action on flooding problems WPTV crews captured the scene, where the flooding in the roadway was close to knee-level WPTV By: Joel Lopez Posted BOCA RATON, Fla. — The aftermath of Sunday night's storm left some Boca Raton residents feeling trapped—not just physically, but also emotionally. The intensity of the overnight rains raised alarm bells for countless residents, who are now turning to WPTV for assistance. Boca Raton neighborhood flooded after overnight rains As streets turned into rivers, the cries for help and action from the city echoed through the affected neighborhoods.“The city needs to do something about it, what are they waiting for? When it's in my house?” said Silvia Janson, one of the frustrated locals.She stood on the edge of her 19th Street property with disbelief and anger, as she surveyed the floodwaters that have her trapped — her car can't make it through the water.“We have debris, we have Halloween stuff we don’t know who it belongs to, we have basketball hoops floating, we have two cars that were floating,” said Janson. ""I'm devastated, I'm mad, I'm angry, I'm a lot of things."" She recounted how her son had to spend the night at a friend’s place after his car couldn’t navigate the flooded streets. “I cannot believe we didn’t even have a hurricane, and this is happening in front of my house,” she said.WPTV crews captured the scene, where the flooding in the roadway was close to knee-level.Janson shared a video from Sunday night where the water reached the front of her house.The chaos didn't stop with Janson’s home.Across the street, Angela Bartolotti shared her own frustrations after being stranded at home with her daughter, who was unable to attend school due to the flooding.“It’s terrible, it’s scary. I mean, if this would have been a hurricane, we would be in trouble,” Bartolotti stated, emphasizing the severity of the storm's impact.Bartolotti noted a concerning trend of increasing flooding over the years, making Sunday night’s storm the worst she’s ever witnessed. Real Estate News Flood insurance in Florida: Why is it overlooked despite risks? Matt Sczesny What message do you have to city leaders?” WPTV""s Joel Lopez asked in an effort to address the escalating crisis, prompting Bartolotti to plead for action: “Please come and assess it. We need some kind of drainage. Maybe not think about building all these condos, think about keeping this infrastructure healthy, what it is now, before you start building something else because it needs to be addressed.” WPTV took their concerns to Zachary Bihr, the Public Works and Engineering director of Boca Raton. He explained that the city received upwards of nine inches of rain in just two hours during the storm.He said there is a pipe drainage system in Palm Beach Farms that feeds water into the canals, but because of the quantity of water in the short amount of time, their systems were overwhelmed and couldn't keep up. When pressed about the city’s plans to address these critical infrastructure issues, he acknowledged the challenge: “Last night’s storm was extraordinary and intense, with some high intensity thunderstorms.” Bihr assured residents that efforts were underway to monitor trouble spots and assess the existing infrastructure, stating, “Yes, I have been out actually through the night to get a report, and we're monitoring with staff.”He said that data will be used for an ongoing initiative known as the Innovative Sustainable Infrastructure Program (iSIP), that Palm Beach Farms is a part of. According to the city website, it's a long-term initiative that uses technology and data to evaluate, prioritize and improve critical underground areas throughout the city. By using a mapping inventory system, areas will be identified and prioritized based on the age, location, and deterioration of water and sewer pipes and neighborhood roads.Based on results, parts of the city could receive essential updates to stormwater systems and water mains. Palm Beach Farms is scheduled for construction in spring 2026.Bihr mentioned that resources such as pumps are being allocated to prioritize critical routes for first responders but acknowledged they have contractors on call and will move into neighborhoods depending on the need. City officials are expecting more rain Monday evening and are urging residents to remain at home and off the roads.They encourage residents to report clogged storm drains by calling 561-416-3402. For those stranded in rising waters, the Boca Raton Police Department’s non-emergency number is 561-368-6201.Bihr said he planned to address city flooding at the commission meeting Monday night.

"Fort Pierce police chief search: Debate emerges on who to hire","NewsTreasure CoastRegion St Lucie CountyFort Pierce Fort Pierce police chief search: Debate emerges on who to hire Officers agree on qualifications but disagree on where the hire should originate WPTV By: Ethan Stein Posted FORT PIERCE, Fla. — A debate is emerging within the Fort Pierce Police Department to determine if its next police chief should come from an internal promotion or external hire, according to new documents WPTV received from a public records request.The position has remained unfilled since Police Chief Diane Hobley-Burnley resigned in May. Her resignation came after a report made an extensive request for recommendations for the agency, even though it found the agency performed quality law enforcement services.WATCH BELOW: Debate emerges on who to hire as next Fort Pierce police chief Fort Pierce police chief search: Debate emerges on who to hire WPTV also obtained a union survey revealing a deep dissatisfaction among Fort Pierce police officers, who critiqued the chief over her lack of visibility within the department and a ""hostile"" work environment. WPTV anchor Meghan McRoberts also reported on an internal investigation that found decades of mismanaged evidence, ultimately leading to cases being dropped or people losing personal belongings.According to a spokesperson for the city of Fort Pierce, the city will spend about $25,000 on a search firm to hire the next police chief. As part of the search, the city also conducted a survey to gather input from officers with the department as well as comments from the general public.WPTV reporter Ethan Stein obtained those responses from a public records request. The most common trait mentioned by police employees and the general public was the word ""experience"" and police officers often emphasized the importance of ""local"" law enforcement experience. City of Fort Pierce Some officers acknowledged the current situation within the department, inherited from the prior chief, might need an outsider with a fresh perspective.For example, one officer said St. Lucie County Deputy and former candidate for Indian River County Sheriff Chief Milo Thornton should become the next chief because everybody would be judged without the past prejudices.""Milo Thornton should be the next Chief, due to the fact that he is an outsider with a non-biased view of the department, and would have no favoritism, and would hold everyone accountable on an even scale,"" said one officer whose name wasn't attached to the survey results WPTV obtained.However, more officers urged the city to hire an internal candidate, specifically naming acting deputy chief Caleb Gillette. Those officers argued the decision would boost morale within the department.""You keep hiring from outside to put people in charge shows every prospective recruit that they will NEVER be considered for leadership under this City,"" said one officer whose name wasn't attached to the survey results WPTV obtained. ""Hiring from outside the Department sends a clear message, 'Work for the Police Department and you will never be trusted to actually lead here.'""The survey responses show that another officer reiterated the relationship between morale and promotions.""The opportunity for morale to improve is to promote from within,"" said one officer whose name wasn't attached to the survey results WPTV obtained. ""Morale is crushed immediately when you promote or choose someone from the outside to manage people who have spent their careers here. It is important to value the officers that have been working here enough so they want to stay and want to seek leadership positions.”According to the survey responses, many officers also blamed retention and recruitment issues on low pay and poor equipment. One officer argued these structural issues around funding would set up the new police chief for failure regardless of the choice.""I think the Chief will be incredibly set up for failure since the city commission doesn't want to raise officers' pay to a salary high enough to survive,"" said one officer whose name wasn't attached to the survey results. ""Officers will continue to leave, and we will remain a training ground for other police departments.""WPTV tracked raises for officers, which passed last September, after a months-long dispute between the union for police officers and the city of Fort Pierce. Before the agreement, the data we collected showed Fort Pierce police were one of the lowest-paid law enforcement departments in our viewing area.A spokesperson for the Fort Pierce Police Department declined to comment on this story to protect the integrity of the selection process.

"Stuart city manager faces potential firing","NewsTreasure CoastRegion Martin CountyStuart Stuart City Manager Mike Mortell faces potential firing as commissioners meet Monday night Taxpayers could be on the hook for $85,000 in severance pay if Mike Mortell is terminated without clear explanation WPTV Mike Mortell faces firing at Stuart City Commission Meeting By: Kate Hussey Posted STUART, Fla. — Stuart residents are expected to pack Monday night's city commission meeting as elected officials prepare to vote on whether to fire City Manager Mike Mortell. The controversy began Oct. 13 when Commissioner Sean Reed suddenly called for Mortell's resignation without providing specific reasons, saying only that he was not on the commission when Mortell was hired.WATCH BELOW: Stuart city manager faces potential firing Stuart city manager faces potential firing ""I am truly surprised at the approach tonight because I have been available and no one has called me to discuss terminating me once or to tell me why they were terminating me,"" Mortell said during the October meeting.According to Mortell's contract, firing him would trigger 20 weeks of severance pay costing taxpayers at least $85,000, plus additional expenses for recruiting a new city manager.Commissioners Chris Collins and Laura Giobbi have backed Reed's motion, with Giobbi citing ""trust issues"" but refusing to elaborate on what those concerns entail.""If your employer decided that he wanted to end your contract with you, would you be happy if he posted all those reasons on your internet so everyone in the company could see it?"" Giobbi said when pressed for details.""I think that the difference is this deals with taxpayer dollars, my job doesn't,"" investigative reporter Kate Hussey responded. ""It’s still a contract, I mean, we have a contract, you'd have to read the contract,"" Giobbi responded back. Collins suggested there might be ""more serious issues."" ""Sometimes it's just a personnel switch ... and if there's more serious issues that may have been alluded to at the last meeting, then I'm sure it'll come up,"" Collins said.""Are you aware of these serious issues, or are these just things other commissioners have alluded to?"" Hussey asked. ""It's tough because you can't talk, so you don't know how — what other interactions have happened,"" responded Collins. WPTV filed public records requests to see if there have been any complaints made by staff, elected officials or residents regarding Mortell, but we did not find any. Mortell's personnel file that we obtained also showed no complaints.Mayor Campbell Rich confirmed he was also unaware of any performance complaints against Mortell.""I am not aware of any complaints about Mike's performance, and I will be meeting with every department head to ask that,"" Rich told Hussey on the phone. However, some residents have independently raised concerns to us about overdevelopment and other issues under Mortell's leadership, sending us complaints they made about the city manager. Other taxpayers believe the commission should scrutinize his position regardless of cost. ""I'm not so much in favor of somebody being fired. I want to be very clear. I'm more in favor of his contract being reviewed. And if he's not abiding by his contract, then the commission holding him to that,"" resident Robin Cartwright said.Other residents have rallied behind Mortell, questioning the financial impact on taxpayers and pointing to Mortell's more than two decades of service with the city as a reason he should stay. ""It's the unintended consequences of what could come of this that really concerns me,"" Jeff Bowers, a local business owner and longtime Stuart resident, said.When asked whether the commission would consider taxpayer costs, Collins said, ""Obviously, every penny matters.""Reed has declined to address questions about his reasoning for seeking Mortell's termination on camera.

By: Matt Sczesny Posted and last updated STUART, Fla. — As Florida continues to face increasing flood threats from recent storms, many homeowners are still choosing to forgo flood insurance, potentially leaving themselves vulnerable to costly damages.The main issue is that flooding in Florida is almost always perceived as something that only happens near the coast, but experts warn that this mindset can lead to expensive consequences.WATCH BELOW: Flood insurance in Florida: Why is it overlooked despite risks? Flood insurance in Florida: Why is it overlooked despite risks? Anthony Conklin of Palm City represents many Florida homeowners when it comes to flood insurance decisions.""I think when we took a look at it the first time, when we bought the house and ran the numbers, it just didn't make sense,"" Conklin said. ""The likelihood of us getting a flood is probably small.""However, insurance experts say this thinking can be financially devastating.""(I heard once that) there's a quick cheat code to know if you need flood insurance in Florida.

Extreme weather raises need for flood insurance Wigglesworth said just over a third of his clients have flood insurance. These policies can range from $500 to $1,000 in low-risk areas, and flooding is becoming more of a threat with recent storms in the state that have left homeowners with denied claims.""We spend exorbitant amounts on hurricane protection, but what we tell our team and tell our clients is you're not fully protected from a hurricane unless you have flood insurance,"" Wigglesworth said.Currently, the Federal Flood Insurance Program is not writing any new policies because of the federal government shutdown.

"Reports to Medicare surge against Delray Beach medical supplier","NewsLocal NewsWPTV Investigates Seniors across US suspect Medicare fraud from Delray Beach company More than 2 dozen seniors say Sunshine Senior Solutions billed Medicare for equipment they never received WPTV By: Jamie Ostroff Posted PALM BEACH COUNTY, Fla. — More than two dozen Medicare recipients from across the country have contacted WPTV with reports of fraudulent billing from a Delray Beach company, with claims totaling more than $336,000 for medical equipment they say they never needed or received.Since Chief Investigator Jamie Ostroff first reported on Sunshine Senior Solutions in June, seniors from Ohio to Arizona to Illinois have reached out with similar stories. They all received Medicare statements showing thousands of dollars in charges for medical supplies like catheters and bladder drainage equipment they never ordered. WATCH: Seniors from across the country spoke to WPTV about Delray Beach company Reports to Medicare surge against Delray Beach medical supplier ""I got my Medicare Summary Notice last month, and I had been billed by a company called Sunshine Senior Solutions in Delray Beach, Florida,"" said Marty Rowe, a retired banker from Ohio. ""It was shocking. I've never used catheters."" The amounts being billed have increased since my original investigation. While earlier reports showed charges of $5,130, the recent claims are much higher.""$11,760 for intermittent urinary catheters, which I do not use. If I use them, I would certainly know that,"" Rowe said. MJ Clement, a military veteran from Arizona, saw charges on her Medicare summary totaling $15,460. She visited a senior community nearby and told management to warn residents about unrecognized charges from Sunshine Senior Solutions. Jim Dente, of New Jersey, had charges totaling $27,240 across multiple claims.""Stuff I've never heard of,"" Dente said about the medical equipment listed on his Medicare statement.When Laura Carmine noticed charges totaling $36,462 between her own Medicare account and her husband’s, she reached out to her suburban-Chicago pickleball group to see if others had noticed claims from Sunshine Senior Solutions. Four said they had.Members of Carmine’s pickleball group were among the 19 Medicare recipients who agreed to share their explanations of benefits with WPTV. Between them, Sunshine Senior Solutions had billed for more than $336,000 in charges worth of medical equipment. The University of Colorado Health system, which operates hospitals in Colorado and Wyoming, issued a fraud alert to Medicare beneficiaries about Sunshine Senior Solutions. A spokeswoman for the hospital system said they’d been notified by multiple patients that they’d received explanations of benefits with unrecognized claims from the Delray Beach business. UC Health also included a New York-based company in the alert. Every person who spoke with WPTV said they called Medicare's fraud hotline to report the suspicious billing.PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Seniors question Medicare charges from this Delray Beach company Seniors question Medicare charges from Delray Beach company ""And they said, 'We are aware of this. We're investigating,'"" said Peggy Foley, a member of Carmine’s pickleball group.Reading from her written notes while recounting her phone call to WPTV, Carmine added, ""The lady I talked to said, and I quote, ‘We get a lot of fraud from them. In the past three months, we've had beaucoup fraud complaints.’” We first contacted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about Sunshine Senior Solutions in April. A spokesperson wouldn't confirm or deny an ongoing investigation, explaining that fact-finding, legal review and multi-agency coordination can cause investigations to take months or even years. When we followed up with CMS five months later, they sent a similar response but added that the agency could suspend payments or revoke billing privileges if they have concerns about a provider. They could not comment on a specific provider. ""It's in the government's interest, in everybody's interest, for them to take care of this as soon as possible,"" said one of the affected seniors.All the people who spoke with WPTV said their secondary insurance denied the portion of the bill that Medicare didn't cover. But Medicare did pay a portion of these claims.""We pay for this. The taxpayers pay for this,"" Rowe said. WPTV The address for Sunshine Senior Solutions is a suite in this office on Linton Blvd. WPTV tried multiple times to get Sunshine's response to these allegations. Their phone number goes to a voicemail for someone named ""Sherry."" When Ostroff visited their office suite on Linton Boulevard in April, an employee said she couldn't answer my questions and directed me to call the same phone number.

Mike Caruso became court clerk and comptroller WPTV Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holds a news conference at Christ the King Catholic School in Jacksonville on May 11, 2021. By: Dave Bohman , Scott Sutton Posted and last updated WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday issued an executive order calling for a special election to fill House District 87, which has been vacant for the past two months.However, the timing of the election means the district will remain without a voice in Tallahassee for most of the upcoming legislative session.WATCH BELOW: Gov. DeSantis issues executive order to fill House District 87 Gov. DeSantis issues executive order to fill House District 87 The seat became vacant after former Rep. Mike Caruso resigned in August to become Palm Beach County's new court clerk and comptroller. The seat has been vacant since Aug. 19.House District 87 covers some of the wealthiest areas of Palm Beach County, and its constituents include President Donald Trump.The governor's executive order states that a special primary election will be held Jan. 13, 2026, followed by a special election on March 24, if necessary. The general election is scheduled two weeks after the legislative session is expected to conclude.WPTV spoke to one of those candidates, Emily Gregory, earlier this month after she filed a lawsuit to compel DeSantis to call a special election. ""I am proud that our lawsuit moved the needle,"" Gregory told WPTV Monday.When Florida's legislative session convenes in January, lawmakers are expected to address issues including new laws for illegal immigration, condo and insurance regulation.Gregory believes the district can get some representation if the session runs longer than expected.""We don't know if the session will go a month and a half over like last cycle. We don't know if there will be a special session in the summer,"" Gregory said.There are four announced candidates for House District 87: Democrats: Emily Gregory Laura Levites Republicans: Jon Maples Gretchen Miller FengFeng released the following statement to WPTV investigative reporter Dave Bohman on Monday:""I am pleased that the District 87 special election has finally been scheduled. I wish it had been sooner, so our residents would be fully represented during the upcoming legislative session. But it is what it is, and I look forward to talking with voters about the many serious issues we face. I'm in it to win it.""Levites released the following statement about the special election:""District 87 will have no advocate in the Florida House during the entire 2026 legislative session. That's not leadership; that's neglect. That's not freedom; that's failure. District 87's voters - Democrats, Republicans, Independents and everyone in between deserve better than excuses. They deserve action. Let's seize this opportunity to elect real change: a centrist voice rooted in our neighborhoods. See you in Tallahassee!""Critics say if the governor had called for a special election within days of appointing Caruso to the clerk of courts position, a primary and special election could have been scheduled earlier. The governor's office did not respond to a request for comment on that criticism.The winner of the special election will have one advantage: they can run again in 2026 as an incumbent.This story was reported on-air by a journalist.

If approved, this law will be named after Rachel Roth McKnight, a young Tampa Bay mother whose personal breast cancer journey helped inspire these changes. We’ve followed Rachel’s cancer and insurance battle since February.""It would be a huge relief for me, personally, but also just knowing that other people don't have to go through this is I can't even put it into words,"" Roth-McKnight said about what the legislation means to her.""I feel like patients finally have a voice again,"" said Dr. Alicia Billington, a reconstructive plastic surgeon in St. Pete who has joined a growing number of doctors taking their frustrations about patient insurance denials to social media.Billington is a staunch advocate for updating the Women’s Health & Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) with other members of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.WHCRA was implemented by Congress in 1998 to protect insurance coverage for breast cancer patients who undergo reconstructive surgeries after their mastectomies. But advocates say the nearly three-decade-old law has become outdated, paving the way for U.S. health insurance companies to find loopholes to justify claim denials.In February, investigative reporter Katie LaGrone and photographers Matthew Apthorp shared the stories of real women battling their disease while simultaneously fighting their insurer to cover costs, often for reconstruction after mastectomies. WPTV Investigates Cancer patient delayed chemo treatment because of insurance denials Katie LaGrone ""I was denied my reconstruction,"" one patient told us.""I was denied the type of mesh that my doctor recommended,"" another shared.""You get refused, refused and refused, you know, and you start thinking, Am I going to get through it?"" another patient explained.""All of us have been denied life-saving measures,"" Roth-McKnight told us during our group interview with patients.Roth-McKnight is a young mother of two diagnosed with breast cancer. She also tested positive for the BRCA gene, making her more susceptible to other cancers. Her list of denials from her insurance company was lengthy. She said she was initially denied her reconstruction surgery. In fact, Billington's office learned she was denied coverage while Billington was performing her reconstructive surgery. Eventually, the surgery got covered by her insurer, but not without a fight, said McKnight.""I feel like this isn't just about getting better and fighting the cancer, I'm also fighting them to cover my treatment,” she told us last month when we revisited her. ""Almost every major thing since then has been either a denial or a delay.""If approved, the proposed new legislation to update WHCRA would require insurance companies to cover any type of breast cancer-related reconstruction and future options as science, technology, and medicine continue to evolve.WATCH: Breast cancer patient continues battling her disease and insurance company Breast cancer patient continues battling her disease, her insurance company for coverage ""This is legislation that has never been filed before,"" Billington said.For doctors and patients, if approved, it will be life-changing. ""All of the frustration and all of the horrible things that they [patients] have gone through, it finally has meaning, and they are going to finally feel humanized again that the people want to help them and are on their side,"" Billington said. The legislation was spearheaded by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). Billington, a member of the organization, traveled to Washington, D.C. this summer with other members to meet with lawmakers, including Cammack, who decided to sponsor the legislation with Dingell. The bill still needs a sponsor in the U.S. Senate.""Women should be fighting cancer rather than insurance companies. Every woman battling breast cancer deserves access to the best care modern medicine can offer—not limits based on outdated insurance codes and bureaucratic red tape,” Cammack said. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons believes the legislation, if approved, will be a game-changer for breast cancer patients.“This important legislation will improve patient access to all types of breast and chest wall reconstruction. ASPS developed and fought for its introduction because ASPS Member Surgeons have an unrelenting commitment to every patient and their right to complete reconstructive care. In no place is this right more clear and more impactful, than with post-cancer care.""A spokesperson from the AHIP, a trade organization for the health insurance industry, said they could support the legislation.“Health plans work to connect patients with safe, clinically appropriate care and welcome opportunities to work with policymakers and stakeholders to address gaps in care adequately and precisely while promoting affordability for consumers and sustainability within our health care system,” the spokesperson stated.As for the informal name, ""Rachel's Law,"" Billington said it was a no-brainer.""When we were thinking about the name, I just thought Rachel is the first person that I thought of, because she's the one that started all this,"" Billington said. When asked about having the law named after her, McKnight became overwhelmed with emotion.""I don't really feel like it's something I deserve. It's an honor,” she said. “I take it as a sign that I need to continue to use the position that I have to advocate for everyone,"" she said.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.
